    "# TermRecord Linkage\n",
    "\n",
    "This task aims to link ConceptRecords from different documents. This will be beneficial to remove ambiguity of historical data. Take encyclopaedia Britannica for example, a term with a specific name could have multiple meanings (concepts) - Polysemy. When studying how language changes, it would be good to link and compare the terms with same concept across years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs: basic knowledge graph (terms records), dataframe with term information, uri, and embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. List all distinct term names in the dataframe\n",
    "2. For each term name: get a list of all the terms info with that name, get a list of distinct years, and sort it\n",
    "   1. for each year in the list, for each term in that year, if there is no concept uri are linked to the term, then create new one. find the most similar term with the same name in each following years, then link the same concept uri to those terms if not exists. keep the process until no further years\n",
    "3. Add concept uri to the knowledge graph, and link the concept with term record."
