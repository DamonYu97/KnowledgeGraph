# Knowledge Graphs for Textual Heritage

This repository includes code and sources to create knowledge graphs for digitised textual heritage.
Knowledge Graphs generated here are based on the [Heritage Text Ontology](https://github.com/frances-ai/HeritageTextOntology).
Note that this repository does not introduce any methods to extract information from the source digital datasets whose formats
varies, instead, we utilise the dataframes generated from [Information Extraction for frances Project](https://github.com/frances-ai/frances-InformationExtraction).
