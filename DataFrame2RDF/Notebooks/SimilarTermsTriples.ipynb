      "a preparation from the fish known by the name of huso. The word is Greek, formed of 7χSυj, fish, and %oλλα, glue. The method of making isinglass was long a secret in the hands of the Russians. The following account of it was published by Mr Humphrey Jackson, in the 63d volume of the Philosophical Transactions.\n",
      "“All authors who have hitherto delivered processes for making ichthyocolla, fish-glue, or isinglass, have greatly mistaken both its constituent matter and preparation. To prove this assertion, it may not be improper to recite what Pomet says upon the subject, as he appears to be the principal author, whom the rest have copied. After describing the fish, and referring to a cut engraved from an original in his custody, he says, ‘ As to the manner of making the isinglass, the sinewy parts of the fish are boiled in water till all of them be dissolved that will dissolve; then the gluey liquor is strained, and set to cool. Being cold, the fat is carefully taken off, and the liquor itself boiled to a just consistency, then cut to pieces and made into a twist, bent in form of a crescent as commonly sold; then hung upon a string and carefully dried.’\n",
      "“From this account, it might be rationally concluded that every species of fish which contained gelatinous principles would yield isinglass; and this parity of reasoning seems to have given rise to the hasty conclusions of those who strenuously vouch for the extraction of isinglass from sturgeon; but as that fish is easily procurable, the negligence of ascertaining the fact by experiment seems inexcusable.\n",
      "“In my first attempt to discover the constituent parts and manufacture of isinglass, relying too much upon the authority of some chemical authors whose veracity I had experienced in many other instances, I found myself constantly disappointed. Glue, not isinglass, was the result of every process; and although, in the same view, a journey to Russia proved fruitless, yet a steady perseverance in the research proved not only successful as to this object, but in the pursuit to discover a resinous matter plentifully procurable in the British fisheries, which has been found by ample experience to answer similar purposes. It is now no longer a secret that the lakes and rivers in North America are stocked with immense quantities of fish, said to be the same species with those in Muscovy, and yielding the finest isinglass; the fisheries whereof, under due encouragement, would doubtless supply all Europe with this valuable article.\n",
      "“No artificial heat is necessary to the production of isinglass, neither is the matter dissolved for this purpose; for, as the continuity of its fibres would be destroyed by solution, the mass would become brittle in drying, and snap short asunder, which is always the case with glue, but never with isinglass. The latter, indeed, may be resolved into glue with boiling water; but its fibrous recomposition would be found impractlcable afterwards, and a fibrous texture is one of the most distinguishing characteristics of genuine isinglass.\n",
      "“A due consideration that an imperfect solution of isinglass, called fining by the brewers, possessed a peculiar property of clarifying malt liquors, induced me to attempt its analysis in cold subacid menstruums. One ounce and a half of good isinglass, steeped a few days in a gallon of stale beer, was converted into good fining, of a remarkable thick consistence; the same quantity of glue, under similar treatment, yielded only a mucilaginous liquor, resembling diluted gum-water, which, instead of clarifying beer, increased both its tenacity and turbidness, and communicated other properties in no respect corresponding with those of genuine fining. On commixing three spoonfuls of the solution of isinglass with a gallon of malt liquor, in a tall cylindrical glass, a vast number of curdly masses became presently formed, by the reciprocal attraction of the particles of isinglass and the feculen-cieş of the beer, which increasing in magnitude and specific gravity, arranged themselves accordingly, and fell in a combined state to the bottom, through the well-known laws of gravitation; for in this case there is no elective attraction, as some have imagined, which bears the least affinity with what frequently occurs in chemical decompositions.\n",
      "“If what is commercially termed long or short stapled isinglass be steeped a few hours in fair cold water, the untwisted membranes will expand, and re-assume their original beautiful hue,^[1. If the transparent isinglass be held in certain positions to the light, it frequently exhibits beautiful prismatic colours. ] and, by a dexterous address, may be perfectly unfolded. By this simple operation we find that isinglass is nothing more than certain membranous parts of fishes, divested of their native mucosity, rolled and twisted into the forms above mentioned, and dried in open air.\n",
      "“The sounds or air-bladders of fresh-water fish in general are preferred for this purpose, as being the most transparent, flexible, delicate substances. These constitute the finest sorts of isinglass; those called booh and ordinary staple are made of the intestines, and probably of the peritoneum of the fish. The belluga yields the greatest quantity, as being the largest and most plentiful fish in the Muscovy rivers; but the sounds of all fresh-water fish yield, more or less, fine isinglass, particularly the smaller sorts, found in prodigious quantities in the Caspian Sea, and several hundred miles beyond Astracan, in the Wolga, Yaik, Don, and even as far as Siberia, where it is called hle or kla by the natives, which implies a glutinous matter; it is the basis of the Russian glue, which is preferred to all other kinds for its strength.\n",
      "“The sounds, which yield the finer isinglass, consist of parallel fibres, and are easily rent longitudinally; but the ordinary sorts are found composed of double membranes, whose fibres cross each other obliquely, resembling the coats of a bladder; hence the former are more readily pervaded and divided with subacid liquors; but the latter, through a peculiar kind of interwoven texture, are with great difficulty torn asunder, and long resist the power of the same menstruum; yet, when duly resolved, are found to act with equal energy in clarifying liquors.\n",
      "“Isinglass receives its different shapes in the following manner: The parts of which it is composed, particularly the sound, are taken from the fish while sweet and fresh, slit open, washed from their slimy sordes, divested of every thin membrane which envelopes the sound, and then exposed to stiffen a little in the air. In this state they are formed into rolls about the thickness of a finger, and in length according to the intended size of the staple. A thin membrane is generally selected for the centre of the roll, round which the rest are folded alternately; and about half an inch of each extremity of the roll is turned inwards. The due dimensions being thus obtained, the two ends of what is called short staple are pinned together with a small wooden peg; the middle of the roll is then pressed a little downwards, which gives it the resemblance of a heart-shape; and thus it is laid on boards, or hung up in the air to dry. The sounds which compose the long staple are longer than the former; but the operator lengthens this sort at pleasure, by interfolđing the ends of one or more pieces of the sound with each other. The extremities are fastened with a peg, like the former; but the middle part of the roll is bent more considerably downwards, and, in order to preserve the shape of the three obtuse angles thus formed, a piece of round stick, about a quarter of an inch diameter, is fastened in each angle with small wooden pegs, in the same manner as the ends. In this state it is permitted to dry long enough to retain its form, when the pegs and sticks are taken out, and the drying completed; lastly, the pieces of isinglass are colligated in rows, by running pack-thread through the peg-holes, for convenience of package and exportation.\n",
      "“The membranes of the book sort, being thick and refractory, will not admit a similar formation with the preceding; the pieces, therefore, after their sides are folded inwardly, are bent in the centre, in such manner that the opposite sides resemble the cover of a book, from whence its name; a peg being run across the middle, fastens the sides together, and thus it is dried like the former. This sort is interleaved, and the pegs run across the ends, the better to prevent its unfolding.\n",
      "“That called cake∙isinglass is formed of the bits and fragments of the staple sorts, put into a flat metalline pan, with a very little water, and heated just enough to make the parts cohere like a pancake when it is dried; but frequently it is overheated, and such pieces, as before observed, are useless in the business of fining. Experience has taught the consumers to reject them.\n",
      "“Isinglass is best made in the summer, as frost gives it a disagreeable colour, deprives it of weight, and impairs its gelatinous principles; its fashionable forms are unnecessary, and frequently injurious to its native qualities. It is common to find oily putrid matter, and exuvicε of insects, between the implicated membranes, which, through the inattention of the cellarman, often contaminate wines and malt liquors in the act of clarification. These peculiar shapes might probably be introduced originally with a view to conceal and disguise the real substance of isinglass and preserve the monopoly; but, as the mask is now taken off, it cannot be doubted to answer every purpose more effectually in its native state, without any subsequent manufacture whatever, especially to the principal consumers, who hence will be enabled to procure sufficient supply from the British colonies. Until this laudable end can be fully accomplished, and as a species of isinglass more easily produceable from the marine fisheries may probably be more immediately enco\n",

      "one of the United States of North America, is bounded on the north by the territory of Huron; on the east by Lake Michigan and the state of Indiana; on the south by the Ohio river, which separates it from Kentucky; and on the west by the Mississippi, which separates it from the state and territory of Missouri. It lies between lat. 37° and 42° 30' north, and long. 87° 20' and 91° 20' west, being about 380 miles in length from north to south, and 210 miles in width from east to west, and comprehending an area of 58,900 square miles. Next to Louisiana and Delaware, this is considered as the most level state in the Union. There are a few hills, and some elevations that might be designated mountains; but by far the greater portion of the state consists of beautiful and fertile prairies, finely diversified with wood. These prairies or meadows, which are sometimes of vast extent, are distinguished by the names of wet and dry, alluvial and rolling. The wet prairies contain peat, logs of wood, and exhibit other indications of their having once been morasse^ in which wood grew. The origin of many of the rivers is to be traced to these prairies. Those of an alluvial nature are high and dry, of a rich black loam, which is exceedingly fertile; and they are covered with a coarse kind of grass, which grows to an enormous size. 1he high and rolling prairies are sometimes chequered with groves of sparse trees. Their soil is in general only of second rate quality, and they abound in springs. Grape vines are abundant; und they furnish an inexhaustible summer range for cattle. From the exceeding flatness of some θf the plains, and their consequent want of inclination, the rain that falls is not carried off, but allowed to remain and stagnate, so that such situations are very unhealthy. Grand Prairie is the largest tract of land of this description. The first stratum of soil is a black, friable, and sandy loam, from two to five feet in thickness. The next is a red clay mixed with fine sand, and from five to ten feet in thickness. The third is a hard blue clay, of a beautiful appearance and greasy feel, mixed with pebbles, and, when exposed to the air, capable of emitting a fetid odour. This soil is of the first quality, and here the springs are found. Strawberries are raised in immense quantities, and of the very finest quality. Timber, however, is scarce, and good water is likewise deficient.\n",
      "Between Carlisle and St Louis a tract of country fifty miles in extent, woods, streams, hills, limestone ledges, and a rolling country, present themselves. The hills here abound in stone coal, and limestone is also plentiful. A range of hills commences at the bluffs which bound the “American bottom,” near Kaskaskia, and stretches north-eastwardly through the state towards Lake Michigan. Another k.ne-stone bluff breaks off almost at right angles to this chain, and stretches along the margin of the American bottom to the point nearly opposite the Missouri. This bluff has in many places a regular front of perpendicular limestone, not unfrequently 300 feet in height. There are other chains of bluffs, which are marked by the same grand natural features. The American bottom commences not far below Kaskaskia, and stretches eighty miles along the shores of the Mississippi. It is from three to six miles in width, and forms two belts, the one, which borders the Mississippi, having a heavy timbered bottom, and the other, which reaches the foot of the perpendicular bluffs, being prairie of the richest quality. For above one hundred years crops of maize have been raised on some parts of this tract, without the slightest exhaustion of soil having become apparent. Vegetation here flourishes most luxuriantly; but there is a counterbalance in the unhealthiness of the climate, particularly during autumn. On either bank of the Illinois, almost from its mouth to its source, there is a similar bottom, with bluffs and chains of hills similar to the preceding. The military bounty tract, which is distributed amongst the soldiers of the late war, commences in the neighbourhood of Lower Alton. It comprehends the northwest corner of the state, about 170 miles long and sixty broad, and is situated between the rivers Mississippi and Illinois. This district of country has great advantages; the t>oil is rich and extremely fertile, and much of the prairie ground is eminently beautiful; but the situation is unhealthy. Not only in this state, but over all the western territory, the lands seem to be distributed in bodies, either of rich or sterile, or of level or broken lands. On Rock River, the Illinois, the Kaskaskia, Embarras, between the Big and Little Wabash, on the Parassaw, the Macoupin, the Sangamon, and on all the other considerable streams of this state, there are very large tracts of first-rate land. The Grand Prairie, the Mound Prairie, the prairie upon which the marine settlement is fixed, and that occupied by a society of Christians from New England, are all exceedingly rich. The Sangamon district of country, in particular, presents a happy proportion of timbered and prairie lands, and a soil of great fertility, whilst accounts from various quarters concur in representing it as more healthy than any other part of the state. The prevailing trees are, the locust, black walnut, and pecean; and there is a vast summer range for cattle. Iron and copper ore, salt springs, gypsum, and stone coal, are.abundant; and the whole district is now divided into a number of populous counties, and is thickly settled by thriving farmers. Along the course of the Kaskaskia or Okau, tracts of land equally extensive and fine are stretched. This river has a long course through the central parts of the state, and a country beautifully di versified with hill, vale, prairie, and forest. On its banks is Kaskaskia, formerly the seat of government; and Vandalia, at present the metropolis. A late traveller (Stuart, Three Years in North America, vol. ii. p. 379) thus speaks of Illinois: “The general description of the state of Illinois is, that it contains 58,900 square miles; is the fourth state in point of extent in the union, oņly inferior in this respect to Virginia, Georgia, and Missouri, with a general level, not varying above sixty feet; and that it consists, with little interruption, of one vast prairie of admirable soil, extending from the Mississippi to Lake Michigan. It is the richest country in point of soil in the world. The French called it the terrestrial paradise.”\n",
      "Count Marbois thus writes 'of this country generally: “At the junction of the Mississippi and Missouri, the lands lying towards the north-west are of admirable fertility. Emigration already inclines there; and these districts, though very remote from the sea, will one day be as well peopled as any other country in the world. The Mississippi, the Missouri, the Arkansas, and the Red River, and their tributaries, water 200,000 square leagues within the space of country called the basin of the Mississippi. This internal navigation, prepared by nature, has already been wonderfully extended and improved by canals, excavated by the labour of man; and steam-boats descend and ascend against wind and tide, brave the most rapid currents with more speed, and with more convenience, than the finest roads in Europe can be travelled. Wood and coal, indispensable agents in this navigation, abound on the shores of the rivers; and the steam-engine has put an end to the difíiculty of communication, heretofore one of the greatest obstacles that were ever opposed to the improvement of colonies.”\n",
      "Illinois is particularly fortunate, not only in the number, but in the navigability, of its rivers. For a great distance on its northern extent it has the waters of Lake Michigan, and the boatable streams that are therein discharged; and by this means a communication is opened with the northern fronts of Indiana and Ohio, with New York and Canada. On the north-west is Rock River, a long, beautiful, and boatable tributary of the Mississippi. Its whole western front is washed by the latter river, and its northern by the Ohio. On the east is the Wabash, which has a course of about 130 miles, the greater part of it being navigable; and through its centre winds in one direction the Illinois, which connects the Mississippi with Lake Michigan by the Plein and Kankakee, whilst in another direction the Kaskaskia traverses the state for a distance of between 200 and 300 miles. At present the state is supposed to include 4000 miles of boatable waters within its limits. The Illinois, which gives name to the state, may be considered as the most important river in North America, having its whole course within one state. It is formed by the junction of two other rivers in the north-west part of Indiana, and, passing into Illinois, pursues generally a south-westerly direction, and flows into the Mississippi twenty-one miles above the Missouri. It is upwards of 400 yards wide at its mouth, is about 400 miles long, and is of easy navigation. Its current, which is very gentle, is unbroken by falls or rapids, and it passes through a fine country.\n",
      "In this state there are prodigious lead mines, as well as those of coal and lime. There is also building stone in the bounty tract. Specimens of native malleable copper have been found, weighing from one to three pounds. On the Saline River, a branch of the Ohio, are salt springs, from which salt is manufactured at a cheap rate. About 300,000 bushels of this article are annually made. The lead mines are situated at Galena, on Fever River, near the north-west corner of the state. The working of them commenced in 1821, andjn 1824 there were made 175,220 lbs. of lead. In the year 1829 the produce had amounted to 13,343,150 lbs.\n",
      "The prevailing forest tree in Illinois is oak, of which thirteen or fourteen different species are enumerated. Throughout the territory there are also found honey locust, black walnut, mulberry, plum, su\n",

      "----\n",
      "one of the United States of North America, is bounded on the north by Lake Michigan, and the territory of the same name; on the south by Kentucky; on the east by Ohio; and on the west by Illinois. It extends from Lat. 37° 50 ’ to Lat. 41° 45 ’ north; and from Long. 84° 45 ’ to Long. 88° west; being 270 miles in length, 220 in breadth, and containing a superficies of 36,000 square miles. Although this state is more hilly than Illinois, it contains no mountains of any great height. The southern front has the usual belt of river hills, bluffs, and knobs, known by the name of Ohio Hills, which often rise immediately from the waters of the Ohio, in forms of picturesque grandeur and beauty, and sometimes retreat from it to a considerable distance, leaving between the river and their base, a bottom of two or three miles in extent. A range of hills, called the Knobs, stretching from the Ohio to White River of the Wabash, forms the limits of the table ìanđs which separate the waters of the Ohio from those of White River. North of the Wabash, the hills which bear the same name, are precipitous, and the country is to a considerable extent broken and rugged. Large portions of the state may be pronounced hilly, but three-fifths of it at least consist of vast tracts of level country. The wide extent of land watered by the White River is for the most part level. The prairies, so characteristic of the New World, have the usual distinction of high and low, swampy and alluvial. They differ in no respect from those of Illinois, being alike rich, level, and prolific of grass and flowering plants. Those which are situated along the course of the Wabash have been particularly admired for their beauty and fertility. Many of the prairies are long and naιrow, some of them, like those of Illinois, are larger than can be taken in at once by the eye, and others are only large enough for a few farms. They are usually bounded by dense forests, and are not unfrequently adorned with copses of small trees. In spring and summer, the luxuriant growth of grass and fragrant flowers, with which they are covered, rises to from six to eight feet in height. For a considerable extent on the northern frontier of the state, between the Wabash and Lake Michigan, the country is for the most part an extended plain, alternately prairie and woodland, diversified by swamps, and by small lakes and ponds. No part of the western world presents larger tracts of rich land, than that portion of White River country, of which Indianopolis, the capital of the state, is the centre. The river or low prairies are levels destitute of timber, and are said to exhibit vestiges of former cultivation. The high or upland prairies are elevated from thirty to one hundred feet above the others, and are far more numerous and extensive. The ordinary depth of the vegetable soil is from two to five feet, but in some places it has been found to extend twenty-two feet downwards. The forest trees, shrubs, plants, and grasses, do not materially differ from those of Illinois, but there is a much greater proportion of beech timber. The principal productions of the state are wheat, Indian corn, rye, oats, barley, buckwheat, and potatoes. There are some prairies and “bottoms” too rich for growing wheat, until the natural wild luxuriance of the soil has been somewhat reduced by cropping. Upland rice has been cultivated with success, and some of the more sheltered and warm valleys have, in favourable years, yielded considerable crops of cotton. This state is exceedingly well adapted for rearing the finest fruits, and fruit-bearing shrubs. There are in many places abundance of wild berries; and on some of the prairies the strawberries are large and fine. It is stated that in the low prairies in the northern parts, whole tracts are covered with the beautiful fowl meadow-grass, the Poa pratensis of the north. But wherever the natural prairie grass has been destroyed by being pastured by domestic animals, it is succeeded by the blue grass of the western country, which furnishes not only a beautiful sward, but covers the ground with a carpeting of rich fodder, not unlike the second crop, which is cut in the northern states as the most valuable kind of hay. For all the objects of farming, and raising of grain, hemp, tobacco, and other necessaries, and the rearing of cattle, sheep, swine, horses, as well as other animals, the emigrant could not find a more advantageous country than Indiana. In the rich “bottoms” of the southern parts, the reed cane, and uncommonly large ginseng, are abundant.\n",
      "This state possesses a great number of rivers and springs, very happily distributed over the country. Their origin is generally to be traced to swamps or lakes, and the surrounding districts are too low and wet for cultivation. The southern extremity is well watered throughout its whole length by the Ohio; and into this noble stream a considerable number of tributaries flow. But the chief river of Indiana is the Wabash, which, after Tennessee, is one of the most considerable tributaries of the Ohio. It traverses the central parts of the state, and, by its extensive branches, irrigates a great portion thereof. White River enters the Wabash from the eastern side, sixteen miles below Vincennes. It is the most considerable tributary of the Wabash, and one of the most important ∙rivers of the state. It waters a vast tract of very fertile country, in a lateral direction to the main stream. It receives a great number of considerable tributaries from the west, and several smaller ones enter it from the eastern side. White Water, which rises in Ohio, waters a large portion of fertile country. The northern frontier of the state, bordering on the territory of Michigan, and the lake of the same name, is watered copiously by rivers which discharge their waters into that lake and Lake Erie. The courses of these streams are generally short, but they carry along large volumes of water. Most of them have their origin in lakes and ponds, of which above one hundred exist along the northern frontier. Many of them have the peculiar character of the waters in this region; that is, they are situated on an elevated plateau, from one extremity of which the waters are discharged into the lakes, and from the other into the waters of the Mississippi. The amount of inland navigation of Indiana is great, although it is not equal to that of Illinois. It possesses the whole extent of the Wabash and White River, with its numerous branches navigable by fly-boats. A navigable canal now connects the White Water with the Ohio, at Cincinnati; others are either completed, in progress, or in contemplation; and, as the wealth and commerce of the state increase, it will emulate the enterprise, the canals, and the great public works of the sister state of Ohio. The whole recent extent of inland navigation which it enjoys may be fairly computed at 5000 miles. A great national road, passing from east to west through the state, is in progress, and a rail-road, from Ohio to Lake Michigan, has been projected.\n",
      "The climate of Indiana resembles that of Illinois, and the other neighbouring states. That part of it which is contiguous to Lake Michigan is subject to copious rains, and, being otherwise low and marshy, much of the land is unfit for cultivation. For a considerable distance from the lake, sand heaps covered with a few stunted junipers, and swept by the gales of the lake, give little promise of a fine country or propitious climate. But beyond the point to which the breezes of the lake extend, the climate is mild and temperate. The state in general is rather less exposed than Illinois to the extremes of heat and cold. The climate is in general healthy; indeed, the astonishing increase of the population within a few years, affords a proof of this. The higher regions are, of course, more so than those which are low and are swampy. The winters are mild, compared with those of New England or Pennsylvania. Winter commences in its severity about Christmas, but seldom lasts longer than six weeks. During this period, the rivers which have not very rapid currents are frozen; although winters occur in which the Wabash cannot be crossed upon the ice. Snow does not fall to any great depth; in the middle and southern parts rarely more than six inches. Peach trees are generally in blossom early in March, and the foliage of the forest assumes its green tint in the middle of April.\n",
      "The interior and northern parts of this state are abundantly stocked with game. Bears, and especially deer, are common. Wild turkeys abound, and prairie hens, partridges, and grouse are seen in countless numbers. The streams, especially those which communicate with Lake Michigan, are stocked with fish of various kinds and the best qualities. Venomous reptiles are sometimes met with, most commonly in the vicinity of ledges of rocks. The rattlesnake and the copper-head are the most numerous and dangerous.\n",
      "There are salt springs in different parts of the state, but they do not appear to be wrought to any extent. Stone-coal of the best quality is found in various places. Native copper has been discovered in small masses, in the northern parts of the state. Iron-ore is also found in some places. But in general it is too level a country to afford many minerals.\n",
      "Like Alabama and Tennessee, this state abounds with subterranean wonders, such as caves. Many of these have been explored, and some of them have been described. One of them is generally known in the western country by the name of the Epsom Salts Cave. It is situated at a short distance from Jeffersonville. When first discovered, the salts were represented as being ⅛ome inches deep on the floor. The interior of this cave possesses the usual domes and chambers of extensive caverns, through which the visitant gropes his way inwards for a mile and a quarter, till he reaches the Pillar, which is a splendid column, 15 feet in diameter, and 25 feet \n",

      "----\n",
      "in a general sense, denotes want of faith or belief in regard to any subject or transaction. Religious Infidelity signifies a disbelief of Christianity.\n",
      "“Of all the methods,” says Dr Knox, “which the vanity of man has devised with a view to acquire distinction, there is none easier than that of professing a disbelief of the established religion. That which shocks the feelings of those with whom we converse, cannot fail of attracting notice; and as the vain are usually confident, they utter their doubts with an air so oracular and decisive, as induces the simple to think them profoundly wise. Audacity, with little ingenuity, will attract the eyes of spectators, and this will sufficiently answer the purpose of many amongst the professed unbelievers. One might be diverted, if one were not hurt, at seeing a circle of silly admirers, gaping and fixing their eyes on some half-learned and impudent prater, who throws out oblique insinuations against the Bible, the clergy, or the sacrament. These are fertile topics of wit and ingenuity; but it might mortify the vanity of some very vain writers and talkers, if they were to recollect, what is undoubtedly true, that it is a species of wit and ingenuity which not only the vilest, but the most stupid and illiterate of mankind, have frequently displayed in all its possible perfection.\n",
      "“There is indeed no doubt, but that vanity is one of the principal causes of infidelity. It must be the sole cause of communicating it to others, by writing or conversation. For let us suppose the case of a very humane, judicious, and learned man, entertaining doubts of the truth of Christianity: If he cannot clear his doubts by examination, he will yet recollect that doubts are no certainties; and, before he endeavours to propagate his scepticism, he will ask himself these questions: ‘ Am I quite convinced that what I doubt of cannot possibly be true? If I am convinced of it, am I sure that the publication of my opinions will not do more harm than good? Is not the disturbing of any long-established civil constitution attended with confusion, rebellion, bloodshed, and ruin? And are not the majority of men more strongly attached to the religion than the government of their forefathers? Will it serve my country to introduce discontent of any species? May not those innovations in religion, which discontent may introduce, lead to all the evils which are caused by frenzy and fanaticism? 'Granting that I were able to make a party formidable enough to crush opposition and to exterminate Christianity, still am I certain that I act, in this instance, like a good member of society? For is not this system, whether well or ill founded, friendly to society? I must confess it; its greatest enemies have acknowledged it. What motive, then, can induce me to divulge my doubts of its authenticity? Not the good of mankind; for it is already allowed by unbelievers, that the good of mankind is interested in the belief of its divine original. Is it for my own good, and with a view to be convinced? I will not deceive myself: my motive, I suspect, is of another kind; for do I read those books which have been already written to satisfy similar doubts? Nothing but the vanity of appearing to be wiser than my credulous neighbours can induce me to interrupt the happiness of their belief. But vanity of this sort, which tends to disturb society, to injure the national morals, and to rob many thousand individuals of a copious source of sweet and solid comfort, must be pronounced extreme wickedness, even according to the obvious dictates of natural religion. I shall act the part of a good citizen and a good man, by conforming to a system whose beneficial influence I feel and confess, and by endeavouring to acquire a belief in that which has for so many centuries been established, and which promises to soothe me in distress with the sweetest consolations, and to brighten the dismal hour of death, by the hope of a more glorious and happy state of existence. At all events, I shall have the satisfaction of having commanded myself so far, as not to have run the hazard of endangering the welfare of my fellow-creatures, either here or hereafter, by indulging a degree of vanity, which, in a creature so weak and so shortlived as myself, is a folly very inconsistent with the supe rior wisdom which I seem to arrogate.”\n",
      "“I will venture to repeat,” continues our author, “that all writers against Christianity, however they may affect even the extremes of benevolence, honour, philosophy, and enlargement of mind, are actuated by vanity and wickedness of heart. Their motives are as mean, selfish, narrow, and in every respect unjustifiable, as the tendency of their writings is mischievous. Their malice is often impotent, through the foolish sophistry of their arguments; but, if ever it be successful, it is highly injurious: and, indeed, considering their motives, and the probable consequences of their endeavours, the infidel writer is a greater enemy to society, and consequently guiltier, according to all the principles of social union, than the thief or the traitor. Persecution would, however, only promote his cause, and his proper punishment is contempt.\n",
      "“It is certainly no derogation from the character of a man of sense, to conform, even while he is so unfortunate as to doubt their truth, to the opinions of his country. His conformity will probably lead him to a train of actions and of thought, which, in due time, will induce him to believe. But, if that should not happen, yet he will act, as very wise and very great men have acted, in paying a respectful deference to the avowed conviction of others. The most intelligent and powerful men of ancient Rome, not only appeared to believe a very absurd and hurtful system, but assisted in all its ceremonies as priests. Even Socrates, who evidently entertained some notions adequate to the dignity of the one great and supreme Being, yet thought it was a duty which he owed to his country, so far to conform to the wretched establishment, as to order in his dying words a sacrifice to AEsculapius. This external conformity to the national religion ought not to be confounded with hypocrisy. If, indeed, it is carried to extremes, or zealously affected, it certainly is very blameable and contemptible deceit; but while it keeps within the bounds of reason and moderation, it ought to be called a decent deference to the opinions of the majority, arising from humility, and from a desire to maintain the tranquillity of the state, and to continue an innocent and useful system, which has, and will always greatly contribute to lessen the quantity and degree both of moral and of natural evil.\n",
      "“The easiest, after all, or at least the most effectual method of appearing in any character, is really to be what we wish to appear. But belief, you will say, is not in our power, and how can we believe what appears to us incredible? Certainly you cannot while it appears incredible. But let me ask you, whether you have taken any pains to believe, or have at once and at a glance persuaded yourself, that the Christian religion is totally false? It is probable that a great number of sceptical writers never gave themselves the trouble to read those Scriptures which they warmly oppose. They hear objections, they read objections, and they find, that from men of reputed wit and ingenuity the objections often originate. They also wish to be reputed men of wit and ingenuity, and therefore eagerly adopt the language and sentiments of the order. Perhaps the vanity and pride of this class of men will render all attempts to convince them abortive; but to modest doubters, and to those whose good sense and good dispositions lead them to wish to adopt the religion of their country, it may not be useless to suggest advice, with a view to facilitate their conviction.\n",
      "“The chief thing required is to free themselves from the pride of human reason. Humility (and surely our blindness and imperfections are sufficient to render us humble, if we would be reasonable), humility will open our hearts, and belief will find admission. Sincere endeavours, seconded by prayers, will never fail to help our unbelief. But, alas! a fine, gay, spirited, liberal, and enlarged modern philosopher, would be ashamed to be found on his knees, or with a Testament in his possession. There is scarcely any vicious act, or any vicious book, which would put him so much to the blush.\n",
      "“A modest well-meaning man might, however, one should think, divest himself of those prejudices which prevent the possibility of belief, by the following soliloquy :— I find myself placed in a world abounding with evil and misery. Under the immediate pressure of it, I feel my heart inclining, like the needle to the north, by its natural tendency, to the Deity for support. Man, of all animals, is the only one who has the sense of religion. Feeling this distinctive propensity of my nature, I look around to discover to what object, and in what manner, that part of my fellow creatures, who live in the same society with myself, pay their adoration. I find a system of religion already established, and which has been established in the most enlightened countries of the earth near two thousand years. I resolve to examine it. It claims that respect from its antiquity and universality. Many difficulties appear on the first inspection. My reason is often startled, and my belief wavers. But I will not yet give up a point of so serious importance, without further and closer attention to it. I reflect, that two thousand years is a vast space in the age of the world. How many myriads of men like myself have lived and died in the faith during that time. And were all of them fools or hypocrites? It could not have been. Can the understanding of a poor individual, just come into the world, and hardly knowing where he is, comprehend on intuition an object of such magnitude, and make the mighty discovery which has escap\n",

      "in Natural History. See Entomology. Noxious Insects; Means of destroying them, or preventing their increase. Of those substances which have been generally observed to be efficacious in driving away or in destroying insects, mercury, and its various preparations, may be reckoned the most generally effectual. Sulphur is also useful. Oils of all kinds have often been deservedly recommended; and tobacco is not less remarkable for its utility.\n",
      "Mercury is known to kill or drive away lice from the human body; and it may probably be of equal efficacy in ridding other animals of insects. For instance, a small quantity of mercurial ointment rubbed upon the skins of sheep, on the sides, between the fore-legs and the body, may kill or drive away the insect peculiar to these animals. Sulphur is recommended to be added to the mercurial ointment. Thus not only the insect peculiar to them, but also the scab, may be cured.^[1. Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, London, vol. víL viii. p. 90. ] Ailway^[2. Ibid. vol. V. vi. p. 59. ] directed that, in the winter, the walls, frames, and other parts of his green and hot houses should be well washed with corrosive sublimate mercury, dissolved in water. These houses had been greatly in fested with red spiders and ants. After having been washed • with this solution, neither of these were to be seen next summer. This wash, if made weaker, may be used on old garden-walls, and the roots of fruit-trees infested with in- • sects. It may destroy the tender leaves of plants, though not the roots. The same wash will effectually destroy that dis- • agreeable insect the bug, and all other insects of a tender cuticle; and it will not in the least hurt the colour of bedfurniture or hangings. Care must be taken that the wash be applied into every crevice or folding of the furniture with a painter’s brush. It will sometimes be necessary to repeat the wash, as the ova of bugs may remain concealed, notwithstanding the utmost care.\n",
      "Some of the West India islands were much infested with large ants, which greatly injured the sugar-canes. The remedy was, to dissolve corrosive sublimate mercury in rum, in the proportion of two drams to a pint of spirits. This solution was poured upon dry powdered sugar; and when the sugar was dried, it was laid in the paths of the ants. They ate it, and were destroyed. Might not this practice be imitated, by laying sugar thus prepared on paper or pieces of thin boards near the roots of fruit-trees infested by insects, especially when the fruit is ripening? The papers or boards might be taken in during the night, or when it rained. The sugar should be coloured with indigo, or other substance, thereby to mark it as a substance to be avoided by curious idlers.\n",
      "We are informed that a person in Philadelphia employed brimstone in the following manner. Having cleared all round the roots of trees infested with caterpillars or other insects, he strewed some flowers of brimstone round the roots, and covered it with a thin sprinkling of fine mould, that it might not be blown away by the wind, yet so that the sun might operate through the mould, and cause the brimstone to fumigate. In this manner he destroyed the caterpillars. One pound he found sufficient for two∙hundred trees. In that hot climate the sun may perhaps have that effect; but it scarcely will in this. To drive insects from small trees, he also employed sulphur in the following manner. He split the end of a pole, and put in the slit some matches, set them on fire, and held them under the parts of the trees chiefly affected. A pole thus armed, he found, would answer for three or four trees. Brimstone mixed with damp straw, and set on fire, in hop-ground infested with the fly, for instance, might be of use in driving away that insect.\n",
      "The itch is supposed to originate from a very small insect which nestles under the skin, and proceeds no farther; and it is, therefore, attended with no dangerous consequences. Brimstone made into an ointment with hogs-lard is a sure remedy.\n",
      "Sheep are liable to an eruption on the skin, known by the name of the scab. Brimstone, when added to the mercurial ointment recommended for that disorder,^[3. Ibid. vol. vii. p. 90. ] might perhaps render the application more efficacious and less dangerous.\n",
      "The natives of hot countries are taught by experience, that an unctuous covering of their bodies prevents the bites of musquitos and all gnats. The white inhabitants in such countries are not sufficiently careful in preventing the least stagnant water near their dwellings, in which the musquitos are bred; they are produced even in the waste water thrown out. Dr Franklin, by a careful attention to this circumstance, guarded his family in Philadelphia from such insects. One day seeing a number of musquitos in his library, he found on inquiry, that one of his servants had taken off the cover of a tub placed near his window for receiving rain-water. On such an occasion the remedy is  easy, namely, shutting up the room for the day, so that the musquitos cannot come at any water, in which time they die. Though this caution may seem trifling to us who live in a mild climate, it is far otherwise in hot countries.\n",
      "Oil being known to be most efficacious in destroying insects, may not the use of it be extended to the destruction of worms in the bowels of horses, where they probably occasion the violent pain which these animals seem sometimes to suffer? If the horse were for some time kept fasting, and a large quantity of oil, say a pint, were given, supposing worms were the cause, the oil might in that case destroy them.\n",
      "Flowers, leaves, and fruits, are known to be devoured by caterpillars. But these are destroyed by oils, which close the lateral pores by which they breathe. For this purpose it is advised that, on the approach of spring, a cloth dipped in train oil be laid on those parts of the tree in which there is any appearance of them.\n",
      "We are informed in the Memoirs of the Society of Agriculture at Paris, that oil of turpentine, when applied to animals covered with insects, destroyed the insects without hurting the animal. The author tried it on several trees, mixed with fine earth so as to incorporate therewith, adding water, till the whole was brought to some degree of fluidity. In this mixture he dipped branches of fruit-trees on which there were insects, and thereby destroyed not only the eggs but also the insects, without hurting the leaves. This composition may be got off by washing, or the first heavy shower. From these experiments the author thinks, that oil of turpentine may with equal efficacy be employed for killing various kinds of lice on domestic animals.\n",
      "We are informed that Mr Winter, amongst other experiments on turnip-seed, steeped the seed twenty-four hours in a sufficient quantity of train-oil. He then drained the oil from the seed, which he mixed with a quantity of fine sifted earth, and immediately sowed it in drills. When the plants began to appear on the surface, the ground was sown with soot. He found that seed steeped in linseed oil answered equally well.^[4. Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, vol. v. p. 45. ] The turnips least injured by the fly, were those which grew from seed steeped in this way; they grew so luxuriantly as to produce rough leaves several days prior to the most flourishing of any of his other experiments, and were the better enabled to withstand the attack of the fly. The leaves of these turnips were of a darker green, and appeared twice as thick in bulk and luxuriancy as the other turnips, and were considerably larger. The seed was drilled an inch and a half deep, and a foot distant in the rows. Train oil is apt to kill the Ieaves of plants which have been injured by insects, but linseed oil has not that effect, though equally destructive to the insects. The train oil seems to act as an oil, and by its disagreeable smell to prevent insects approaching it. In this respect it may be successfully used to prevent field mice or other vermin preying on acorns, chestnuts, or other seeds steeped in it before they are sown.\n",
      "When thus giving directions for preventing the fly on turnips, an experiment may be mentioned, by the disclosure of which a person gained a considerable reward. His se- ' cret was, running a roller over the ground early in the morning, whilst the dew remained on the ground, on the first appearance of the fly. The dew entangled the flies so much, that they could not make their escape, and were therefore crushed to death. But as the roller may leave the surface of the earth too hard, it was recommended to fix some boughs of elder in a gate or hurdle, to be drawn over the field; and if the boughs had before been fumigated with the smoke of tobacco, or tincture of assafoetida, the success would be the surer. The most certain method of preventing the injury done by the fly is to raise the plants in a nursery, and at a proper age to transplant them, being carried to the ground in a wheel-barrow filled with manure softened with water so as to admit the plants. This method will secure their more speedy growth. In the nursery the attack of the fly may be prevented by sprinkling soot or quicklime on the ground. The utility of transplanting turnips is evident by the practice of transplanting the turnip-rooted cabbage. They who are discouraged from having recourse to this practice by the expense attending it, do not reflect that the hoeing is prevented, and the plants grow the better, being set in fresh earth.\n",
      "Before proceeding to direct the use of the last means mentioned, viz. tobacco, for destroying insects in turnips, it may be proper to mention an experiment made by Mr Green, of the flower-garden at Kew. He contrived a pair of bellows similar to that employed in recovering people apparently drowned. It had a cavity in the nozzle, in which some tobacco was put, with a live coal over it. The bellows being then wo\n",

      "the act of interring, that is, burying or laying a deceased person in the ground.\n",
      "Aristotle asserted that it was more just to assist the dead than the living. Plato, in his Republic, does not forget, amongst other acts of justice, that which concerns the dead. Cicero establishes three kinds of justice; the first respects the gods, the second the manes or dead, and the third men. These principles seem to be derived from nature; and they appear at least to be necessary for the support of society, since civilized nations have at all times taken care to bury their dead, and to pay the last respects to their remains.\n",
      "We find in history several traces of the respect which the Indians, the Egyptians, and the Syrians entertained for the dead. The Syrians embalmed their bodies with myrrh, aloes, honey, salt, wax, bitumen, and resinous gums; and they also dried them with the smoke of the fir and of the pine tree. The Egyptians preserved theirs with the resin of the cedar, with aromatic spices, and with asphaltum. These people often kept such mummies, or at least their effigies, in their houses; and at grand entertainments they were introduced, that by reciting the great actions of their ancestors they might be the more excited to virtue.\n",
      "The Greeks, at first, had probably not the same veneration for the dead as the Egyptians. Empedocles, therefore, in the eighty-fourth Olympiad, restored to life Pontifia, a woman of Agrigentum, who was about to be interred. But this people, in proportion as they became more enlightened, perceived the necessity of establishing laws for the protection of the dead. «\n",
      "At Athens the law required that no person should be interred before the third day; and in the greater part of the cities of Greece a funeral did not take place till the sixth or even the seventh day. When a man appeared to have breathed his last, his body was generally washed by ms nearest relations, with warm water mixed with wine. They afterwards anointed it with oil; and covered it with a dress commonly made of fine linen, according to the custom of the Egyptians. This dress was white at Messina, Athens, and in the greater part of the cities of Greece, where the dead body was crowned with flowers. At Sparta it was of a purple colour, and the body was surrounded with olive leaves. The corpse was afterwards laid upon a couch in the entry of the house, where it remained till the time of the funeral. At the magnificent obsequies with which Alexander honoured Hephaestion, the body was not burned until the tenth day.\n",
      "The Romans, in the infancy of their empire, paid as little attention to their dead as the Greeks had done. Acilius Aviola having fallen into a lethargic fit, was supposed to be dead; he was therefore carried to the funeral pile; the fire was lighted up; and though he cried out he was still alive, he perished for want of speedy assistance. The praetor Lamia met with the same fate. Tubero, who had been praetor, was saved from the funeral pile. Asclepiades, a physician, who lived in the time of Pompey the Great, about one hundred and twenty years before the Christian era, returning from his country-house, observed near the walls of Rome a grand convoy and a crowd of people, who were in mourning, assisting at a funeral, and showing every exterior sign oi the deepest grief. Having asked what was the occasion of this concourse, no one made any reply. He therefore approached the pretended dead body; and imagining that he perceived signs of life in it, he ordered the bystanders to take away the flambeaux, to extinguish the fire, and to pull down the funeral pile. On this a kind of murmur arose throughout the whole company. Some said that they ought to believe the physician, whilst others turned both him and his profession into ridicule. The relations, however, yielded at length to the remonstrances of Asclepiades; they consented to defer the obsequies for a little; and the consequence was that the pretended dead person was restored to life. It appears that these examples, and several others of a similar kind, Induced the Romans to delay funerals longer, and to enact laws to prevent precipitate nterments.\n",
      "At Rome, after allowing a sufficient time for mourning, the nearest relation generally closed the eyes of the deceased; and the body was bathed with warm water, either to render it fitter for being anointed with oil, or to re-animate the principle of life, which might remain suspended without*manifesting itself. Proofs were afterwards made to discover whether the person was really dead, and these were often repeated during the time that the body remained exposed; for there were persons appointed to visit the dead, and to prove their situation. On the second day, after the body had been washed a second time, it was anointed with oil and balm. Luxury increased to such a pitch in the choice of foreign perfumes for this purpose, that under the consulship of Licinius Crassus and Julius Caesar, the senate forbade any perfumes to be used except such as were the production of Italy. On the third day the body was clothed according to its dignity and condition. The robe called the praetexta was put upon magistrates, and a purple robe upon consuls. For conquerors who had merited triumphal honours, this robe was of gold tissue; for other Romans it was white, and for the lower classes of the people black. These dresses were often prepared at a distance, by the mothers and wives of persons still in life. On the fourth day the body was placed on a couch, and exposed in the vestibule of the house, with the visage turned towards the entrance, and the feet near the door; and in this situation it remained till the end of the week. Near the couch were lighted wax-tapers, a small box in which perfumes were burned, and a vessel full of water for purification, with which those who approached the body besprinkled themselves. An old man belonging to those who furnished every thing necessary for funerals sat near the deceased, with some domestics clothed in black. On the eighth day the funeral rites were performed; but, to prevent the body from corrupting before that time, salt, wax, the resinous gum of the cedar, myrrh, honey, balm, gypsum, lime, asphaltum or bitumen of Judaea, and several other substances, were employed. The body was carried to the pile with the face uncovered, unless wounds, or the nature of the disease, had rendered it loathsome and disgusting. In such a case a mask was used, made of a kind of plaster, which has given rise to the expression of funera larvata, used in some of the ancient authors. This was the last method of concealment which Nero made use of, after having caused Germanicus to be poisoned; for the effect of the poison had become very sensible, by livid spots, and the blackness of the body; but a shower of rain happening to fall, it washed the plaster entirely away, and thus the horrid crime of fratricide was discovered.\n",
      "In the primitive church the dead were washed and then anointed; the body was wrapped up in linen, or clothed in a dress of more or less value according to circumstances, and it was not interred until after being exposed and kept some days in the house. The custom of clothing the dead is in France observed only in the case of princes and ecclesiastics.\n",
      "Notwithstanding the customs above recited, still, in many places, and on numerous occasions in all places, too much precipitation attends this last office; or, if not precipitation, a neglect of due precautions in regard to the body.\n",
      "A man may fall into a syncope, and remain in that condition for a very considerable period of time. People in this situation have been known to come to life when deposited amongst the dead. A boy belonging to the hospital at Cassel appeared to have breathed his last; he was carried into the hall where the dead were exposed, and was wrapped up in a piece of canvass. Some time afterwards, recovering from his lethargy, he recollected the place in which he had been deposited, and crawling towards the door, knocked against it with his foot. This noise was luckily heard by the sentinel, who soon perceiving the motion of the canvass, called for assistance. The youth was immediately conveyed to a warm bed, and soon perfectly recovered. Had his body been confined by close bandages or ligatures, he would not have been able, in all probability, to make himself be heard; Kis unavailing efforts would have made him again fall into a syncope, and he would have thus been buried alive.\n",
      "We must not be astonished that the servants of an hospital should take a syncope for a real death, since even the most enlightened persons have sometimes fallen into errors of the same kind. Dr John Schmid relates, that a young girl, seven years of age, after being afflicted for some weeks with a violent cough, was all of a sudden freed from this troublesome malady, and appeared to be in perfect health. But some days afterwards, whilst playing with her companions, the child fell down in an instant, as if struck by lightning. A death-like paleness was diffused over her face and arms; she had no apparent pulse, her temples were sunk, and she showed no signs of sensation when shaken or pinched. A physician, who was called, and who believed her to be dead, in compliance with the repeated and pressing request of hcr parents, attempted, though without any hopes, to recall her to life; and at length, after several vain efforts, he made the soles of her feet be smartly rubbed with a brush dipped in very strong pickle. At the end of three quarters of an hour she was observed to sigh; she was then made to swallow some spirituous liquor; and she was soon afterwards restored to life, much to the joy of her disconsolate parents. A certain man having undertaken a journey in order to see his brother, on his arrival at his house found him dead. This news affected him so much that it brought on syncope, and he himself was supposed to be in the like situation. After the usua\n",

      "This extensive and interesting portion of Europe did not receive the name it has long borne till the extension of the Roman empire. The origin of that name has been derived by different persons from various sources. Timaeus and Varro have deduced it from a Greek word, Ιταλοί, which signifies an ox, because it contains a vast extent of pasture land, peculiarly adapted to that animal. Thucydides and Dionysius of Halicarnassus derive the name from a king Italus. In early periods it was sometimes called Saturnia, from the name of a deity, Saturn, in the heathen mythology. It was sometimes called (Eno-tria, from a Sabine chief named OEnotrius; and frequently Ausonia, from Auson, a son of Ulysses, who is said to have established a tribe in the centre of the peninsula. All of these more ancient names seem, however, to have referred only to particular districts, which, when the Roman power had subjected them all, assumed, with the other parts subsequently united to them, the general name it still continues to bear. The Greeks at all times applied to it the name Hesperia, on account of its being to the westward from their country; and the Teutones or Germans called it Waelschland, because the parts nearest to them were inhabited by a people called Galles, changed into Walles; and in their present language the name of Waelschland is still retained by the common people.\n",
      "The history of Italy before the rise of the Roman power is, like that of all rude nations, involved in obscurity, or clouded with indistinctness; through which the indefatigable Niebuhr, with a profusion of learning, has endeavoured to grope his way. Before Rome began to be powerful, Italy was peopled by inhabitants who had made some advances towards civilization. In the northern part the Gauls were rude and fierce, and they the longest resisted the encroaching power; whilst lower down, on the Arno and the Tiber, there was a number of smaller tribes, such as the Etruscans, the Samnites, and the Latins, who, in a kind of confederacy, though sometimes at variance with one another, long sought, and ultimately in vain, to defend their freedom against the rising and aspiring city. In the southern parts were colonies of emigrants from Greece, with but little union, and frequently engaged in hostilities amongst themselves. When and by what means all these tribes became finally subjected to Rome, belongs to the history of that empire; for the history of the conquered is swallowed up in that of the conquerors.\n",
      "The fate of Italy was that of Rome till the dissolution of that colossal power. When the seat of empire was removed to Constantinople, Italy, though accounted a portion of the western empire, was treated as a dependent province, and continued with only the semblance of power, which power was finally wrested from all dependence on Byzantium by an adventurous Gothic warrior, who, about the year 476 of the Christian era, founded the kingdom of Italy.\n",
      "Odoacer had raised himself, by his intrigues amongst the mercenary guards, to the command of those troops, who from inactivity had become restless and mutinous. Augustulus, the last emperor of the West, was unable to resist the power of his disaffected troops, and withdrew to Pavia. That city was besieged, captured, and ravaged, and Augustulus retired to obscurity, when Odoacer proclaimed himself king of Italy. He exercised the power with dignity, and, as regarded Augustulus, with clemency, by assigning him a liberal establishment, during the few years that remained of his life, in the retreat he had selected in Campania. Italy was in a wretched state, and Odoacer used as much prudence and humanity as could have been exercised by a rude conqueror, to improve the condition and the institutions of the country; but the licentious troops who had been the means of his obtaining it could not be kept in obedience by a power so created, and disorders became universal. When Odoacer had reigned fourteen years, Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, at the instigation of the Emperor Zeno, who reigned in Byzantium, invaded the newly-founded kingdom; defeated and assassinated Odoacer; and, in 493, added the whole of Italy to his dominions, which thus extended from the Alps to Sicily. The only part not subjected was some islands in the lagunes of the Adriatic Sea, inhabited by fishermen and salt-makers, who had first found a refuge in these from the ravages of Attila, and had there secured freedom, and by their union, and by the capability of defending themselves, laid the foundation of what subsequently became the republic of Venice. In the favoured climate of Italy, and under the government of Theodoric, the Goths multiplied rapidly; and they were almost the sole masters of the soil, and of the slaves who cultivated it. By his external policy he had acquired the confidence of the other Gothic tribes, even in the remote regions that border on the Baltic Sea, and had introduced strong and regular forms of government into Rhaetia, Noricum, Dalmatia, and Pannonia. Though the jealousy of the emperor at Byzantium induced him to invade the territory commanded by Theodoric, and to employ both a large fleet and a powerful army, his attempts were repelled by sea and by land, and his forces were dispersed or dispirited, and retired from the contest.\n",
      "Theodoric was not less successful in another attack from the west by King Clovis, the leader of the Franks, who were checked in the midst of a career which had commenced with brilliant success.\n",
      "Ravenna was the seat of the government of this prince, though he occasionally resided at Verona. He once visited Rome, where he was received with rapture by the populace, and with the highest marks of respect by the senators. During the latter and peaceful portion of his reign he endeavoured to amalgamate his Italian and Gothic subjects; but his success was much obstructed by the religious controversy between the orthodox and the Arians, though, whilst adhering to the latter sect, he tolerated and even honoured many of the other profession. But a union was in some measure effected between the conquerors and the conquered, and civilization was advanced during this long reign, although at the sacrifice of the manly simplicity of the former to the corruption and luxurious indulgences of the latter.\n",
      "Theodoric died in the palace he had built at Ravenna, in 526, after a reign of thirty-three years, having by his will divided his dominions between two grandsons, bequeathing Italy to Athalaric, then a boy of twelve years of age. The youthful sovereign was left under the pupillage of his mother Amalasontha, from which he was early withdrawn by the flatterers who surrounded him. His mother then entered into intrigues with the Emperor Justinian, tending to deliver up Italy to its ancient dependence on the court of Byzantium. Her son, as he advanced in age, entered on the most dissolute courses, by which his life was terminated in the sixteenth year of his age. His mother, who assumed the power, was speedily assassinated by a husband she had chosen to be a sharer of the throne.\n",
      "The imperial court was eager to take advantage of the unsettled state of Italy to reduce it again under subjection. Belisarius, the most renowned of the generals, was despatched, but with an inconsiderable force. Hostilities raged with great fury, and after a variety of changes in the aspect of affairs, the imperial commander had so weakened the Goths, and so engaged the confidence and assistance of the Italian inhabitants, that the prospect of complete subjugation presented itself. This was, however, clouded by the dissensions which broke out amongst the officers in command of the several divisions of the army of Justinian in 538. At that time the chief command was conferred on Narses, a eunuch, whose conduct at that period, whatever military merit he afterwards displayed, tended greatly to the injury of his sovereign’s party.\n",
      "Narses was indeed soon recalled, and Belisarius reinstated in the supreme command; but in the midst of discord the Goths had been permitted to breathe, an important season was lost, Milan had been destroyed, and the northern provinces of Italy were afflicted by an inundation of the Franks. Under Belisarius the events of the war underwent a favourable change; he captured the strongly fortified city of Ravenna, and returned with numerous captives to Constantinople to receive the applause of the people and a splendid triumph, the last reward of his valour and his humanity.\n",
      "The removal of Belisarius from Italy revived the spirits of the remaining Goths, and the feeble efforts of the successive generals of Justinian were insufficient to crush the civil war. The handful of the barbarians, scarcely amounting to five thousand, and in possession of no other strong place than Pavia, chose Totila for their chief, and proclaimed him king of Italy, in the year 54∣1.\n",
      "His progress was rapid, and almost without interruption, from the north of Italy to Naples. He captured that city, and returned to Rome, which he besieged; and though Belisarius, who had been recalled from the wars of Persia, attempted to relieve it, he was unable to do so; and the citizens, compelled by famine, allowed the Goths to occupy the capital of the western empire in the year 546. After an useless occupation of Rome when it had been abandoned by Totila, Belisarius was recalled to Constantinople, and the command once more conferred upon Narses, who was furnished with troops, stores, and money, with a profusion widely different from the parsimony exercised towards his predecessor. He advanced with his forces by the head of the Adriatic Sea, and in a tremendous battle encountered the Goths under Totila, whom he totally defeated, whilst that chief was killed in the conflict. After his death, those who had escaped elected Tejas as their king; but he too became the victim of his ambition, was soon subdued by Narses, and with him terminated, in 553, the Gothic kingdom \n",

      "one of the thirteen original states of the American union, is bounded on the north and northeast by New York, on the east and south-east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south-west by Delaware Bay, and on the west by Pennsylvania. The extreme length directly' from north to south is onc hundred and seventy miles, the mean breadth is about forty-six miles, and the whole state contains an area of 7820 square miles.\n",
      "The surface of the country presents every variety, but three marked divisions maybe particularised; first, a sandy or marine section; secondly, a hilly or middle section; and, thirdly, a mountainous section. The first occupies . nearly one half of the area of the state. A line from the mouth of Shrewsbury River to Bordentown will very nearly separate the alluvial from the hilly region. Between this limit and the continuation of the blue ridge, the state is beautifully variegated by rich and bold scenery. From the north to the south a succession of mountains, and lesser hills and heights, interspersed with plains, stretch out, each occupying a distinct and well-defined region. The mountainous portion of New Jersey is the extreme northern part of the state, composed of the counties of Warren and Sussex. The elevation of the different sections has not been very accurately determined, but the higher valleys of the latter county must be from 800 to 1000 feet above the level of the sea. The descent from the mountain to the hilly region is abrupt, as by the steps of a stair. A remarkable difference of temperature is experienced in the space of less than two and a half degrees of latitude. The alluvial plains of the southern section have a mild or rather tropical climate, resembling the eastern part of Virginia, and admit of the cultivation of cotton; whilst in the counties of Sussex and Warren it is more various, and, though salubrious enough, is in general less mild.\n",
      "The principal internal waters are Second River, Hackinsack, Passaic, Raritan, Musconetcong, Rancocus, Salem, Shrewsbury, Tom’s River, Great Eggharbor, Cohanzey, and Maurice River. None of these rivers are of any great length, though every part of the state abounds in rapid millstreams. A connexion, by means of a canal, between the Hudson and Delaware basins was completed in 1831, at an expense of about 2,000,000 of dollars. The line leaves the Delaware at Phillipsburgh, opposite Easton in Pennsylvania, and is carried over Warren county, New Jersey, ’ to its extreme north-cast angle, about thirty miles; thence eastward through Morris and Essex counties, to the Passaic River, and along the valley of the latter to Newark. From that city it proceeds across Passaic and Hackinsack, and winds through the Bergen Marshes to Jersey city, opposite New York. Inclined planes arc used on this canal instead of locks. During the year 1834 the Delaware and Raritan Rivers were connected by means of a canal from Brunswick to Bordentown, a distance of above thirty miles. This canal is calculated for sloop navigation; and has been constructed at an expense, with its feeder, of 2,500,000 dollars. The principal railroad is the Camden and Amboy, which unites the cities of New York and Philadelphia, crossing the state of New Jersey. It is sixty-one miles in length, and is connected with the Raritan and Delaware Canal. There is likewise a road from the manufacturing village of Patterson to New York, a distance of about sixteen miles; and another in progress (1835) from Jersey city, through Newark and Elizabethtown, to Brunswick.\n",
      "New Jersey abounds in staples, composed of every product of its fields, woods, mines, fisheries, and manufactories. Some parts of the state are not well adapted to cultivation, being either sandy and barren, or rocky and mountainous; but large portions have a soil of great fertility, well suited to the cultivation of grain, and fitted for grazing; and accordingly vast numbers of cattle are raised for the markets of New York and Philadelphia. Large quantities of butter and cheese, of superior quality, are made; and apples, peaches, and fruits of all kinds, are raised in abundance. The manufactories of Ncw Jersey are extensive and thriving. Iron is probably the most important. Bog ore is found in Burlington and Monmouth, and the mines of the northern counties are exceedingly rich. There are a number of forges and furnaces in active operation in several of the counties, and chain-cables are made at the town of Dover. The towns most engaged in manufactures are Newark and Patterson. The former is noted for the manufacture of leather, and the exercise of various occupations in which it is employed; also for the making of carriages, cabinet ware, and fancy chairs. Patterson is chiefly noted for its manufactures· of cotton, hemp, and machinery. Glass of various kinds, and in large quantities, is made in different counties; and paper and gunpowder are manufactured to some extent. This state is rich in mineral productions. Besides the iron already mentioned, which is abundant, limestone prevails extensively. Marble and zinc are found, and orcs of gold and silver have been discovered. Copper mines in Somerset and Bergen counties were wrought previously to the revolution, and extensive veins arc believed to cross the state in a south-westerly direction, from Schuyler mine, near Belleville, to the river Delaware. Marl, well adapted for manuring the arenaceous districts, is found in their vicinage. Clay of superior quality for the arts is obtained in great abundance near South Amboy; and sand, adapted for the manufacture of the finest glass, is found in the county of Cumberland, from which it is conveyed to the principal manufactories of the union.\n",
      "New Jersey is divided into fourteen counties, Bergen, Morris, Sussex, W^arren, Essex, Somerset, Henderson, Middlesex, Burlington, Mónmouth, Gloucester, Salem, Cumberland, and Cape May; and these are subdivided into townships. Trenton, the seat of government, is on the Delaware River, at the falls, on the great route between New York and Philadelphia, sixty miles south-west of the former, and thirty north-east of the latter. At the foot of the falls there is an elegant bridge over the Delaware, and that river is navigable for sloops and steam-boats to this place. The latter ply regularly between Trenton and Philadelphia. It is a handsome town, and contains a number of public buildings, amongst which the most conspicuous is the state-house. Trenton contains several respectable manufactories; and, in 1830, the population amounted to 3925. Newark is pleasantly situated on the western bank of the Passaic River, a fcw miles from its mouth. This is the handsomest town in the state, and contains several public buildings and religious edifices, together with extensive manufactories of different kinds. In this and the adjoining town of Orange there are valuable quarries of stone for building, and numerous tanneries. The population in 1830 amounted to 10,953. New Brunswick is situated on the western bank of the Raritan, thirty-three miles south-west of New York; and steam-boats regularly ply between the two cities. The buildings of New Brunswick, which has a city incorporation, arc thinly distributed over a considerable extent of ground. Besides several public buildings and churches, there is a college and theological seminary. The former was established by the ministers of the Dutch reformed church, for the education of their clergy, and incorporated in 1770. The exercises, which were suspended for several years, were revived ' in 1825, under very favourable auspices. The theological seminary was established in the city in 1810, by the general synod of the Dutch reformed churches, and is to a certain extent connected with the college. In 1830, the population of New Brunswick amounted to 7831, half of whom are of Dutch extraction. Princeton is a pleasant village, eleven miles north-east of Trenton, and sixteen south-west of Brunswick. Here is the college of New Jersey, founded in 1738, and which has always been one of the most respectable and flourishing literary institutions in the country. The college edifice is designated Nassau Hall, and it contains a chapel, with sixty rooms for students. There are also buildings for the library, philosophical apparatus, museum, and other purposes. There are ten instructors, and above one hundred students. There is also a theological seminary at Princeton, connected with which are two professors, one of didactic and polemic theology, and another of ecclesiastical history. The edifice for the accommodation of the institution is an elegant stone building, containing rooms for one hundred students. Elizabethtown is pleasantly situated on Elizabethtown Creek, which empties itself into Staten Island Sound. Vessels of twenty or thirty tons come up to the town, and those of two or three hundred tons to within two miles of the town. A steam-boat plies between the city of New York and Elizabethtown Point. Patterson is situated on the Passaic, near the great falls, in a position much admired for the romantic scenery which surrounds it. It is the chief manufacturing town in the state, and in 1830 contained a population of 7731. The other towns are not of sufficient importance to demand individual description. They have all, according to their size, the usual number of public edifices and of religious houses.\n",
      "Great attention to the cause of public education has recently been evinced throughout this state, and measures adopted which promise important results to the cause of universal enlightenment. Previously to the inquiry which was instituted in 1828, the system of instruction was very defective; but efforts have since been made to change this state of things. A school fund, exceeding 250,000 dollars, is managed by trustees under the authority of the legislature, and is steadily increasing; whilst a large portion of its annual income is distributed amongst the several townships, and is applied, augmen\n",

      "a considerable commercial town, the port of Mecca, situated on the eastern shore of the Red Sea. It is built on a slightly rising ground, the lowest side of which is washed by the sea, and extends along the shore, in its greatest length, about 1500 paces, and is about half that space in breadth. It was encompassed with a wall in 154-0; but as this ancient defence has long since fallen into a state of ruin, a new wall has been constructed on the land side, by the joint labours of the inhabitants, to guard against the incursions of the Wahabees. It is in a tolerable state of repair, but is of no strength; though it is a sufficient barrier against the Arabs, who have no artillery. W’atch-towers, with a few rusty guns, are erected at the distance of forty or fifty paces; a narrow ditch is carried round it to increase the means of defence; and it enjoys throughout Arabia the reputation of an impregnable fortress. At the northern extremity stands the governor’s residence; and on the southern is a small castle, mounting eight or ten guns. The whole harbour is commanded by a battery, in which is mounted an immense old piece of ordnance, which carries a ball of 500 pounds, and, says Burckhardt, ii is so celebrated all over the Red Sea, that the very fame of it is a protection to the port.” The approach to the town by the sea is by two quays, where small boats discharge the cargoes of large ships; these last being obliged to anchor in the roadstead, about two miles from the shore. The quays being shut every evening after sun-set, all communication is prevented at night between the town and the shipping. On the land-side Jidda has two gates, the Bab-Mekka on the east side, and the Bab-el-Medina on the north. Along the area enclosed by the modern wall, and by the sea on the west, a broad piece of open ground extends the whole length of the interior wall; there is also a good deal of waste ground near the Medina gate, and on the southern extremity. The suburbs consist of miserable huts of reeds, rushes, and brushwood, inhabited by Bedouins or poor peasants and labourers, who live after the Arab fashion. The most respectable inhabitants reside near the sea, where there is a long street parallel with the shore, lined with shops, and containing many khans, exclusively frequented by merchants. Jidda is well built; the streets, though unpaved, are spacious and airy; and the houses are high, consisting mostly of two stories, with many small windows and wooden shutters, and wholly constructed of stone, mostly brought from the sea-shore, but consisting of madrepores and other marine fossils. They have generally a spacious hall at the entrance, where, at noon, the master, with all his male attendants and slaves, may be seen enjoying a siesta. No attention is paid to uniformity of architecture. Some houses are built with small, others with large square stones; sometimes the walls are entirely of stone, whilst at other times layers of plank arc placed at intervals in the wall. When the walls are plastered, the dazzling white, during the glare of the sun, is extremely distressing to the eye. There are no buildings of ancient date, owing to the rapid decay of the madrepore, of which they are constructed, when it is exposed to the rain and the moist atmosphere prevalent on the shores of the Red Sea. The town contains, besides many small mosques, two of considerable size. The governor’s habitation is a paltry building, as also that of the collector of the customs. The khans are, many of them, well built, and have good accommodation for the foreign merchants, whose residence they are during their short stay in the town. Water is scarce in Jidda, as in most of the Arabian towns. Several of the wells are private property, and yield their owners a considerable income. Every town of moderate size has its cisterns; but the rains not falling in sufficient abundance to afford an adequate supply to the town, the inhabitants are forced to have recourse to pools formed outside of the town in the rainy season. This water is not so good as the rain-water, which is esteemed a delicacy; and though water is everywhere found at the depth of fifteen feet, it is of a bad quality, and scarcely fit for use. There are only two wells that afford sweet water, which is wholly consumed by the rich. The poorer classes use the water supplied by the other wells, to which, being of indifferent quality, their ill health is ascribed. The town of Jidda is surrounded by a barren desert, without gardens or vegetation of any kind, except a few date-trees adjoining one of the mosques, or a few shrubs and low acacia trees. Beyond the Mecca wall; and on the road to this place, are huts inhabited by poor Bedouins, camel-drivers, and negro hadjis or pilgrims, who gain a livelihood by cutting wood in the mountains. About a mile beyond these huts, eastward of the town, is the principal burial-ground, containing the tombs of several sheiks. There are also several cemeteries within the walls.\n",
      "The inhabitants of Jidda, like those of Mecca and Medina, are almost exclusively foreigners, and consist, in many cases, of rich merchants, who come on their pilgrimage to Mecca with large adventures of goods, and, not being able to settle their accounts immediately, they wait another year. In the mean time, cohabiting with Abyssinian slaves, whom they marry, and finding themselves with a family, they at last settle in the country. Every pilgrimage thus adds to the population of Jidda, as of the other Arabian towns, and recruits the waste occasioned by the surplus of the deaths over the births. The natives of Jidda are only a few families of Shcrifs, who are all of the learned order, and are attached to the mosques or the.courts of justice. All the others are foreigners, or their descendants. Colonies from every town and province of Hadramaut and Yemen are settled in Jidda, and maintain an intercourse with their native places. There are upwards of a hundred Indian families from Surat, and a few from Bombay; also Malays, and people from Muskat. The settlers from Egypt, Syria, Barbary, European Turkey, and Anatolia, may be still recognised in tbe features of their descendants. No Christians are settled in Jidda; but a few Greeks from the islands of the archipelago occasionally bring merchandise to this market from Egypt. Jews were formerly the chief brokers of the town, but they were all expelled about fifty or sixty years ago by some of the governors.\n",
      "Jidda is a great emporium of maritime commerce, and well merits the Arabian appellation of Djidda, or rich, being probably richer than any town of the same size in the Turkish dominions. The inhabitants are mostly all engaged in commerce, and pursue no manufactures or trades but those of immediate necessity. They are all either sea-faring people, traders by sea, or engaged in trading with Arabia. Jidda not only derives its riches from being the port of Mecca, through which numerous bands of pilgrims pass in their journey to the holy place, but it is an entrepôt of eastern commerce, through which all the exports of India and Arabia destined for Egypt first pass. All bargains are chiefly for ready money, the bad faith of the eastern merchants not being favourable to credit. Sales and purchases are made of entire ships’ cargoes in the course of half an hour, and the next day the money is paid down. Its commerce may be divided into two principal branches, namely, the coffee trade and the Indian trade. Ships laden with coffee arrive from Yemen all the year round, and dispose of their cargoes for cloths, linen stuffs, and beads, but chiefly for dollars, which they take back to their own country. The demand for Arabian coffee in European Turkey, Asia Minor, and Syria, has been in a great degree superseded, since the termination of the war in Europe, by West India coffee.\n",
      "The fleets from India, from Calcutta, Surat, and Bombay, reach Jidda in the beginning of May; their cargoes of Indian goods are immediately bought up by the merchants of Jidda, or on account of Cairo merchants, who send money to Jidda for the purpose. The greater part of the merchandise is shipped for Suez, and sold at Cairo, whence it finds its way into the Mediterranean. The returns are made either in goods or in dollars and sequins, large quantities of which are carried off annually by the Indian fleet. There are several rich merchants in Jidda. Burckhardt, on whose accurate information this account is chiefly founded, mentions two merchants whose grandfathers were the original settlers, and who had each a capital of from L.150,000 to L.250,000. Several Indians, he adds, had acquired capitals nearly equal; and there were about a dozen of houses possessing from L.40,000 to L.50,000 sterling. The vessels belonging to Jidda amount to about 250. It trades by land only with Mecca and Medina. A caravan, of from sixty to a hundred camels, departs for Medina every forty or fifty days, principally with India goods and drugs, and is always augmented by a crowd of pilgrims, who wish to visit Mahommed’s tomb. There is another caravan for Mecca every evening, or at least twice a week, with goods and provisions. During the pilgrimage these caravans set out regularly every evening after sun-set from the Mecca gate; also a caravan of asses, which perform the journey in fifteen or sixteen hours. It is by this caravan that letters are conveyed between the two towns. There are twenty-seven coffee-shops in Jidda, where coffee, as in most parts of Arabia, is drunk to excess, and various other shops for the sale of butter, which is a chief article of Arabian cookery; honey, oil, vinegar, fruits, dates, beans, &c.; sweet-meats, sugar-plums, bread, milk; corn, consisting of Egyptian wheat, beans, lentils, dhourra, Indian and Egyptian rice; biscuits, salt, tobacco, soap, drugs, spices, sugar, perfumery, incense, &c. There are also shops for articles of Indian manufacture, for the sale of clothes chiefly afte\n",

      "The juices of several plants are expressed to obtain their essential salts, and for several medicinal purposes, with intention either to be used without further preparation, or to be made into syrups and extracts. The general method of extracting these juices is, by pounding the plant in a marble mortar, and then by putting it into a press. In this way is obtained a muddy and green liquor, which generally requires to be clarified. The juices of all plants are not extracted with equal case. Some plants, even when fresh, contain so little juice, that water must be added whilst they are pounded, otherwise scarcely any juice could be obtained by expression. Other plants, which contain a considerable quantity of juice, furnish by expression but a small quantity of it, because they contain also much mucilage, which renders the juice so viscid that it cannot flow. Water must also be added to these plants to obtain their juice. The juices thus obtained from vegetables by a mechanical method arc not, properly speaking, one of their principles, but rather a collection of all the proximate principles of plants which are soluble in water; such is the saponaceous extractive matter, the mucilage, the odoriferous principle, and the saline and saccharine substances; all of which are dissolved in the water of the vegetation of the plants. Besides these matters, the juice contains some part of the resinous substance, and the green colouring matter, which in almost all vegetables is of a resinous nature. These two latter substances not being soluble in water, are only interposed between the parts of the other principles which are dissolved in the juice, and consequently disturb its transparency. They nevertheless adhere together in a certain degree, and so strongly in most juices, that they cannot be separated by filtration alone. When therefore these juices are to be clarified, some previous preparations must be used by which the filtration may be facilitated. Juices which arc acid, and not very mucilaginous, are spontaneously clarified by rest and gentle heat. The juices of most antiscorbutic plants abounding in saline volatile principles, may be disposed to filtration merely by immersion in boiling water; and as they may be contained in close bottles, whilst they are thus heated in a water bath, their saline volatile part, in which their medicinal qualities chiefly consist, may thus be preserved. Fermentation is also an effectual method of clarifying juices which are susceptible of it; for all liquors which have fermented clarify spontaneously after fermentation. But this method is not used to clarify juices, because many of them are susceptible of only an imperfect fermentation, and because the qualities of most of them are injured by that process. The method of clarification most generally used, and indispensably necessary for those juices which contain much mucilage, is boiling with the white of an egg. This matter, which has the property of coagulating in boiling water, and of uniting with mucilage, does accordingly, when added to the juice of plants, unite with and coagulate their mucilage, and separates it from the juice in form of scum, together with-the greatest part of the resinous and earthy matters which disturb its transparency. And as any of these resinous matters which may remain in the liquor, after this boiling with the whites of eggs, are no longer retained by the mucilage, they may be easily separated by filtration.\n",
      "The juices, especially before they are clarified, contain almost all the same principles as the plant itself; because, in the operation by which they are extracted, no decomposition happens, but every thing remains, as to its nature, in the same state as in the plant. The principles contained in the juice are only separated from the grosser oily, earthy, and resinous parts, which compose the solid matter that remains under the press. These juices, when well prepared, have therefore the same medicinal qualities as the plants from which they are obtained. They must evidently differ from each other as to the nature and proportions of the principles with which they are impregnated, as much as the plants from which they are extracted differ from each other in those respects.\n",
      "Most vegetable juices coagulate when they are exposed to the air, whether they are drawn out of the plant by wounds, or naturally run out; though what is called naturally running out is generally the effect of a wound in the plant, from a sort of canker, or some other internal cause. Different parts of the same plant yield different juices. The same veins, in their course through the different parts of the plant, yield juices of a different appearance. Thus the juice in the root of the cow-parsnip is of a brimstone colour, but in the stalk it is white.\n",
      "Amongst those juices of vegetables which are clammy and readily coagulate, there are some which readily break with a whey. The great wild lettuce, with the smell of opium, yields the greatest plenty of milky juice of any known British plant. When the stalk is wounded with a knife, the juice flows out readily like a thick cream, and is white and ropy; but if these wounds are made at the top of the stalks, the juice that flows out of them is dashed with a purple tinge, as if cream had been sprinkled over with a fcw drops of red wine. Some little time after letting this out, it becomes much more purple, and thickens; and finally, the thicker part of it separates, and the thin whey swims at the top. The whey or thin part of this separated matter is easily pressed out from the curd by squeezing between the fingers, and the curd will then remain white; and on washing with water it becomes like rags. The purple whey (for in this is contained all the colour) soon dries into a purple cake, and may be crumbled between the fingers into a powder of the same colour. The white curd being dried and kept for some time, becomes bard and brittle. It breaks with a shining surface like resin, and is inflammable, taking fire at a candle, and burning all away with a strong flame. The same thick part being held over a gentle heat, will draw out into tough, long threads, melting like wax. The purple cake made from the whey is quite different from this; and when held to a candle scarce flames at all, but burns to a black coal. The whole virtue of the plant seems also to consist in this thin part of its juice; for the coagulum or curd, though looking like wax or resin, has no taste at all; whereas the purple cake made from the serum is extremely bitter, and of a taste somewhat resembling that of opium.\n",
      "Of the same kind with the wild lettuce arc the throatwort, spurge, and many other plants. These are all replete with a milky juice which separates into curds and whey like that already described. But this, though a common law of nature, is not universal; for there are many plants which yield the like milky juices without any separation ensuing upon their extravasation. The white juice of the sonchus never separates, but dries into an uniform cake; the common red wild poppy bleeds freely with a milky juice; and the heads or capsules of seed bleed not less freely than the rest of the plant, even after the flower is fallen. The juice, on being received into a shell or other small vessel, soon changes its white to a deep yellow colour, and dries into a cake which seems resinous and oily, but no whey separates from it. The tragopogon, or goat’s beard, when wounded, exudes freely a milky juice; it is at first white, but becomes immediately yellow, and then more and more red, till at length it is wholly of a dusky red. It never separates, but dries together into one cake; and is oily and resinous, but of an insipid taste. The great bindweed also exudes freely a white juice; the flowers, as well as the stalks and leaves, affording this liquor. It is of a sharp taste; and, as many of the purging plants are of this class, it would be worth trying whether this milk is not purgative.\n",
      "These juices, as well as the generality of others which bleed from plants, are white like milk; but there are some of other colours. The juice of the great celandine is of a fine yellow colour; it flows from the plant of the thickness of cream, and soon dries into a bard cake, without any whey separating from it. Another yellow juice is yielded by the seed-vessels of the yellow centaury in the month of July, when the seeds are full grown. This is very clammy; it soon hardens altogether into a cake without any whey separating from it. It sticks to the fingers like bird-lime, is of the colour of pale amber, and will never become harder than soft wax if dried in the shade; but if laid in the sun it immediately becomes hard like resin. These cakes burn like wax, and emit a very pleasant smell. The great angelica also yields a yellowish juicc on being wounded; and this will not harden at all, but if kept several years will still be soft and clammy, drawing out into threads or half-melted resin.\n",
      "Other kinds of juices very different from all these are those of a gummy nature. Some of these remain liquid a long time, and are not to be dried without the assistance of heat; and others very quickly harden of themselves, and are not inflammable. The gum of the juice of rhubarb leaves soon hardens, and is afterwards soluble in commonwater, and sparkles when put into the flame of a candle. The clusters of the common honeysuckle are full of a liquid gum. This they frequently throw out, and it falls upon the leaves, where it retains its own form. The red hairs of the ros solis are all terminated by large bladders of a thin, watery fluid. This is also a liquid gum; it sticks to the fingers, draws out into long threads, and stands the force of the sun all day. In the centre of each of these dew-drops there is a small red bladder, which stands immediately on the summit of the red hair, and contains a pu\n",

      "a territory extending along the eastern shores of South Africa, from the eastern boundary line of the Cape of Good Hope to Delagoa Bay, a distance of between 600 and 700 miles. It extends inwards to the country of the Boshuanas, between 200 and 300 miles from the sea; but this frontier has never been properly explored, and consequently cannot be correctly defined. To this coast the Portuguese gave the name of Natal, which has been followed by navigators, but is of course not in use amongst the natives as a designation of their territory. Of this region of the globe, either as regards its physical aspect or natural productions, little is known, and that little is confined to isolated parts, and not to the country as a whole. In some portionsof itsandy plainsspread out in unfruitful barrenness for many miles; but others are exceedingly fertile, consisting of fine savannahs, intersected with small clumps of trees, and carpeted with a rich variety of herbaceous plants, whilst excellent streamlets, meandering amongst the shrubbery in the centre of the valleys, give life and beauty to the landscape. These are chiefly to be met with at the base of a chain of high mountains stretching into the vicinity of Delagoa Bay. The ridge was recently crossed by one of the missionaries resident in this quarter, who says, that on reaching the summit, fine grassy plains, thickly inhabited, were seen spreadingout in every direction, it being the summer residence and grazing-place of those clans who live along the base of the mountain. The pasturage was good and abundant, the climate remarkably fine, and the general aspect of the country, the trees, and shrubs, and other features, strikingly resembled those in many parts of England, whilst the whole appeared watered by numerous rills. The mountainous range which divides the sea-border from the interior is in some parts 6000 feet in height; and the most distinguishing geological feature which they possess is the presence of a superincumbent stratum of sandstone. High detached masses are found in many places standing some feet above the surface of the earth. The upper part of a mountain visited by the individual alluded to, presented to the eye immense precipices capped with large rhomboidal tables, and projecting angles forming a sort of cornice to the face. On the side of the declivities there was a description of prismatic quartz crystals in a corroded state, and evidently undergoing the process of decomposition; a circumstance which is observable in all the mountains of South Africa, and will no doubt yearly give rise to an increasing extent of soil. Iron-stone is everywhere found in Kaffraria, and also considerable quantities of ochre of various kinds, presenting itself under different circumstances. The coast of Natal has been described by one of the most recent authorities as looking like a large park, varied with hill and dale, displaying occasionally through a luxuriant valley the distant prospect of blue mountainous ridges. On other parts of the coast the landscape was equally beautiful; clusters of trees, hills, vales, and glens composing the foreground, whilst in the distance, divided by a deep valley or chasm, a range of craggy mountains extended in a parallel direction to the limits of vision. There are a great many rivers on the Kaffraria coast, of which the Kai or Ky, and Keiskamma, are amongst the largest. The entrance of the former is one of the most picturesque and extraordinary in the world, as it forms, by its abrupt and perpendicular heights, a natural lock, “wanting only a flood-gate to make it a wet dock.” That part of the coast where Port Natal is situated possesses so many advantages, that proposals have been lately made to the British government to have it regularly settled. The memorial of the merchants and other inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope embodies various reasons for laying the case before the “king in council and as it likewise conveys a description of the country, we shall give an abstract from it.\n",
      "The arguments brought forward are, that the country in the vicinity of Port Natal was originally purchased by the Dutch, and held by them as a dependency of the Cape of Good Hope, and, of course, along with the latter colony, was ceded to Great Britain in 1814; that since the year 1824, Port Natal has been almost constantly occupied by British subjects, by permission of the governor of Cape Colony; that these persons had succeeded in opening a trade with the natives, which has gradually increased in extent, from the encouragement offered by the Zoolas, who are favourable to Europeans, but whose residence there is attended with great risk in the absence of a government establishment, which would be a protection to the trader, and likewise prevent the frequent collision of the Zoola and Kaffre tribes. The pastures of the country between these tribes are of a highly favourable description. It is well wooded with large timber, and watered by upwards of one hundred rivers and running streams, some of which are larger than the chief rivers of Cape Colony. The soil is fertile, and has produced three crops of Kaffre and Indian corn in the year. The rains are periodical, and the climate is cooler than that of the Cape, and highly salubrious. The bay of Port Natal is an exceedingly fine harbour, but the entrance is narrow, and has a bar of shifting sand. There are six feet of water on the bar, with a run of six feet, and at spring-tides the depth is fourteen. “There are a considerable number of natives, a laborious and well-conducted people, who are the remains of the tribes who formerly occupied the country purchased and ceded by the Dutch, and who, having attached themselves to the white inhabitants, are living in its vicinity under their auspices, unmolested by the Zoolas.” The memorial goes on to state, that such an establishment as that contemplated would prevent the irregular trading which is carried on at Port Natal, and advance the civilization and moral improvement of the neighbouring tribes, besides protecting the Kaffŕes. The ceded territory is said to extend about two hundred miles along the coast to the westward, and one hundred miles inland; and, from the capabilities of the country for maintaining a large population, and carrying on an extensive trade, a comparatively small military force is ail that is required.\n",
      "The name Kaífre (in Arabic Kafir, signifying an unbeliever or pagan) was given by the early Portuguese navigators to the natives of the entire eastern coast of Africa. The Dutch settlers at the Cape, therefore, when, in their migrations eastward, they discovered a race of men entirely different from the Hottentots, called them Kaffres. This name, in its most extensive application, designates several African tribes, who are again distinguished by other appellations; and colonial usage has almost appropriated the generic term Kaffrc to the tribe in closest contact with the colony, and who call themselves Amakósa. Their northern neighbours are called the Amatêmbu, which the Dutch have metamorphosed into Tembooger, and the English into Tam-bookies. Farther east is located the Amaponda or Amambo, which has been corrupted into Mambookies. The latter are the most industrious of the three nations, but the Amakósa arc considered the most warlike. Still farther to the east of the Amaponda are the Zoolas, to whom reference has already been made. The descent of these races of men has been attributed to the Bedouins or wandering Arabs; and this conjecture is by no means improbable, for they are distinct from both negroes and Hottentots; whilst the people above mentioned, having penetrated into every part of Southern Africa, may have reached this country by skirting the Red Sea, and journeying southward by the sea-coast, so as to avoid the great desert of sand by which Africa is divided into two parts. Their character, manners, modes of building, and other circumstances, also favour the assumption. The middle of the seventeenth century has been assumed as the period when they first acquired territory here from the native tribes. The Amakósa Kaffres have been frequently described by individuals who have visited their country. Their features are Asiatic, their physical endowments considerable, and their intellectual qualities respectable, although, from their remaining still in an uncivilized, and almost entirely savage state, the latter have not had a fair opportunity of developing themselves. But we shall recur to the subject of their character and future prospects at the close of this article.\n",
      "One of the principal articles of trade amongst the Kaffres is the barter of cattle for young women of the Tam-bookie tribe, who are short, Stoutland muscular; and these are preferred by the chiefs to females of their own people. In the warm season a thin apron constitutes their sole bodily attire; but in winter a cloak is used, made of the skins of wild beasts, admirably curried. The head, even in the hottest weather, is never protected by any covering; and they seldom use shoes, except on undertaking a long journey, when they condescend to wear a rude substitute for them. The bodies of both sexes are tatooed; and those of the young men who correspond to the fops of more civilized nations paint their skins and curl their hair. Their arms are the javelin, a large shield of buffalo hide, and a short club. The women exhibit taste in the arrangement of their dress, particularly for the head, which consists of a turban made of skin, and profusely ornamented with beads. A mantle of skin, variously bedecked with beads and other showy trinkets, is worn; and the only distinction between the dress of the chieftain’s wives and those of the lower ranks consists in the greater profusion of ornaments possessed by the former, but of which all are alike vain. There is no change, the whole wardrobe of the female being that which she carries about with her, and sleeps in; for \n",

      "----\n",
      "a district of Northern Hindustan, which was formerly a Hindu principality, conterminous with that of Dution the east, the boundary line being the Cali River. On the west it was separated from Gurwal by the Ramgunga, and extended a considerable way into the plains of Bareilly. The modern district of Kemaon, as it has been regulated by the British since its conquest in 1815, comprehends the whole tract of country between the Ganges and the Cali, from the plains to the highest pinnacle of the Himalaya, which space includes a large portion of the Gurwal province south-east of Alcananda, whilst the Cali River on the east forms a natural and well-defined boundary towards Nepaul. The other geographical divisions are Kemaon proper, Pain-khandi, and Bhutant, within the limits of which last is the pass of Niti, supposed to have been the earliest and most frequented route into Chinese Tartary. It includes an area of 7000 square miles.\n",
      "Kemaon is situated amongst the lower ranges of the Himalaya Mountains. It is separated from the lower districts of Bareilly 'and Morabad by a thick forest of nearly two days’journey, which surrounds the whole and skirts the margin of the mountains. The soil is marshy, and the atmosphere, during two thirds of the year, is more pestilential than that of the Sunderbunds; it is, says Heber,^[1. Vol. ii. p. 143. ] “a literal belt of death, which even the natives tremble to go near, and which, during the rains more especially, the monkies are forced to abandon. After the middle of November this is dry, practicable, and safe.” Kemaon proper is separated on the north-east from the province of Gurwal by a range of mountains, which, in point of ruggedness, presents a contrast to the hills of Kemaon. These latter appear to rise in a regular gentle acclivity from their bases; and the soil is fertile, consisting of rich earth, which gives nourishment to fine verdure and extensive forests. The hills are also intersected by rather spacious valleys, rendered fertile by tillage; and the cultivation is more extended, and carried farther up the hills, than in Gurwal with a denser population. In these valleys, rice is produced in abundance, and the cultivator is thus in a manner rendered independent of the seasons, as the numerous mountain streams, descending in ever}' direction, enable him to irrigate all the lower lands. The higher lands produce wheat, barley, and various small grains, which being raised in a redundant quantity, form an article of traffic with Bhutant. There are several passes into Kemaon from the districts of Bareilly and Morabad, but those leading through Cossipoor and Roderpoor are considered as the best, and are most frequented. The first leads by Chilkeah, where an annual k fair is held, to which the hill people resort in great numbers. Similar meetings also occur at Bhagesur, on the banks of the Cali, each continuing ten days, and are frequented by merchants from Bhote and the low countries. Chilkeah is one of the principal marts of trade in Kemaon, and through that country into Thibet and Tartary. The article which meets with the readiest sale is cloth with distinct colours on each side. European articles, of a coarse quality, are also in demand, such as knives, razors, wine-glasses, tumblers, spying and looking glasses, spectacles, and cheap enamelled watches; and Bishop Heber also saw exposed to sale English cloths, and eastern shawls of good appearance, with many other serviceable and valuable commodities. The greatest staple that is exported from this southern frontier has always been timber, found in the immense forests already mentioned, which skirt the border. Here the saul forests are of great extent, and produce some of the best timber of that species in India. Owing to the difficulty of access, it is necessary to convert the trees into planks on the spot, that they may be the more easily transported to the populous parts of the country. In some parts they have to be carried down a perpendicular height of 500 feet. The fir-tree grows to an immense size, and it is much stronger than the firs of Europe, and as heavy as teak, the grain strong and full of turpentine. Some of the trees have from sixty to seventy feet clear of branches, and the spans are from twenty to twenty-three inches in diameter. Rosin, turpentine, doedwar, oil, and hemp of an excellent quality, are to be found among the Kemaon Hills. The bamboo, though small, grows remarkably tough, and seems to gain consistency and soundness from a certain degree of frost. The same is said to be the case with the plantains. The tea-plant grows wild all through Kemaon, but cannot be made use of, from an emetic quality which it possesses. The upper mountains produce copper, lead, iron, and the Panar River gold, but there is no mine of consequence. The northern parts are cold, and yield pasture for numerous flocks of sheep; and in summer a considerable intercourse is carried on with the country subject to China.\n",
      "The towns and villages of Kemaon, when viewed from a distance, present a neat appearance. But a nearer approach does not confirm these favourable prepossessions. They are generally surrounded by dirt and filth; though Bishop Heber mentions, that the town of Almorah is very neat, with a natural pavement of slaty rock, which is kept beautifully clean. He mentions, however, of the peasantry, namely, the Khasyas, that, near Almorah, though they are honest, peaceable, and cheerful, they are dirty to a degree which he never saw amongst the Hindus, and extremely averse to any improvement, using their women ill, and employing them in the most laborious tasks. These people are rigid Hindus. The houses are generally constructed of large masses of stone, roofed with slate, and of two stories in height, the lower story being allotted to cattle. Their poverty is extreme, their food consisting of coarse cakes made from the grain of a kind of holcus, in which the flour, bran, and husk, are mixed together, and baked, or rather scorched, on the fire. In other parts, however, as he advanced farther among the hills, Bishop Heber saw tolerably neat and comfortable cottages, the people better fed and clothed than most of the Khasyas. Polygamy is common among the lower classes.\n",
      "Wild animals abound in the mountains and forests of this country. The tiger is found quite, up to the glaciers, of size and ferocity undiminished. There are also lynxes, and bears are common and mischievous throughout the province. Though they do not, except when pressed by hunger, eat flesh, preferring roots, berries, and honey, yet, as if out of capricious cruelty, they often worry and destroy passengers. The chamois is not uncommon in the snowy mountains, but scarce elsewhere; and the hares are much finer and larger than those in Hindustan, and not much inferior to those of Europe. The musk-deer is also found in the highest and coldest parts of the province, and the neighbouring countries of Thibet and Tartary. It cannot, says Heber, even bear the heat at Almorah. In like manner, the yak or mountain ox of Tartary droops as soon as it leaves the neighbourhood of the ice. The shawl-goat will live, but its wool degenerates. On the other hand, English dogs, impaired by the elimate of the plains, improve in strength, size, and sagacity, amongst the mountains; and it is remarkable that, in a winter or two, they acquire tlιe same fine short shawl-wool, mixed with their own hair, which distinguishes the indigenous animal of the country. The same is in some degree the case with horses. Flying squirrels are also common amongst the colder and higher parts of these woods. Some of the marmots, of the alpine kind, also abound in the neighbourhood of the snow. A singular species of wild dog is mentioned as a native of these hills. In form and fur these animals resemble a fox, but they are much larger. They hunt in packs, give tongue like dogs, and possess a very fine scent. They make great havoek of the game amongst the hills, and even attack and destroy the tiger, overpowering him by their numbers. Of birds, the condor is to be found of a remarkable strength and size. Eagles are numerous, and very large and formidable; and these birds do much injury to the shepherds and goatherds, and sometimes carry away the poor naked children of the peasants. Their nests being in the remote glaciers, and among inaccessible crags, there is no possibility of destroying these dangerous animals. There are larks in Kemaon, not very different from the English, as well as quails, partridges, pheasants, thrushes, &e. A little bird resembling the robin, and the goldfinch, are found at the foot of the snowy mountains.^[2. Heber, Narrative of a Journey through the Upper Provinceι of India, vol. ii. p. 218, 219. ] r Γhis country, though, from its elevation, the elimate is colder than in Hindustan, with iee and snow in winter, is remarkably unhealthy, from a certain malaria which prevails in all the lower valleys, especially during and after the rainy season, and which gives rise to ague, intermittents, and fevers which assume the appearance of typhus, and under which the powers of life decline more rapidly, though often not more surely, than under continued fits of the ague. Several of the inhabitants seen by Bishop Heber in this devoted region, he describes as singularly wretched; the fever and the ague destroying all their energy, and preventing them from adopting the simple means of dry and well-raised dwellings, and sufficient clothing, to support life and health. “They are,” says the intelligent traveller already quoted, “a very ugly and miserable race of human beings, with large heads, and particularly prominent ears, flat noses, tumid bellies, slender limbs, and sallow complexions, and have scarcely any garments but a blanket of black wool, though most of them have matchlocks, swords, and shields.” The chief region of insalubrity is at the foot of the lowest hills, where a long, black, and level \n",

      "an inland county of the province of Leinster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the county of Westmeath, on the east by the county of Kildare, on the south by the Queen’s county and Tipperary, and on the west by the counties of Tipperary, Galway, and Roscommon. In its greatest length from south-west to north-east it measures upwards of fifty miles, and forty-two in its greatest breadth from east to west, but the irregularity of its shape prevents the deduction of any practical inference as to its dimensions from these premises. Its actual extent is 528,166 acres, of which 394,569 are capable of cultivation, 133,349 are unprofitable mountain or bog, and not more than 248 are under water.\n",
      "In the earliest periods of Irish history, this county formed part of the territory of Hy-Falgia, and was also known, by the name of Hy-Laoighis, a denomination that comprehended also the Queen’s county and some other districts. The southern part of it afterwards obtained the name of Ely O’Carroll. It was also known by that of the kingdom of Offaly. In the reign of Philip and Mary it was reduced into shire ground, and assumed the title it still retains, when its assize-town also took its name from the above-named king. At that time the heads of the principal clans were, the O’Conor-Falies, the O’Carrolls of Ely O’Carroll, the M Egans, the O’Delanys, and the O’Meaghers. It is now divided into the twelve baronies of Ballyboy, Ballycowan, Ballybritt, Clonlisk. Coolestown, Eglish or Fircal, Garrycastle, Geashill, Kilcoursey, Upper and Lower Philipstown, and Warrenstown. These are again subdivided into forty-four parishes, besides seven parts of parishes, the remaining parts of which are in some of the adjoining counties.\n",
      "According to former ecclesiastical arrangements of Ireland, this county comprehended parts of the dioceses of Kildare, Meath, Killaloe, Ossory, and Clonfert; but under the new distribution of the dioceses it is comprehended in those of Dublin, Meath, Killaloe, and Ferns.\n",
      "The surface of the country is for the most part level and uninteresting; the great field of floetz limestone, that forms so much of the soil of Ireland, spreading itself over all but its southern portion. Beds of foliated limestone, of a greenish hue and a large granular texture, adapted for various useful purposes, are found at Tullamore. In the south-east, the Slieve Bloom Mountains extend in a direction from north-east to south-west for twenty miles, forming the line of demarcation between the King’s and Queen’s counties. They are steep and craggy, and have but one opening by which they can be crossed, called the Gap of Glandine. They consist of a nucleus of clay, surrounded by sandstone, with tracts of irreclaimable bog at their base. Pure white clay, of a quartzose nature, is found in them. Croghan Hill, in the northern extremity of the county, rises above the surrounding level to the height of more than five hundred feet, clothed with verdure to its summit. It is composed of trap, conglomerate, and floetz limestone. On those parts of its surface the basis of which is lime, the soil is extremely barren; whilst on the other parts it is peculiarly fertile, producing, from time immemorial, good crops of oats and potatoes, without manure. The difference is so marked, that the line of junction of the two formations can be traced by the verdure on the surface. Another elevation of the country, but less remarkable than that of Croghan, is the hill of Cloghan, between the river Brosna and the Slieve Bloom Mountains. Numerous and abundant springs gush from it on all sides. The minerals found here are iron in small quantities, manganese, ochre, chalk, and potters’ clay. The only river that can strictly be considered as belonging to the county is the Brosna, which rises in the county of Westmeath, and discharges itself into the Shannon. This latter river forms a considerable part of the western boundary of the county. The Barrow is its boundary to the south-east, and the Boyne skirts a small portion of its north-eastern extremity. The Lesser Brosna, also a branch of the Shannon, divides the county from Tipperary. The only lake within the county is Lough Pallis, of inconsiderable dimensions. The divisional line which separates the Queen’s county passes through the middle of Lough Annagh, the northern portion of which is therefore considered as belonging to the King’s^county. It is of inconsiderable size, not covering more than 315 acres. Lough Boura, containing 175 acres, is so shallow that it may be safely forded in summer-time.\n",
      "The soil is in general either a deep moor or a shallow gravelly loam; the former is the more productive in dry seasons, the latter in moist. Limestone is abundant in most parts. The pastures, though not luxuriant, form good sheep walks; that on the more mountainous tracts has proved excellent for young cattle. In reclaimed bog, corn crops are some weeks later in ripening than elsewhere, although the natural vegetation is earlier than in the upland pastures. A considerable portion of the great bog of Allen is in this county.\n",
      "The latest return of the population gives an average of one soul to every four acres, or of about one to every acres of cultivated land. The returns of the number of inhabitants at various periods are as follow :—\n",
      "1760, De Burgo 45,618\n",
      "1792, Beaufort 74,500\n",
      "1813, Parliamentary census 113,226\n",
      "1821, Ditto 131,088\n",
      "1831, Ditto 144,029\n",
      "The proportion of Protestants to Catholics is about one to four; the number of dissenters is inconsiderable.\n",
      "The county was represented in the Irish parliament by six members; two for the county at large, and two for each of the boroughs of Philipstown and Banagher. The boroughs were deprived of the right of returning members at the union; and as the reform act has introduced no change into the arrangements then made, the county is now represented only by two members. The state of the constituency, as affected by the various changes made since the year 1829, is shown in the following table, exhibiting the number of electors of the different rates of franchise :—\n",
      "Years. L.50. L.20. L.10. 40s. Total.\n",

      "1st May 1832, 346 225 739 — 1310\n",
      "The peace of the county is maintained by a constabulary force, consisting of five chief constables, forty-eight constables, and 144 sub-constables, total 197, at an expense of L.9124 per annum, being an average of forty-seven pounds each man nearly.\n",

      "1824-26, 5787 3929 423 10,139\n",
      "Of the numbers stated in the latter return, 2064 were of the established church, 7959 Roman Catholics, twenty-two dissenters, and ninety-four whose religious persuasion was not ascertained. The total number of schools was 254, thirty of which, containing 1854 pupils, were supported by grants of public money; twenty-four, containing 1404 pupils, by voluntary subscriptions; and the remaining 200, containing 6881 pupils, were maintained by the fees of those instructed.\n",
      "The crops usually raised are, wheat, oats, barley, and potatoes. Oxen are frequently employed in field labour; a mode of yoking them by the horns is much approved by some intelligent farmers, as being less irritating to the animal, and giving a better direction to its powers. Green crops are very general; rye-grass is much encouraged for early feeding. Great attention is paid to the rearing of horses, in consequence of which the county can boast of a fine breed. The uplands and moors are chiefly employed in feeding young cattle and sheep. The wool of these latter is highly esteemed at Ballinasloe. In the northern baronies there are many dairies, in some of which cheese of a good quality is made. Lime, and limestone gravel, either by itself or formed into a compost with the gatherings of the farm refuse, constitute the general manure. The gravel burned in heaps, with the parings of the moors, produces very heavy crops. Bog stuff is also often used for manure.\n",
      "There is every reason to suppose that the greater portion of this county was once an uninterrupted forest. Wherever the timber is protected it grows up to great size and beauty. The parts bordering upon Tipperary are richly wooded. Alder is indigenous. The ash grown here is preferred to any other by the Dublin workmen. The bogs furnish an inexhaustible supply of fuel, not only from their own peculiar vegetation, but from the trunks and roots of trees raised from them, which produce a quick and lively fire. Notwithstanding the great prevalence of bog, the general surface of the land is of considerable elevation, affording great facilities for conducting the superfluous moisture to the rivers which intersect the country in all directions. The fences are generally of white thorn, which thrives remarkably well here.\n",
      "The condition of the peasantry, though more comfortable than in some other parts of Ireland, is notwithstanding low in comparison with that of the English of the same class. The houses arc small and poor, mostly covered with thatch, and seldom weatherproof. Earthen walls and straw roofs are preferred by most, not only from habit, but as being warmer than stone and slate. Fuel is everywhere plentiful, the bogs furnishing an inexhaustible supply of excellent quality. The food, in general, is potatoes and oatmeal; bearmeal is used in some parts. In Kilcoursey, most of the cottiers’ families consume a bacon pig annually. The peasantry are industrious when excited by what they deem adequate remuneration. The young men frequently leave home in quest of employment, rather than work for wages w hich they consider as too low. The women are remarkable for their industry, insomuch that youths of provident habits who reside elsewhere, frequently come hither in quest of wives. Besides their household occupations, the women prepare the materials for the manufacture\n",

      "a monarch or potentate who rules singly over a people. Camden derives the word from the Saxon cyning, which signifies the same thing; and that from can, power, or ken, knowledge, with which every monarch is supposed to be invested. The Latin rex, the Scythian reiχ, the Punic resch, the Spanish rey, and French roi, come all, according to Postel, from the Hebrew ľ'st, rosch, signifying chief, head. Kings were not known amongst the Israelites till the reign of Saul. Before his time they were governed at first by elders, as in Egypt; next by princes of God’s appointment, as Moses and Joshua; then by judges till the time of Samuel; and lastly, by kings. Most of the Grecian states were governed at first by kings, who were chosen by the people to decide differences, and to execute a power which was limited by laws. They commanded armies, presided over the worship of the gods, and executed other functions. This royalty was generally hereditary; but if the vices of the heir to the crown were odious to the people, or if the oracle had so commanded, he was cut off from the right of succession; yet the kings were supposed to hold their sovereignty by the appointment of Jupiter. The ensign of majesty was the sceptre, which· was made of wood adorned with studs of gold, and ornamented at the top with some figure, commonly that of an eagle, as being the bird of Jove. At first Rome was also governed by kings, who were elected by the people, with the approbation of the senate and concurrence of the augurs. Their power extended to religion, the revenues, the army, and the administration of justice. The monarchical form of government subsisted 244 years in Rome, under seven kings, the last of whom was Tarquinius Superbus. Amongst the Greeks the king of Persia had anciently the appellation of the Great King; the king of France now has that of the Most Christian King, and the king of Spain has that of Catholic King. The king of the Romans is a prince chosen by the emperor, as a coadjutor in the government of the empire. The king of England, by the Lateran council, held under Pope Julius 11-, had the title of Christianissimus conferred on him; and that of Defender of the Faith was added by Pope Leo X. though it had been used by them some time before. The title of Grace was first given to our kings about the time of Henry IV., and that of Majesty was first bestowed on Henry V1II., before whose time our kings were called Grace, Highness, and the like. In all public instruments and letters, the king styles himself nos, we; though till the time of King John he employed the singular number. The definition of king above given is according to the general acceptation of the term. It will not therefore strictly apply to the sovereign of Great Britain. The power of our king is subject to great limitations; but these are the limitations of wisdom and the sources of dignity, being so far from diminishing his honour, that they impart an additional glory to his crown.\n",
      "The oath taken by the king at his coronation is conceived in these terms :—“The archbishop or bishop shall say, Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of Britain, and the dominions thereto belonging, according to the statutes in parliament agreed, and the laws and customs of the same? The hing or queen shall say, I solemnly promise so to do. Archbishop or bishop. Will you to the utmost of your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments? King or queen. I will. Archbishop or bishop. Will you, to the utmost of your power, maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the gospel, and the Protestant reformed religion established by the law? And will you preserve unto the bishops and clergy of this realm, and to the churches committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall appertain unto them, or any of them? King or queen. All this I promise to do. After this the king or queen, laying his or her hand upon the holy gospel, shall say, The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep, so help me God; and then shall kiss the book.” This is the form of the coronation oath, as it is now prescribed by law. The principal articles appear to be at least as ancient as the Mirror of Justices, and even as the time of Bracton; but the wording of it was changed at the Revolution, because, as the statute alleges, the oath itself had been framed in doubtful words and expressions, with relation to ancient laws and constitutions at that time unknown. See England. King at Anns, or of Arms, is an officer of great antiquity, and anciently of great authority, whose business it is to direct the heralds, preside at their chapters, and exercise the jurisdiction of armoury. In England there are three kings of arms, namely, Garter, Clarencieux, and Norroy.\n",
      "The Garter principal King of Anns was instituted by Henry V. His business is to attend the knights of the garter at their assemblies, to marshal the solemnities at the funerals of the highest nobility, and to carry the garter to kings and princes beyond the sea; on which occasion he used to be joined in commission with some principal peer of the kingdom.\n",
      "The Clarencieux KiNGat Arms is so called from the Duke of Clarence, to whom he first belonged. His office is to marshal and dispose the funerals of all the inferior nobility, as baronets, knights, esquires, and gentlemen, on the south side of the Trent.\n",
      "The Norroy King at Arms is an officer whose duty it is to do the same thing on the north side of the river Trent.\n",
      "The two last are also called provincial heralds, because they divide the kingdom into provinces between them. By charter they have power to visit noblemen’s families, to set down their pedigrees, to distinguish their arms, to appoint persons their arms, and with the garter king to direct the other heralds.\n",
      "Anciently the kings at arms were created and solemnly crowned by the kings of England themselves; but in later times the earl marshal has a special commission at every creation to personate the king.\n",
      "Lyon King at Arms for Scotland is the second king at arms for Great Britain, and he is invested and crowned with great solemnity. To him belong the publishing of king’s proclamations, the marshalling of funerals, the reversing of arms, and the like.\n",
      "Kings or Lord Advocate for Scotland. The first in this office noticed by our writers was Sir John de Ross of Mountgreenan, who was appointed advocate to King James HI. about the year 1483. Till his time there does not appear to have been any permanent officer named as king’s advocate, but temporary appointments for particular causes only; as was likewise the case in early times in England, where the attorneys-gcneral were not otherwise constituted till the end of the fourteenth century. Thus, in the claim set up in the parliament of Scotland to the forfeited estates of the Earl of March, appearance was made “procuratoribus et praelocutoribus excellentissimi principis et domini nostri actoris ab uno prosequentis,” 1436, c. 135; and in the prosecution for treason in parliament against the Earl of Douglas in 1455, Lancelot de Abernethie was “proloquitor domini nostri regis.” It was the clerk-register that raised and prosecuted in parliament the indictment for treason against Lord Boyd, November 1469; in the process of forfeiture in parliament against the Earl of Ross, 1475, it was the lord chancellor who conducted the prosecution and led the evidence; and in a process of treason, 1479, the king asked the award of parliament “be his chanceler and advocats.” As respects the court of the lord-justiciar of Scotland, which, prior to the institution of the College of Justice, was the highest court next to the parliament, and possessed of both civil and criminal jurisdiction, it is well known that the clerk of court, or justiee clerk, was long the only public prosecutor.\n",
      "Sir John de Ross was succeeded in the office of king’s advocate by Henryson of Fordel, who continued therein from 1494 till 1507, when he was made justice-clerk in the room of Lawson of Hierigs, appointed king’s advocate. Both these offices of justice-clerk and king’s advocate having become vacant in September 1513, by the fall of Lawson and Henryson on the fatal field of Flodden, Wischeart of Pittarrow was nominated to both places, and he continued to hold them till his death, when thejoffice of king’s advocate was given to Sir William Scot of Bahreary and Adam Otterburn of Redhall, both lords of council. In December 1528, Bahreary was despatched to England in a diplomatic capacity; and having in consequence resigned, he was succeeded by Sir James Foulis of Colintcn, a lord of the session, who, however, on the institution of the College of Justice, accepted the place of clerk-register. Otterburn then became sole king’s advocate, w ith the privilege of pleading within the bar of the new erected court, a privilege till then unknown in our juridical practice; for heretofore all pleaded within the bar, as indeed is still the case in the court of justiciary, where much of the old common law proceedings remain to this day; and in criminal cases the bar was occupied by the prisoner, who was thence styled the panel, a synonyme for bar.\n",
      "To the same period may perhaps be traced the title of Lord Advocate: for, as early as the 2d April 1573, the king’s advocate is so styled;^[1. Pitcairn's Criminal Triait. ] and in the statute 1587, c. 115, the title is given him as his accustomed designation. It had no doubt its origin in the circumstance of his being, from the erection of the court, a lord of session. This latter circumstance may seem the more remarkable of the two, but it admits of easy explanation, and it had its parallel in the old parliament of Paris. The constitution of the court of session, like the ecclesiastical tribunals after which it was modelled, was secret, and all its deliberations took place with closed doors. Provision was \n",

      "after officiating for several months at St Andrews, had returned to Edinburgh at the end of April, and continued to exercise his functions during the siege of Leith. Before the close of the year, he was visited with a severe domestic affliction in the loss of his wife, who left two children of tender years. The young queen returned from France on the 21st of August 1561. Not many days after her arrival, she sent for the reformer, of whose powerful influence she must have been fully aware; but neither this nor any of their subsequent interviews produced the effects which she seems to have anticipated. Such topics as Mary introduced he discussed with undaunted freedom, though it cannot with justice be affirmed that he treated her with incivility. She certainly did not overawe him with her royal presence, or render him less disposed to use his utmost endeavour in destroying the fabric of ancient superstition. The Scotish reformation differed in many respects from that of the neighbouring kingdom. In the one case, the most essential trappings of a proud popish prelacy were left uncurtailed, nor was the church sufficiently purified from popish devices and observances.^[5. The genuine high-churchmen seem to feel some lingering regret for the discontinuance of the popish prayers for the dead. “In truth,” says Mr Waddington, “to pray for the souls of our departed friends is the most natural and pardonable error of piety; and although it be dangerous and improper to inculcate as a church doctrine the efficacy of such prayers, it would neither be right to discourage their private and individual effusion, nor easy to disprove the possibility of their acceptance.” (Present Condition and Prospect» of the Greek or Oriental Church, p. 37∙ Lond. 1829, 8vo.) “Some persons,” remarks Mr Palmer, “will perhaps say that this sort of prayer is unscriptural; that it infers either the Romish doctrine of purgatory, or something else which is contrary to the revealed will of God, or the nature of things. But when we reflect that the great divines of the English church have not taken this ground, and that the church of England herself has never formally condemned prayers for the dead, but only omitted them in her liturgy, we may perhaps think that there are some other reasons to justify that omission.” {Origines Liturgicoe, or Antiquities of the English Ritual, vol. ii. p. 94. Oxford, 1832, 2 vols. 8vo.) This work, which is learned and curious in its way, might with a considerable degree of propriety have been entitled “The Conformity of the Church of England with the Church of Rome.” Among other important facts, he is pleased to state that “the bishops who rule the churches of these realms were validly ordained by others, who by means of an unbroken spiritual descent of ordinations derived their mission from the apostles, and from our Lord. This continual descent is evident to any one who chooses to investigate it. Let him read the catalogues of our bishops ascending up to the most remote period. Our ordinations descend in a direct unbroken line from Peter and Paul, the apostles of the circumcision and the Gentiles. These great apostles successively ordained Linus, Cletus, and Clement, bishops of Rome; and the apostolical line of succession was regularly continued from them to Celestine, Gregory, and Vitalianus, who ordained Patrick bishop for the Irish, and Augustine and Theodore for the English. And from those times an uninterrupted series of valid ordinations have carried down the apostolical succession in our churches, even to the present day. There is not a bishop, priest, or deacon amongst us, who cannot, if he pleases, trace his own spiritual descent from Saint Peter and Saint Paul.” (Vol. ii. p. 249.) To this last assertion it is only necessary to oppose another; namely, that there is not a single bishop, priest, or deacon, who can trace his own spiritual origin for one half of the requisite period. But what advantage could possibly result from their tracing it with the utmost certainty? Till they make an unequivocal display of their miraculous powers, we must totally disregard their extraordinary pretensions. By arguments equally logical and cogent, the bishop of Rome undertakes to prove that he inherits all the spiritual gifts and graces of St. Peter, and to these is fully entitled to add all the temporal power and possessions to which he can extend his impious hand. This delirious dream of apostolical succession is disgraceful to the protestant name; and all those whom it bewilders would best maintain their consistency by returning to the bosom of their mother chruch. ] The sign of the cross in baptism, with the entire apparatus of godfathers and godmothers, some part of the funeral service, kneeling at the communion, the power of the priest to remit or to retain sins, and the power of the bishop to confer the gift of the Holy Ghost, ought to have been left in the sole and undisputed possession of those who still adhere to the mass and transubstantiation. Queen Elizabeth, the head of the church, was deeply tinctured with popery; insomuch that she was dissatisfied with the twenty-ninth article, as implying a denial of the doctrine of the real presence. She reluctantly permitted the crucifix and tapers to be removed from the altar in her chapel. It seems to have been by her private authority that a clause, unsanctioned by the convocation, was added to the twentieth article;^[6. See Archdeacon Blackburne’s Confessional, p. 368, and Dr Lamb’s Historical Account of the thirty-nine Articles, p. 33. Cambridge, 1829, 4 to. ] a clause which makes the averment that “the church hath power to decree rites  or ceremonies, and authority m controversies of faith.” The king or queen superseded the pope as head of the ehurch; and thus a protestant body might have, and in more instances than one has actually had, a popish head. Pluralities and non-residenee, two manifest remnants of popery, have been closely interwoven with an establishment, in which the idle splendour of one class of ecclesiastics is placed in so indecent a contrast with the laborious poverty of another.^[7. Bishop Lowth has stated that “there were some in England who, by the pope’s authority, possessed at once twenty ecclesiastical benefices and dignities, with dispensation moreover for holding as many more as they could lawfully procure, without limitation of number.” (Life of William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, p. 28, 3d edit. Oxford, 1777, 8vo.) In what protestant country, except England and Ireland, is the system of pluralities and non-residence maintained to any extent? They are an intolerable nuisance, which even there must very speedily be abated. Even the regius professor of divinity at Oxford is convinced that there is a great and general “demand for church reform and as Dr Burton is a man of sense as well as learning, he must likewise be aware that, when there is a great and general demand for any commodity, it can in most cases be supplied. His notions of reform, as the reader may easily conjecture, are not extravagant; and some of his suggestions are not deficient in worldly wisdom. It is notorious, as he avers, that many clergymen enjoy the income of their benefices, because the presentations have been bought and sold; and “if any legislative enactment should reduce their incomes, the patrons must in all fairness refund part of the purchase money·” (Thoughts upon the Demand for Church Reform, p. 38. Oxford, 1831, 8vo.) All the lay-dealers in such articles must therefore perceive the dangerous tendency of a reform in the church. ]\n",
      "At this period, the metropolis of Scotland contained only one parish church. Knox was at first assisted by a reader, named John Cairns. It was then his regular practice to preach twice every Sunday, and thriee on other days of the w eek; but in the year 1563, John Craig, minister of Canongate, was appointed his colleague. In 1562, he had for three successive days been engaged at Maybole in a public disputation with Quintin Kennedy, abbot of Crossragwell; and in the eourse of the following year, an account of it was printed at Edinburgh, under this title: “Heir followeth the coppie of the Ressoning which was betuix the Abbote of Crosragucll and John Knox.” Another learned catholic, Ninian Winzet, addressed to him a “Buke of fourseoir thre Questionis,” to which it was his intention to publish an answer, though he seems to have been prevented by his other avoeations, which were sufficiently numerous. After this period he incurred the hot indignation of the queen for having, in one of his public discourses, animadverted with great freedom on her intended marriage. During one of their interviews, she wept bitter tears of anger; and some modern historians have been not a little scandalized at his want of gallantry. In the month of December 1563, he was summoned before the privy council on a charge of high treason, for having written a circular letter to the protestant gentlemen, in reference to the trial of two persons who had been indicted for a riot in the chapel royal. Of this charge he was fully acquitted, to the great disappointment of Mary and the popish party.\n",

This marriage took place in March 1564, when he had attained the age of fifty-nine. The noble family with which he thus became connected was descended from Robert duke of Albany, second son of King Robert the Second. Knox was again brought before the privy council, for having, in a sermon preached in St Giles’s on the 19th of August 1565, used certain expressions, or rather quoted certain texts, whieh gave great offence to the king, who was present, and applied them to himself.

      "a considerable kingdom of Western Africa. It is bounded on the west by the Bullom, Limba, and Timmanee countries; on the north by Limba, Tamisso, and Soolimana; on the east by Kissi, the Niger, and countries little known; and on the south by those countries which border on the coast. These limits include a very extensive tract of country, but the boundary lines are somewhat indefinite; indeed they are continually fluctuating, according to the fortunes of war as it is practised amongst savage tribes of men. For our knowledge of Koorankoo we are indebted to the enterprise of Major Laing, by whom is was visited and has been described. A chain of hills, sixty miles in length, runs in a north-easterly direction throughout the whole of the country. These are for the most part clothed at their base with the camwood tree, which constitutes the staple article of trade. The range is composed of micaceous granite and mica slate, interspersed with veins of quartz and laterite, so strongly impregnated with iron as sensibly to affect the needle at some inches distance. The principal rivers appear to be the Rokelle and the Kamaranka. The source of the former is set down in Major Laing’s map as in latitude 9. 45. north, longitude 9. 55. west, a parallel which lies in the Soolima country. It issues from the foot of a hill, by barometrical measurement 1470 feet above the level of the Atlantic; and after receiving several tributaries, and traversing Koorankoo and. other countries, falls into the sea at Sierra Leone, to which colony it is of great importance. The Rokelle is the only river, says Major Laing, which bears one name from the source to the sea. The rivulets and longer streams which discharge themselves into it are picturesquely beautiful, dashing over rugged granite rocks several hundred feet in elevation. One of the tributaries, called Ba-Jafana, had a bed of about fifteen yards in breadth, though only about three miles from its source, which is in a mountain named Balakonko, where the natives procure the camwood in great abundance. The banks of the river are likewise lined with this wood, which grows to the height of about sixty feet. The Tongolelle, a rapid stream about thirty yards broad, also joins the Rokelle. It takes its rise in a sort of basin, surrounded with thick brushwood, and gives birth to a rich and luxuriant growth of wild canes in its centre, affording a cool retreat to the leopards which infest this part of the country. To such an extent are these rapacious animals dreaded, that Major Laing “observed the sites of several towns now in ruin, the inhabitants of which had been forced to move to the westward to avoid their attacks.” The Kamaranka appears to be a river of the same size and general character as the Rokelle. It has also numerous tributaries. All the rivulets running south through the mountain chain already mentioned collect behind a lofty hill called Botato, and fall into it. About a mile from Nyiniah, one of the largest and best-built towns in Koorankoo, is the source of a fine stream, which joins the Kamaranka. The spring forms a basin ten yards in diameter, embanked with masses of granite, and overhung with lofty trees, clad with a foliage so thick as to bid defiance to the rays even of a vertical sun. Major Laing describes the scenery in this quarter as occasionally very picturesque and beautiful. After crossing a range of hills to the eastward of Nyiniah, there presented itself to the eye of the traveller “an extensive valley, partly cultivated, and partly covered with long natural grass about five feet high, the cultivated part newly u u r n; lines of stately palm trees, as regular as if laid out by art, with here and there a cluster of camwood trees, their deep shade affording a relief to the lighter hue of the smaller herbage; these, with a murmuring rivulet meandering through the centre, exhibited the appearance of a well-cultivated and tastily-arranged garden, rather than a tract amid the wilds of Africa; whilst, in the distance, mountain towered above mountain in all the grandeur and magnificence of nature. There was also seen an extensive plain covered with short, thin grass; and our traveller having crossed a mountain ridge which separates the head streams of the Kamaranka, flowing southward, from those which reach the Rokelle, he ascended a lofty erninencö called Sa Wolle. The summit of this mountain, according to barometrical measurement, was 1900 feet above the level of the sea, and the view from it was grand and extensive in the highest degree. A capacious circle of nearly two degrees in diameter, interrupted only by a hill to the eastward, which rose considerably higher, presented a landscape of the most rich and varied scenery.\n",
      "Camwood is the staple article of trade, and it is sent down the Rokelle and the Kamaranka to be bartered for various articles, chiefly salt. There is also a considerable advantage derived from the extensive manufacture of cloth. The loom in which this is wove is very narrow. The artisan sits under an open shed, from the roof of which are suspended two frames of equal breadth with the roof, nicely divided with perpendicular strings. ' By a motion of the feet, these are made to cross one another alternately, and at each motion the shuttle is cast through. In this manner of working they exhibit much dexterity, and make good progress. Women are employed in spinning thread, but the sowing and weaving are performed by men.\n",
      "Major Laing observes, “Koorankoo is the first country to the eastward of Sierra Leone where the manufacture of cloth is common; but it is generally of a coarse quality. As the traveller advances eastward, he finds the natives improve both in the texture of the cloth and the size of the loom. In Sangara, very large and handsome cloths are manufactured.” The Koorankoos also cultivate a considerable portion of their ground; and in general intelligence and industry they rank above the neighbouring tribes. Each house has its enclosed garden, where are raised cassada, in the cultivation of which they bestow great care; spinach, small onions, and tankana, an herb which, when dried and beaten, answers as a cheap substitute for snuff. In religion they are for the most part pagans, and they exercise unlimited faith in grce-grees (a sort of protecting spirits), for whom they have houses consecrated at the entrances of the towns. The head men are clothed in a long gown, trousers, cap, and sandals, but the women are contented with more scanty habiliments. They are great adepts in the art of dressing hair, and ornament each other’s heads with great skill. Dancing is a favourite amusement; and on the night of a funeral, which always takes place the day after the demise of the individual, they exhibit their skill in this art, brandishing hatchets or spears in both hands. The laws of this people are few and inartificial. Murder is the only crime punishable with death, and even this can be compensated by property.\n",
      "There is a portion of the Koorankoo country inhabited by the tribe called the Soolimas. They have a territory of their own, which Major Laing describes as picturesque in the extreme, being diversified with hills, extensive vales, and fertile meadows, belted with stripes of wood, and decorated with clumps of trees of the densest foliage. The soil is remarkably fertile, producing chiefly rice, yams, which are planted like potatoes in England, and ground nuts, which are cultivated like our field peas. Bananas, pines, and oranges, are the principal fruits; but the first only are found in any degree of perfection. The Soolimas have numerous herds and flocks, and a diminutive kind of poultry. The elephant, the buffalo, a species of antelope, monkeys, leopards, and wolves, are the wild animals. The principal towns of the Soolimas are all situated in the Koorankoo country. These are Falaba, the capital; Sangonia, a very large town on the borders of Footah Jallou, surrounded with a strong and lofty wall; Semba, a large, populous, and rich town near the southern frontier, situated on a very lofty eminence; Mousaiah and Koonko-doogore, a stage from Semba, in the hills. In all, these places contain a population of about 25,000 souls. Falaba derives its name from the river Fala, on which it stands. It is nearly a mile and a half in length, by a mile in breadth, and closely built compared with the generality of African towns. It was built in 1768 by the Soolima king, as a stronghold to protect him against his enemies theFoolahs; and the site is well chosen as a place of defence, being on a gently-rising eminence in the centre of a large plain. The town is surrounded by a strong stockade of hard wood, and a deep and broad ditch, which renders it quite impregnable according to the military tactics of the Africans. It contains about four thousand circular clay huts, having pyramidal roofs of thatch; and, being neat and clean, they present a very respectable appearance. The palaver or court-house stands in an open space, towards the southern extremity of the town, and is a place of recreation as well as of business. In the centre of the town a large piece of ground is left vacant, for the purposes of exercise, of receiving strangers, and of holding palavers. Formerly the Soolimas chiefly occupied themselves in war, but this is less practised amongst them now than heretofore. In person they are short and muscular, and well adapted to endure privation and fatigue. Their military weapons are the spear, the musket, the sling, and the bow: in the management and use of the two latter they are most expert. Where their predatory habits do not interfere, they seemed to Major Laing both mild and inoffensive in disposition. In their domestic occupations the men and women appear to have changed places. The men attend to the dairy; they also sow and reap; but all the other cares of husbandry devolve upon the female sex. They are masons, plasterers, surgeons, and the like; w\n",

      "an eminent scholastic philosopher of France, of noble descent, was born at Palais near Nantes in Bretagne, in the year 1079. Devoted to letters by his father’s appointment, and by his own inclination, his literary attainments could at this time only be exhibited in the field of scholastic philosophy; and, that he might be fitted for his destined career of life, he was placed, after a previous course of grammatical studies, under the tuition of Rosceline, a celebrated metaphysician, and founder of the sect of the Nominalists. Under the instructions of this able master, at the early age of sixteen, he furnished himself with a large store of scholastic knowledge, and acquired a subtiltyand quickness of thought, a fluency of speech, and facility of expression, which were necessary qualifications in scholastic disputation.\n",
      "Having spent some time in visiting the schools of several provinces, in the twentieth year of his age he fixed his residence in the university of Paris, then the first seat of learning in Europe. The master, William de Champeaux, was at that time in high repute for his knowledge of philosophy, and his skill in the dialectic art; to him he committed the direction of his studies, and was at first contented with receiving instruction from so eminent a preceptor. De Champeaux was proud of the talents of his pupil, and admitted him to his friendship. But the aspiring youth ventured to contradict the opinions of his master, and in the public school held disputations with him, in which he was frequently victorious. The jealousy of the master and-the vanity of the pupil naturally occasioned a speedy separation.\n",
      "Elated by success, and confident of his own powers, Abelard, without hesitation, at the age of twenty-two, opened a public school of his own. Melun, a town ten leagues -from Paris, where the court frequently resided, was the place which he chose for this bold display of his talents. But it was not without considerable difficulty that Abelard executed his plan; for De Champeaux, who regarded him as a rival, openly employed all his interest against him. Abelard at length prevailed, his school was opened, and his lectures were attended by crowded and admiring auditories. Emboldened by this success, and perhaps stimulated by unworthy resentment, Abelard resolved to maintain an open contest with his master, and for this purpose removed his school to Corbeil near Paris. The disputants frequently met in each other’s schools; and the contest was supported on each side with great spirit, amidst crowds of their respective scholars. The young champion was in the end victorious, and his antagonist was obliged to retire.\n",
      "Constant application and violent exertions had how so far impaired Abelard’s health, that it was become necessary for him to interrupt his labours; and, with the advice of his physician, he withdrew to his native country. Two years afterwards, he returned to Corbeil,∙and found that De Champeaux had taken the monastic habit among the regular canons in the convent of St Victor; but that he still continued to teach rhetoric and logic, and to hold public disputations in theology. Returning to the charge, he renewed the contest, and his opponent was obliged to acknowledge himself defeated. The scholars of De Champeaux deserted him, and went over in crowds to Abelard. Even the new professor, who had taken the former school of De Champeaux, voluntarily surrendered the chair to the young philosopher, and requested to be enrolled among his disciples. A triumph so complete, while it gratified the vanity of Abelard, could not fail to provoke the resentment of his old master, who had influence to obtain the appointment of a new professor, and drive Abelard back to Melun. De Champeaux’s motive for this violent proceeding was soon perceived; even his friends were ashamed of his conduct; and he retired from the convent into the country. W’hen Abelard was informed of the flight of his adversary, he returned towards Paris, and took a new station at the abbey on Mount St Genevieve. His rival, the new professor, was unequal to the contest, and was soon deserted by his pupils, who flocked to the lectures of Abelard. De Champeaux, too, returning to his monastery, renewed the struggle; but so unsuccessfully, that Abelard was again victorious.\n",
      "During a short absence, in which Abelard visited his native place, De Champeaux was preferred to the see of Chalons. The long and singular contest between these philosophers terminated; and Abelard, perhaps for want of a rival to stimulate his exertions, or possibly through envy of the good fortune of his rival, determined to exchange the study and profession of philosophy for that of theology. He therefore quitted his school at St Genevieve, and removed to Laon, to become a scholar of Anselm. From this celebrated master he entertained high expectations; but they were soon disappointed. On attending his lectures, he found that, though he possessed uncommon fluency of language, he left his auditors without instruction. Abelard gradually retired from these unprofitable lectures, but without offering offence either to the veteran professor or his scholars. In conversation one of them asked him, what he thought of the study of the Scriptures? Abelard replied, that he thought the ex planation of them a task of no great difficulty; and to prove his assertion, he undertook to give a comment, the next day, upon any part of the Scriptures they should mention. They fixed upon the beginning of the prophecy of Ezekiel; and the next morning he explained the passage in a theological lecture, which was heard with admiration. For several successive days, the lectures were, at the request of the∙audience, continued; the whole town pressed to hear them; and the name of Abelard was echoed through the streets of Laon. Anselm, jealous of the rising fame of this young theologian, prohibited his lectures, under the pretence that so young a lecturer might fall into mistakes, which would bring discredit upon his master. Abelard, whose ambition required a wider field than that ot Laon, obeyed the prohibition, and withdrew. He returned to Paris, whither the fame of his theological talents had arrived before him, and opened his school with his lectures on the prophecy of Ezekiel. His auditors were delighted; his school was crowded with scholars; and he united in his lectures the sciences of theology and philosophy with so much success, that multitudes repaired to him from various parts of France, from Spain, Italy, Germany, Flanders, and Great Britain.\n",
      "Hitherto Abelard has appeared with high distinction, as an able disputant, and a popular preceptor: we must now view him under a different character, and when nearly arrived at the sober age of forty, see him, on a sudden, exchanging the school of philosophy for the bower of pleasure, and even disgracing himself, as will too plainly appear in the sequel, by forming and executing a deliberate plan for the seduction of female innocence. It happened that there was at this time, resident in Paris, Heloise, the niece of Fulbert, one of the canons of the cathedral church, a lady about eighteen years of age, of great personal beauty, and highly celebrated for her literary attainments. Abelard, whose vanity had been satiated with fame, and the vigour of whose mind was now enervated by repose, found himself inclined to listen to the voice of passion. He beheld with ardent admiration the lovely Heloise, and confident that his personal attractions were still irresistible, he determined to captivate her affections. Fulbert, who doubtless thought himself honoured by the visits of so eminent a scholar and philosopher, received him into his house as a learned friend. He was soon afterwards prevailed upon, by a handsome payment which Abelard offered for his board, to admit him into his family; and, apprehending no hazard from a man of Abelard’s age and profession, requested him to undertake the instruction of Heloise. Abelard accepted the trust, but, as it seems, without any other intention than to betray it. The hours of instruction were employed in other lessons than those of learning and philosophy; but Fulberťs respectful opinion of the philosopher, and his partiality for his niece, long concealed from him an amour, which was become the subject of general conversation. Upon discovering her pregnancy, it was thought necessary for her to quit her uncle’s house; and Abelard conveyed her to Bretagne, where his sister was prepared to receive them. Here Heloise was delivered of a son, to whom they gave the whimsical name of Astrolabus. Abelard, upon the birth of the child, proposed to Fulbert to marry his niece, provided the marriage might be kept secret: Fulbert consented, and Abelard returned to Bretagne to fulfil his engagement. Heloise, partly out of regard to the honour of Abelard, whose profession bound him to celibacy, and partly from a romantic notion that love like hers ought not to submit to ordinary restraints, at first gave Abelard a peremptory refusal. He, however, at last prevailed, and they were privately married at Paris. Heloise from this time met with severe treatment from her uncle, which furnished Abelard with a plea for’ removing her from his house, and placing her in the abbey of Benedictine nuns, in which she had been educated. Fulbert concluded, perhaps not without reason, that Abelard had taken this step, in order to rid himself of an encumbrance which obstructed his future prospects. Deep resentment took possession of his soul, and he meditated revenge. He employed several ruffians to enter his chamber by night, and inflict upon his person a disgraceful and cruel mutilation. The deed was perpetrated; the ruffians were taken, and suffered, according to the Lex Talionis, the punishment they had inflicted; and Fulbert, for his savage revenge, was deprived of his benefice, and his goods were confiscated.

      "a county in Scotland, situate in the north-east, between 56. 52. and 57. 42. north latitude, and between 1. 49. and 3. 48. of longitude west from Greenwich. It is bounded by the German Ocean on the north and east; by the counties of Kincardine, Forfar, and Perth, on the south; and by those of Inverness, Moray, and Banff, on the west. Its greatest length is 85, arid breadth 40 miles; the bounding line being about 280 miles, of which 60 are on the sea-coast. By a careful measurement of Arrowsmith’s map, it is found to contain 1960 square miles, an area equal to 1,254,400 English or 994,520 Scotch acres; of which somewhat more than one-third is under cultivation. It contains 85 parishes, and is usually described under five divisions. First, Marr, which is a mountainous district, particularly Braemar, the highland part of it; few of the bounding mountains being less than 3000 feet, and several of them more than 4000 feet above the level of the sea. Red deer are here found in great numbers, sometimes 300 in a flock; and moor game abounds in this as in all the more elevated parts of the county. Second, Formartin, of which the land on the sea-coast is low and fertile; but hills and mosses are spread over the interior. Third, Euchan, the most extensive division next to Marr, having a bold precipitous shore of 50 miles, but generally a flat surface, the soil of which has been greatly improved of late by the cultivation of turnips and clover. The Bullers of Buchan, about 6 miles south from Peterhead, is a natural curiosity, which has been often described by tourists. Fourth, Garioch, a large and beautiful valley, naturally very fertile. Before the introduction of modern husbandry, it was termed the granary of Aberdeen. And, fifth, Strathbogie, the greater part of which consists of hills, mosses, and moors. On a comprehensive review, it may be said, that, with the exception of the low grounds of Buchan, and the highlands of the south-west division, Aberdeenshire consists for the most part of tracks nearly level, but often bleak, naked, and unfertile, though interspersed with many rich spots in a high state of cultivation. In extent, it is very nearly one-sixteenth part of Scotland.\n",
      "Aberdeenshire is not rich in mineral productions. No coal has been found in it, and limestone, though it exists in many parts, is by no means abundant. Slatè quarries are wrought to a small extent on the hill of Foudland, in the Garioch division; manganese is found near Aberdeen; and black lead has been discovered in the neighbourhood of Huntly. The mountains of Braemar contain those precious stones called Cairηgοηims by the country people, who go thither in whole families to search for them during the summer season; they are sold, sometimes at high prices, chiefly to the London jewellers. But granite is the most abundant mineral, and has brought considerable sums into the county, besides supplying the inhabitants with excellent stones, for building and other purposes. As many stones have been raised from an acre of land under preparation for tillage, as brought from L.30 to L.50, for paving the streets of London. The exportation of granite to the capital employed at one time about 70 vessels of 7000 tons, and 400 men; and the value of all the stones exported yearly was stated at L.40,000.\n",
      "The principal rivers are the Dee and the Don. The gross annual produce of the salmon-fisheries on these two rivers was estimated a few years ago at nearly L.35,000. The Ythan and Ugic within the county, and the Deveron and Bogie on its boundaries, are also considerable streams. Muscles are plentiful near the mouth of the Ythan; and pearl muscles have been sometimes discovered at its lower extremity. One of the jewels of the ancient crown of Scotland, a valuable pearl, is said to have been found here.\n",
      "There are also several lakes well stored with pike, trout, eels, and other kinds of fish. The county is noted for its chalybeate springs at Peterhead, Fraserburgh, and at Pananich on the Dee.\n",
      "The climate of Aberdeenshire, except in the mountainous districts, is rendered comparatively mild by its being bounded on two sides by the sea. The winters are not so severe as in some of the southern counties, but the springs are late, owing to the prevalence of easterly winds; and in autumn the weather is often wet and stormy. Wheat, however, and all the other crops cultivated in Scotland, come to perfection; and the inhabitants, who are not subject to any local diseases, sometimes live to a great age.\n",
      "The district of Marr, containing almost half the county, abounds in natural woods, which are a source of wealth to their proprietors, and of profitable employment to the inhabitants. This country is so well adapted to the growth of trees, that it is only necessary to shut out the cattle by inclosures, and the birds and winds supply it with seeds that soon rise into vigorous plants. These woods consist chiefly of Scotch fir; and the timber, especially what grows in the forests of Braemar, has been thought superior to any that Scotland has imported from the north of Europe. About a tenth part of the whole surface of the county is under wood; and the trees found in the peat mosses indicate the existence of still more extensive forests in former ages.\n",
      "Ruins of ancient edifices are seen in different parts of the county. In the Garioch district, the vitrified fort called Dun-o-Deer, built on the summit of a beautiful conical hill, which springs about 300 feet from its base, is supposed to be 1000 years old; and is said to have been the residence of King Gregory the Great (as he is called by the old Scotish historians), who died in 892. The ruins of two buildings, supposed to have belonged to Malcolm Kenmore, who died in 1004, arc still pointed out. One of them, situate at Castletown of Braemar, was his hunting seat; the other stands in a small island in Loch Kanders, and must have been inaccessible, except when the lake was frozen. A wooden bridge, which connected it with the land, has been found in the lake. The castle of Kil-drummy, which in 1150 was the property of Daγid Earl of Huntingdon, must have been a princely edifice, covering nearly an acre of ground; and its venerable remains still show the power and grandeur of the chieftains by whom it was inhabited. In the same district are some ancient subterraneous retreats, supposed to have been used by the Picts as places of refuge from an invading enemy.\n",
      "The agriculture of Aberdeenshire has been considerably improved of late years; potatoes, turnips, and clover, as well as wheat and other crops, arc now cultivated according to the best courses of modern husbandry. Farms, however, are still generally of a small size, compared with those of the south-eastern counties; and the buildings, though gradually improving, are for the most part much less convenient and comfortable. Here, as in every other part of Scotland, a lease for nineteen years is the most common bond of connection between the landholder and farmer; but it would appear that the covenants of leases are still in a considerable degree dictated by feudal ideas.\n",
      "In most parts of Aberdeenshire, cattle are a more important object to the tenantry than corn; the number is stated at 110,000; and the sales, to England and to the south of Scotland, amounting to about 12,000, were estimated some years ago to bring L.150,000 annually. About two-thirds of the population depend entirely on agriculture; oatmeal, prepared in different ways, with potatoes, is the principal food of the labouring classes.\n",
      "Besides the salmon-fisheries already noticed, the sea fishing employs a number of hands. The Greenland whale-fishery is carried on with great success, by ships fitted out from Aberdeen and Peterhead. The whole fisheries connected with the county are said to yield from L.80,000 to L.100,000 annually.\n",
      "The old staple manufacture, the knitting of stockings, has declined considerably for several years; but those in wool, cotton, and flax, are upon an extensive scale, and employ a large proportion of the inhabitants. There are also establishments for making sail-cloth, inkle, paper, &c.; and, from the characteristic ingenuity and enterprise of the people, Aberdeenshire may soon assume a still higher rank among the manufacturing counties of Britain.\n",
      "A share of our foreign trade, chiefly with the north of Europe, has been long enjoyed by this county, and the ~ecent improvements on the harbour of Aberdeen must contribute essentially to the extension of its commerce. There were, in 1810, belonging to Aberdeen, Peterhead, and Newburgh, 207 vessels, carrying 23,390 tons, and employing 1473 men. In 1807 a canal was opened from the harbour of Aberdeen to the town of Inverury, a distance of 18½ miles, the expense of which was about L.44,000. The facilities which this canal affords for the conveyance of coal and lime have already proved highly beneficial to the agriculture of the county.\n",
      "The valued rent of the county is L.235,665. 8s. lid.\n",
      "Scots; but the real rent for the lands and houses is probably not less than L.300,000 sterling.\n",
      "The principal seats in Aberdeenshire are, Aboyne Castle, the Earl of Aboyne; Ellon Castle and Haddo House, the Earl of Aberdeen; Huntly Lodge, the Duke of Gordon; Keith Hall, the Earl of Kintore; Marr Lodge, the Earl of Fife; Philorth House, Lord Saltoun; Pitfour, Ferguson; Castle Forbes, Lord Forbes; Skene House, Skene; Slaines Castle, the Earl of Errol. The prevailing names among the proprietors are, Gordon, Forbes, Grant, Fraser, Duff, and Ferguson. The county sends one member to parliament, and its three royal boroughs, Aberdeen, Kintore, and Inverury, have a share in the election of other two; Aberdeen, with other four boroughs in the adjoining counties, returning one, and Kintore and Inver - ury, along with other three, another member.\n",

      "in Natural Philosophy, denotes generally an increase of motion or velocity, and is chiefly applied to the motion of such bodies as go on, not with a uniform motion, but one which becomes continually quicker and quicker as they advance. A body, for example, rolling down a hill proceeds slowly at first, but gradually increases as it descends, until at last it acquires a velocity and momentum which bears down every thingbefore it. The same thing takes place when a body is dropped, and allowed to fall freely in the air; although the acceleration is here less observable, on account of the great rapidity of the descent. The earth, in its annual motion round the sun, is subject to a continued acceleration from the apogee to the perigee, while from thence again it suffers a similar retardation. Many other examples occur of such acceleration; but the most interesting is the Acceleration of Falling Bodies. That such an acceleration does take place, is obvious from many circumstances, particularly the increasing momentum which a body acquires in proportion to the height of its descent But it was only by considering the cause of the descent that the true law of the acceleration was determined. This great discovery we owe to the genius of Galileo. Various theories had been framed by philosophers to account for the accelerated descent of falling bodies, but all of them inconclusive and visionary. Some, for instance, ascribed it to the weight of the pure air above increasing as the body descended. The followers of Gassendi pretended that there are continually issuing out of the earth certain attractive corpuscles directed in an infinite number of rays; those, say they, ascend and then descend in such a manner, that the nearer a body approaches to the earth’s centre, the more of these attractive rays press upon it, in consequence of which its motion becomes accelerated. The Cartesians again ascribed the effect to the reiterated impulses of their materia subtilis acting continually on falling bodies, and propelling them downwards. It appears now incredible how such dreams could have been gravely proposed by men having the reputation of philosophers. Galileo, however, on considering the subject attentively, and applying the powerful aids of geometry and mathematics, soon discovered that the true cause was simply the continued action of the moving force of gravity. This force, Galileo reasoned, must operate continually on the body, not only at the moment of starting, but also during every moment of its descent. And as the body retains and accumulates all these impressions according to the great and original law of moving bodies, no wonder that its motion should become continually accelerated: for, suppose that gravity were to act only at certain small intervals, each second for instance, and suppose that at first it communicates such a motion to the body as causes it to descend, say ten feet in the first second; the body could not stop here even though gravity were ceasing altogether to act on it: retaining the original impression, it would still go on moving uniformly at the rate of ten feet every second of its descent; but at the end of the first second, gravity again acts on it and communicates a second impression, by virtue of which it would descend ten feet during the second interval, in addition to the ten feet arising from the original impulse; so that on the whole it descends 20 feet in the second interval. In the same manner, during the third interval it would descend 30 feet, and during the fourth 40, and so on; the space described in each second thus increasing regularly with the increase of the time.\n",
      "Hence Galileo deduced the fundamental law of acceleration in falling bodies, that the Velocity, which in every case is just the space described in each second or other fixed interval, increases in exact proportion to the whole time of descent; so that whatever be the velocity at the end of the first second, then at the end of any number of seconds the velocity would just be as many times greater,—a law from which he easily deduced all the others regarding the descent of falling bodies, which are of so much importance in mechanical inquiries. The most remarkable is that which regards the Space ^[1. This phrase, we may remark, probably from Galileo’s geometrical illustration, haá been rather atìkwardlý Introduced in tħese discussions, and in a way which tends to produce a little obscurity. Space generally includes the idea of extension, in at least two dimensions, both length and breadth; whereas it is here employed to denote merely the lineal extent, the length of the track deshibed by the moving body, ] described, or the total amount of the descent in a given time. This Galileo deduced very elegantly from a simple geometrical consideration. In every case of a body moving uniformly without acceleration, the space described in any given time must be proportional to the time, and must be found by multiplying the time by the velocity: it may be represented, therefore, by a simple diagram. Let A B, for instance, denote by its length the velocity of the body, or the number of feet described by it in a second, and CD the time or number of seconds during which it is in motion; then, if we construct a rectangle a E, of which one of the sides, a b, is equal to A B, and the other, c d, equal to C D, this rectangle, that is, the number of square feet in it, will denote the space, that is, the number of lineal feet described during the· whole period. Let us now apply this principle to the case of a body moving with an accelerated velocity, and let AB, CD, EF, &c. denote the velocities at the end of certain equal intervals of time, of which let each be denoted by l m ; and suppose also, that during each of these intervals the motion is uniform, and is only accelerated by a sort of start which takes place at the end of each: then, if we construct a rectangle a l b, of which a b is equal to A B, the velocity at the end of the first interval, and α l equal to l m the first interval, this rectangle will denote the space described during that interval. Continue now the line a l to m, making l m — α I = I rn, and continue also I c to d, so that l d may be equal to D C, the velocity during the second interval, and complete the rectangle dime, this will denote the space described in the second interval; and, in the same manner, each of the succeeding rectangles in descending will denote the space described in the succeeding interval, so that the total amount of the descent will be denoted by the sum of all the rectangles together, or by the compound figure which they form. But what is the nature of this figure? It is evidently, as appears more clearly by taking out the parallel lines, triangular, only that the longest side presents a serrated outline. What is the cause of this? It is clearly owing to the supposition we have made of the motion continuing uniform during the intervals, and then increasing by starts; instead of growing continually, as it really does. Suppose then that we shorten the intervals one-half, for instance, and double their number, we shall then be much nearer the truth; but the inequalities in the hypothenuse of the triangle are now greatly reduced; and the more we thus diminish the intervals, and increase their number, the more nearly does it approach to a straight line, In the extreme case, therefore, where there are in reality no intervals, but where the velocity goes on continually increasing, neither will there be any inequalities in the outline; the figure will be really a triangle: and while the vertical side A B denotes the time of descent, and the horizontal B C the velocity, the area of the triangle will denote in square measure the space descended in the given time. But the areas of similar triangles are in every case proportional to the squares of their corresponding sides; that is, the area ABC is to A D E as the square of A B or B C is to the square of A D or D E. Hence in general it follows, that the spaces described in any given time or times are always proportional to the squares of these times, and also to the squares of the velocities at the end of such times. Thus, if a body describes 16 feet during the first second of its descent, it will, during the next, descend 4 times as much, or 64; during the third 9 times, or 144 feet; during the fourth 16 times, or 256, and so on.\n",
      "Such, then, is the great law of acceleration in regard to the spaces described. It is easily deducible also from numerical or algebraical considerations. Let the velocity, for example, at the end of any given time, such as a second, be denoted by 1; then in the second, third, and fourth, it will be 2, 3, 4, &c. But the space described at the end of any time is evidently equal to the time multiplied by the mean velocity; that is, the velocity at the half-interval. During the first second, therefore, the space described wifi be ⅛, during the second f, during the third f, during the fourth ½, and so on; adding these successively, the whole space from the beginning at the end of each interval will be ½, ½, ∣, 1 J 1 , &c., being each proportional to the square of the time. Algebraically again, if we suppose gravity to act only at the end of successive intervals, and the motion to continue uniform during these, then the spaces described will form an arithmetical progression, such as α, 2 a, 3 a, 4 α, 5 α, &c. ... n a, and the wħble space will be the sum of this series, or α + η a χ . =\n",

      "in extent and increased in number indefinitely, they will bear no sort of proportion to n- : the second term of the above sum therefore maybe neglected, and ultimately the whole space will be proportional to n a , the square of the time. In every view, then, this great, law is established; and when we come to try it experimentally, which is done by means of Atwood’s machine, it is confirmed by the nice\n",

      "Rector of the High School, Edinburgh, and author of several valuable works connected with Roman literature, was born on the 24th of June 1741, on a small farm which his father rented, not far from Forres, in Morayshire. He does not appear to have received any powerful direction to literary pursuits, either from the attainments of his parents or the ability of the parochial schoolmaster; but is referable to a class of men, of which Scotland can produce a very honourable list, whom the secret workings of a naturally active mind have raised above the level of their associates, and urged on to distinction and usefulness under the severest pressure of difficulties. The gentle treatment of an old schoolmistress first taught him to like his book; and this propensity induced his parents to consent that he should learn Latin. To the imperfect instruction which he received at the parish school, he joined indefatigable study at home, notwithstanding the scanty means and poor accommodation of his father’s house. Before he was sixteen, he had read the whole of Livy, in a copy of the small Elzevir edition, which he had borrowed from a neighbouring clergyman; omitting for the present all such passages as his own sagacity and Cole’s Dictionary did not enable him to construe. It was before day-break, during the mornings of winter, and by the light of splinters of boxwood dug out of an adjoining moss, that he prosecuted the perusal of this difficult classic; for, as the whole family were collected round the only fire in the evening, he was prevented by the noise from reading with any advantage; and the day-light was spent at school.\n",
      "In the autumn of 1757, he was a competitor for one of those bursaries, or small exhibitions, which are given by the university of Aberdeen to young men who distinguish themselves for their classical attainments; but as the prize was awarded to the best written exercises, and as Adam, with all his reading, had not yet been accustomed to write he was foiled by some youth who had been more fortunate in his means of instruction. About the same time Mr Watson, a relation of his mother’s, and one of the ministers of the Canongate, sent him a tardy invitation to come to Edinburgh, “provided he was prepared to endure every hardship for a season,”—a condition not likely to appal one who yet knew nothing of life but its hardships. The interest of Mr Watson procured him free admission to the lectures of the different professors; and as he had now also access to books in the College Library, his literary ardour made him submit with cheerfulness to the greatest personal privations. Eighteen months of assiduous application enabled him to repair the defects of his early tuition, and to obtain, after a. comparative trial of candidates, the head mastership of the foundation known by the name of Watson’s Hospital. At this period he was only nineteen, on which account the governors of the institution limited the appointment to half a year; but his steadiness and ability speedily removed their scruples. After holding the situation for three years, he was induced, by the prospect of having more leisure for the prosecution of his studies, to resign it, and become private tutor to the son of Mr Kincaid, a wealthy citizen, and afterwards Lord Provost of Edinburgh; and it was in consequence of this connection that he was afterwards raised to the office for which he was so eminently qualified. He taught in the High School, for the first time, in April 1765, as substitute for Mr Matheson the rector; in consequence of whose growing infirmities, an arrangement was made, by which he retired on a small annuity, to be paid from the profits of the class; and Mr Adam was confirmed in the rectorship on the 8th of June 1768.\n",
      "From this period the history of his life is little more than the history of his professional labours and of his literary productions. No sooner was he invested with the office, than he gave himself up with entire devotion to the business of his class, and the pursuits connected with it. For forty years his day was divided with singular regularity between the public duties of teaching and that unwearied research and industry in private which enabled him, amidst the incessant occupation of a High School master’s life, to give to the world such a number of accurate and laborious compilations. So entirely did these objects of public utility engross his mind, that he mixed but little with society, and considered every moment as lost that was not dedicated in some way or other to the improvement of youth. Few men certainly could adopt, with more truth and propriety, the language of Horace, both with regard to his own feelings and the objects on which he was occupied:\n",

      "The rector’s class, which in the High School is the most advanced of five, consisted of no more than between thirty and forty boys when Dr Adam was appointed. His celebrity as a classical teacher, joined to the progress of the country in wealth and population, continued to increase this number up to the year of his death. His class-list for that year contained 167 names,—the largest number that had ever been collected in one class, and, what is remarkable, equal to the amount of the whole five classes during the year when he first taught in the school.\n",
      "He performed an essential service to the literature of his country by introducing, in his own class, an additional hour of teaching for Greek and Geography; neither of which branches seems to have been contemplated in the original formation of the school. The introduction of Greek, which he effected a year or two after his election,' was regarded by some professors of the university as a dangerous innovation, and an unwarrantable encroachment on the province of the Greek chair; and the measure was accordingly resisted (though, it is satisfactory to think, unsuccessfully) by the united efforts of the Senatus Academicus, in a petition and representation to the towncouncil, drawn up and proposed by the celebrated Principal of the university, Dr Robertson. This happened in 1772.\n",
      "It is not possible for a man of principle and ordinary affections to be occupied in training a large portion of the youth of his country to knowledge and virtue, without feeling a deep responsibility, and a paramount interest in their progress and welldoing. That such were Dr Adam's feelings is proved, not less by the whole tenor of his life, than by his mode of conducting the business of his class; by the free scope and decided support he gave to talent, particularly when the possessor of it was poor and friendless; by the tender concern with which he followed his pupils into life; and by a test not the least unequivocal, the enthusiastic attachment and veneration which they entertain for his memory. In his class-room, his manner, while it imposed respect, was kindly and conciliating. He was fond of relieving the irksomeness of continued attention by narrating curious facts and amusing anecdotes. In the latter part of his life, he was perhaps too often the hero of his own tale; but there was something amiable even in this weakness, which arose from the vanity of having done much good, and was totally unmixed with any alloy of selfishness.\n",
      "Dr Adam’s first publication was his Grammar, which appeared in 1772. He had two principal objects in compiling it;—to combine the study of English and Latin grammar, so that they might mutually illustrate each other; and to supersede the preposterous method of teaching Latin by a grammar composed in that language, and of overloading ţhe memory with rules in Latin hexameters, for almost every fact and every anomaly in its grammatical structure. The change he proposed, reasonable as it was, could not be effected without running counter to confirmed prejudices, and interfering with established books. Although, therefore, the grammar met with the approbation of some eminently good judges, particularly of Bishop Lowth, the author had no sooner adopted it in his own class, and recommended it to others, than a host of enemies rose up against him, and he was involved in much altercation and vexatious hostility with the towncouncil and the four under masters. Dr George Stewart, then professor of humanity, was related to Ruddiman, whose grammar Dr Adam’s was intended to supersede; and to this cause may be traced the commencement of the determined opposition that was long made to any change. In these squabbles, the acrimony displayed by some of his adversaries now and then altered the natural suavity of Dr Adam’s temper; and his high notions of independence, and contempt of presumptuous ignorance, led him perhaps to neglect too much those easy arts of conciliation, which enable a man, without the slightest compromise of his integrity, “to win his way by yielding to the tide.”\n",

      "a distinguished statesman of the United States of North America. He was born on the 19th or (new style) 30th of October 1736, in that part of the township of Braintree, in Massachusetts, which on a subsequent division was called Quincey. His parents were of that class, then abounding in New England, who united the profession of agriculture with that of some one of the mechanic arts. His ancestor Henry had emigrated from Devonshire in the year 1632, and had established himself at Braintree with six sons, all of whom married: from one descended the subject of this memoir, and from another that Samuel Adams who, with John Hancock, was by name proscribed by an act of the British parliament, for the conspicuous part he acted in the early stages of the opposition to the measures of the mother country. When about 15 years of age, his father proposed to his son John either to follow the family pursuits, and to receive in due time, as his portion, a part of the estate which they had cultivated, or to have the expense of a learned education bestowed upon him, with which, instead of any fortune, he was to make his way in future life. The son chose the latter alternative; and having received some preparatory instruction, was admitted a student at Howard College in the year 1751. After passing about three years in that seminary, he removed to the town of Worcester, where, according to the economical practice of that day in New England, he became a tutor in a grammar school, and at the same time was initiated into the practice of the law in the office of Mr Putnam, then an attorney and a colonel of militia, and subsequently a general of some celebrity in the revolutionary war. A letter of Mr Adams, which has lately come before the public, written at the early age of 19, shows a degree of forecast which, like many other productions, may have led to its own accomplishment. It is dated 12th October 1755, and says, li Soon after the Reformation, a few people came over to this new world for conscience’ sake. Perhaps this apparently trivial incident may transfer the great seat of empire to America. It looks likely to me; for if we can remove the turbulent Gallic (the French in Canada), our people, according to the exactest computation, will in another century become more numerous than England itself. Should this be the case, sinee we have, I may say, all the naval stores of the nation in our hands, it will be easy to obtain the mastery of the seas; and then the united force of all Europe will not be able to subdue us. The only way to keep us from setting up for ourselves is to disunite us.”\n",
      "He was admitted to practice in the year 1758, and gradually rose to the degree of eminence which a local court can confer; and obtained distinction by some essays on the subject of the canon and feudal law, which were directed to point to the rising difference which commenced between the mother country and the colonies, soon after the peace of 1763 had delivered the latter from all disquietude respecting the establishments of France in the adjoining provinee of Canada. FIis character rose, both as a lawyer and a patriot, so as to induce Governor Barnard, who wished to gain him over to the royal party, to offer him the office of advocate-general in the Admiralty Court, which was deemed a sure step to the highest honours of the bench. Two years after, he was chosen one of the representatives of his native town to the congress of the province.\n",
      "His professional integrity was soon after exhibited in the defence of Captain Preston and some soldiers, who were tried before a Boston jury on a charge of murder. In this case Adams was counsel for the defence; and being considered by the people, then in an inflamed state against the troops, as a determined friend of liberty, his eloquence obtained a verdict of acquittal, without lessening his popularity.\n",
      "When it was determined, in 1774, to assemble a general congress from the several colonies, Mr Adams was one of those solicited for the purpose by the people of Massachusetts. Before departing for Philadelphia to join the congress, he parted with the friend of his youth, his fellow-student and associate at the bar, Jonathan Sewall, who had attained the rank of attorney-general, and was necessarily opposed to his political views. Sewall made a powerful effort to change his determination, and to deter him from going to the congress. Fie urged, that Britain was determined on her system, and was irresistible; and would be destructive to him and all those who should persevere in opposition to her designs. To this Adams replied: “I know that Great Britain has determined on her system, and that very fact determines më on mine. You know I have been constant and uniform in opposition to her measures; the die is now cast; I have passed the Rubicon; to swim or sink, live or die, survive or perish with my country, is my unalterable determination.” The conversation was then terminated by Adams saying to his friend, “I see we must part; and with a bleeding heart, I say, I fear for ever. But you may depend upon jt, this adieu is the sharpest thorn on which I ever set my foot.”\n",
      "When the continental congress was assembled, Mr Adams became one of its most active and energetic leaders. He was a member of that committee which framed the. declaration of independence, and one of the most powerful advocates for its adoption by the general body; and by his eloquence obtained the unanimous suffrages of that assembly. Though he was appointed chief justice in 1776, he declined the office, in order to dedicate his talents to the general purpose of the defence of the country.\n",
      "In 1777, he, with three other members, was appointed a commissioner to France. He remained in Paris about a year and a half, when, in conséquence of disagreements among themselves, in which Adams was not implicated, all but Franklin were recalled. In the latter end of 1779, he was charged with two commissions, one as a plenipotentiary to treat for peace, the other empowering him to form a commercial treaty with Great Britain. When arrived in Paris, the French government viewed with jealousy the purpose of the second commission; and Count de Vergennes advised him to keep it secret, with a view to prevail on the congress to revoke it. Mr Adams refused to communicate to the Count his instructions on that subject; and an altercation arose, from a claim made by France for a discrimination in favour of French holders of American paper money in the liquidation of it. The Count complained to congress, transmitted copies of Mr Adams’ letters, and instructed the French minister at Philadelphia to demand his recall. The demand was rejected, but afterwards four others were joined with him in the commission. Whilst these negotiations were in progress, he went to Holland, and there, in opposition to the influence and talents of the British minister, Sir Joseph Yorke, succeeded both in negotiating a loan, and in procuring the assistance of that country in the defence against Great Britain. He formed a commercial treaty with that republic, and joined in the ephemeral association called “the armed neutrality.”\n",
      "In 1785 Mr Adams was appointed ambassador to the court of his former sovereign, where his conduct was such as to secure the approbation of his own country, and the respect of that to which he was commissioned. Whilst in London, he published his work entitled Defence of the American Constitution, in which he combated ab!y the opinions of Turgot, Mably, and Price, in favour of a single legislative assembly; and thus perhaps contributed to the division of power and the checks on its exercise, which became established in the United States. At the close of 1787 he returned, after ten years devoted to the public service, to America. He received the thanks of congress, and was elected soon after, under the presidency of Washington, to the office of vice-president. In 1790 Mr Adams gave to the public his Discourses on Davila, in which he exposed the revolutionary doctrines propagated by France and her emissaries in other countries. On the retirement of Washington, the choice of president fell on Mr Adams, who entered on that office in May 1797. At that time the government was entangled by the insolent pretensions of the French demagogues, and by their partisans in many of the states. Great differences of opinion arose between the individuals at the head of affairs: one party, with Mr Hamilton at their head, was disposed to resist the pretensions of France by open hostilities; whilst Mr Adams was disinclined to war, so long as there was a possibility of avoiding it with honour. Owing to this division of his own friends, rather than to a want of public confidence, at the conclusion of the four years for which the president is chosen, Mr Adams was not re-elected. Perhaps this was in some measure owing to the preponderance of the slave states, in which Mr Jefferson, his rival, and a proprietor of slaves, had a fellow-feeling among the chief of the people.\n",
      "He retired with dignity at 68 years of age to his native place, formed no political factions against those in power, but publicly expressed his approbation of the measures which were pursued by him who had been his rival, who had become his successor in power, but had never ceased to be his firmly attached friend.\n",
      "The last public occasion on which Mr Adams appeared, was as a member of the convention for the revision of the constitution of Massachusetts, in which some slight alterations were requisite, in consequence of the province of Maine being separated from it.\n",
      "He seems to have enjoyed his mental faculties to the close of his protracted life; and even on the last day of it, two hours only before its final close, on the 4th July 1825, the fiftieth anniversary of the act of independence, he dictated to a friend, as a sentiment to be given at the public dinner of the day, ii Independence for ever.”\n",
      "Mr Adams was considered as a sound\n",
      "\n",
      "----\n",
      "the first of the human race, was formed by the Almighty on the sixth day of the creation. His body was made of the dust of the earth; after which, God animated or gave it life, and Adam then became a rational creature. His heavenly Parent did not leave his offspring in a destitute state to shift for himself, but planted a garden, in which he caused to grow not only every tree that was proper for producing food, but likewise such as were agreeable to the eye, or merely ornamental. In this garden were assembled all the brute creation, and, by their Maker, caused to pass before Adam, who gave all of them names, which were judged proper by the Deity himself.\n",
      "In this review Adam found none for a companion to himself. This solitary state was seen by the Deity to be attended with some degree of unhappiness, and therefore he threw Adam into a deep sleep, in which condition he took a rib from his side, and, healing up the wound, formed a woman of the rib he had taken out. On Adam’s awaking, the woman was brought to him; and he immediately knew her to be one of his own species, calling her his bone and his flesh, and giving her the name of woman, because she was taken out of man.\n",
      "The first pair being thus created, God gave them authority over the inferior creation, commanding them to subdue the earth, also to increase and multiply, and fill it They were informed of the proper food for the beasts and for them; the grass or green herbs being appointed for beasts, and fruits or seeds for man. Their proper employment also was assigned them; namely, to dress the garden and to keep it.\n",
      "Though Adam was thus highly favoured and instructed by his Maker, there was a single tree, which grew in the middle of the garden, of the fruit of which they were not allowed to eat; being told that they should surely die in the day they ate of it. This tree was named the Tree oj tlιe Knowledge of Good and Evil. This prohibition, however, they soon broke through. The woman having entered into conversation with the Serpent, was by him persuaded, that by eating of the tree she should become as wise as God himself; and accordingly, being invited by the beauty of the fruit, and its desirable property of imparting wisdom, she plucked and ate; giving her husband of it at the same time, who did likewise eat.\n",
      "Before this transgression of the divine command, Adam and his wife had no occasion for clothes, neither had they any sense of shame; but immediately on eating the forbidden fruit, they were ashamed of being naked, and made aprons of fig-leaves for themselves. On hearing the voice of God in the garden, they were terrified, and hid themselves: but being questioned by the Deity, they confessed what they had done, and received sentence accordingly; the man being condemned to labour, the woman to subjection to her husband, and to pain in childbearing. They were now driven out of the garden, and their access to it prevented by a terrible apparition.\n",
      "They had clothes given them by the Deity, made of the skins of beasts. In this state Adam had several children: the names of only three of whom we are acquainted with, viz. Cain, Abel, and Seth. He died at the age of 930 years.\n",
      "These are all the particulars concerning Adam that we have on divine authority; but there is a vast multitude oí others, all of them conjectural, part of them downright falsehoods or absurdities. The curiosity of our readers, it is presumed, will be sufficiently gratified by the few which are here subjoined.\n",
      "According to the Talmudists, when Adam was created, his body was of immense magnitude. When he sinned, his stature was reduced to a hundred ells, according tc some; to nine hundred, cubits, according to others; whc think this was done at the request of the angels, who were afraid of so gigantic a creature.\n",
      "According to the revelations of the famous Madame Bourignon, Adam before his fall possessed in himself the principles of both sexes, and the virtue or power of producing his like without the concurrent assistance of woman. The division into two sexes, she imagined,^[1. Preface to a book entitled Le Nouveau Ciel et La Nouvelle Terre , Amst. 1679. ] was the consequence of man’s sin; and now, she observes, mankind are become so many monsters in nature, being much less perfect in this respect than plants or trees, which are capable of producing their like alone, and without pain of misery. She even imagined, that being in an ecstasy, she saw the figure of Adam before he fell, with the manner how, by himself, he was capable of procreating other men. “God,” says she, “represented to my mind the beauty of the first world, and the manner how he had drawn it from the chaos: every thing was bright, transparent, and darted forth life and ineffable glory. The body of Adam was purer and more transparent than crystal, and vastly fleet; through his body were seen vessels and rivulets of light, which penetrated from the inward to the outward parts, through all his pores. In some vessels ran fluids of all kinds and colours, vastly bright, and quite diaphanous. The most ravishing harmony arose from every motion, and nothing, resisted or could annoy him. His stature was taller than the present race of men; his hair was short, curled, and of a colour inclining to black; his upper lip covered with short hair; and instead of the bestial parts which modesty will not allow us to name, he was fashioned as our bodies will be in the eternal life, which I know not whether I dare reveal. In that region his nose was formed after the manner of a face, which diffused the most delicious fragrancy and perfumes; whence also men were to issue, all whose principles were inherent in him; there being in his belly a vessel where little eggs were formed, and a second vessel filled with a fluid which impregnated those eggs; and when man heated himself in the love of God, the desire he had that other creatures should exist beside himself, to praise and love God, caused the fluid above mentioned (by means of the fire of the love of God) to drop on one or more of these eggs, with inexpressible delight; which being thus impregnated, issued, some time after, out of man by this canal,^[2. >i.e. the nasal canal situated as above described. ] in the shape of an egg,, whence a perfect man was hatched by insensible degrees. Woman was formed by taking out of Adam’s side the vessels that contained the eggs; which she still possesses, as is discovered by anatomists.”\n",
      "Many others have believed that Adam at his first creation was both male and female; others, that he had two bodies joined together at the shoulders, and their faces looking opposite ways, like those of Janus. Hence, say these, when God created Eve, he had no more to do than to separate the two bodies from one another. Of all others, however, the opinion of Paracelsus seems the most ridiculous.^[3. Paracelsus epud Vossium le Philoso phia . c. ix. p. 71. ] Negabat primos parentes ante lapsum habuisse partes generationi hominis necessarias; credebat postea accessisse, ut strumam gutturi.\n",
      "Extravagant things are asserted concerning Adam’s knowledge. Some rabbis, indeed, have contented themselves with equalling it to that of Moses and Solomon; but others have maintained that he excelled the angels themselves. Several Christians seem to be little behind these Jews in the degree of knowledge they ascribe to Adam; nothing being hid from him, according to them, except contingent events relating to futurity. One writer indeed (Pinedo) excepts politics; but a Carthusian friar, lιaving exhausted in favour of Aristotle every image and comparison he could think of, at last asserted that Aristotle’s knowledge was as extensive as that of Adam.\n",
      "In eonsequence of this surprising knowledge with which Adam was endued, he is supposed to have been a considerable author. The Jews pretend that he wrote a book on the Creation, and another on the Deity. Some rabbis ascribe the 92d psalm to him; and in some manuscripts the Chaldee title of this psalm expressly declares that this is the song of praise which the first man repeated for the Sabbath-day.\n",
      "Strange stories are told concerning Adam’s children. That he had none in the state of innocence, is certain from Scripture; but that his marriage with Eve was not consummated till after the fall, cannot be proved from thence. Some imagine, that, for many years after the fall, Adam denied himself the connubial joys by way of penance; others, that he cohabited with another woman, whose name was Lillith. The Mahometans tell us, that our first parents having been thrown headlong from the celestial paradise, Adam fell upon the isle of Ser-endib, or Ceylon, in the East Indies; and Eve on Iodda, a port of the Red Sea, not far from Mecca. After a separation of upwards of 200 years, they met in Ceylon, where they multiplied: according to some Eve had twenty, according to others only eight deliveries; bringing forth at each time twins, a male and a female, who afterwards married. The rabbis imagine that Eve brought forth Cain and Abel at a birth; that Adam wept for Abel a hundred years in the valley of tears near Hebron, during which time he did not cohabit with his wife; and that this separation would probably have continued longer, had it not been forbid by the angel Gabriel. The inhabitants of Ceylon affirm, that the salt lake on the mountain of Colombo consists wholly of the tears which Eve for one hundred years together shed because of Abel’s death.\n",
      "Some of the Arabians tell us, that Adam was buried near Mecca, on Mount Abukobeis; others, that Noah having laid his body in the ark, caused it to be carried after the deluge to Jerusalem, by Melchizedek, the son of Shem: of this opinion are the eastern Christians; but the Persians affirm that he was.interred in the isle of Seren-dib, where his corpse was guarded by lions at the time the giants warred upon one another. Some are of opinion that he was buried at Jerusalem, on the place where Christ suffered, that\n",

      "a celebrated naturalist, was descended from a Scotish family which had at the Revolution attached itself to the fortunes of the house of Stuart; and was born the 7th of April 1727 at Aix in Provence, where his father was in the service of Μ. de Vin-timille, then archbishop of that province. On the translation of this prelate to the archbishopric of Paris, about the year 1730, the elder Adanson also repaired thither, accompanied by his infant family of five children, all of whom were provided for by their father’s patron. A small canonry fell to the lot of our future naturalist, the revenue of which defrayed the expenses of his education at the college of Plessis. While there, he was distinguished for great quickness of apprehension, strength of memory, and mental ardour; but his genius took no particular bent, until he received a microscope from the celebrated Tuberville Needham, who happened to be present at one of the public examinations, and was struck with admiration of his talents and acquirements. „From the moment that young Adanson received this donation, to the last hour of his life, he persevered, with a zeal almost unexampled, in the observation and study of nature.\n",
      "On leaving college, his youthful ardour was well employed in the cabinets of Reaumur and Bernard de Jussieu, as well as in the Jardin des Plantes. Such was his zeal, that he repeated the instructions of the professors to such of his fellow-students as could not advance with a rapidity equal to his own; and before he had completed his 19th year, he had actually described (for his own improvement) four thousand species of the three kingdoms of nature. In this way he soon exhausted the rich stores of accumulated knowledge in Europe; and having obtained a small appointment in the colony of Senegal, he resigned his canonry, and embarked on the 20th of December 1748 for Africa.\n",
      "The motives which decided the choice of Senegal as the scene of his observations are recorded by himself, and are too remarkably indicative of his ardent thirst of knowledge not to be noticed. “It was,” says he, in a memorandum found after his death, “of all European establishments the most difficult to penetrate, the most hot, the most unhealthy, the most dangerous in every respect, and consequently the least known to naturalists.”\n",
      "His ardour remained unabated during the five years that he remained in Africa, in which period he collected and described an immense number of animals and plants; delineated maps of the country, and made astronomical observations; prepared grammars and dictionaries of the languages spoken on the banks of the Senegal; kept meteorological registers; composed a detailed account of all the plants of the country; and collected specimens of every object of commerce. Μ. Cuvier mentions that he had seen the produce and results of all these multifarious and laborious exertions.\n",
      "The situation in which Adanson was placed was admirably adapted to foster originality of genius; but it was also attended with every disadvantage that can arise from a want of comparison and rivalry. The collision of kindred intellects generally diminishes an overweening conceit; whilst entire seclusion from literary society as generally increases the presumption of genius, and renders errors familiar by long uncorrected repetition. To these causes, and to the secluded life which he continued to lead even after his return to Europe, may probably be traced some of the peculiar features of Adanson’s character. Thus, he chose to distinguish himself by a new system of orthography; and, instead of a simple and convenient nomenclature, he employed a set of arbitrary terms, whose etymology could not be traced, and the synonymes to which he rarely condescended to point out. He was opinionative in no small degree; and his vanity and self-confidencc too often led him to overlook or to undervalue the labours of those who were engaged in the same field of inquiry.\n",
      "Aboüt the period of Adanson’s return to Europe, which took place in 1754, natural history had undergone a very important revolution, from the valuable though widely differing labours of Buffon and Linnaeus. The one, giving loose to his imagination, pursued a path as seductive as beautiful; the other, entering with minute discrimination into every department, furnished a text-book to philosophers, leaving the splendid paintings of his eloquent rival to those who delight rather in brilliancy of colouring than in the chaste portraiture of nature. Both of these distinguished men, from too closely confining themselves to their individual views, appear to have in a great measure overlooked a most interesting branch of their subject, viz. the general relations of all beings, from which is deduced the division of them into families; which division is founded on their peculiar characters. This had formed an important branch of Adanson’s solitary reflections; and the boldness with which he developed his views soon attracted the admiration of naturalists. To appreciate thoroughly the value of his labours, it will be necessary to exhibit a rapid sketch of the general principles which influence natural arrangements, and the particular views entertained by Adanson.\n",
      "Every organized being is to be considered as an assemblage of parts, which by reciprocal actions produce certain effects. Between all of these parts a mutual dependence subsists, and no modification can be effected in any one member of the series, without sensibly affecting all the others in a greater or less degree. It is obvious that there can only be a certain number of possible combinations, which may be divided into two great classes, the primary and the subordinate.\n",
      "The first step towards the knowledge of these combinations would be an accurate acquaintance with all the actually existing organs. If this were attained, and if a complete view of all possible combinations were deduced, every organized being would be allotted to a determinate place, according to its organs; and there would be a correct systematic arrangement of all organic nature; every relation, every property, would be reducible to general laws; every function might be demonstrated; and natural history would become a precise science. Such, however, is only the ideal perfection at which we aim in attempting natural methods, to which we cannot expect the rapid advance fancied by some visionary theorists, but to which a steady perseverance, unclouded by preconceived prejudices, will ultimately enable us to approach.\n",
      "The most direct means of calculating the effects of the before-mentioned modifications would be, to determine the function and the influence of each organ. In this way, the great divisions might be made according to the most important organs, and the inferior would be naturally founded on the relations of the less important organs. A scale would thus be established, not less correct as regarding the order of nature, than if it had been formed subsequently to a full examination of all her works. This principle of classification has been named by some philosophers the subordination of characters. It is rational and philosophical, but its application presupposes an advancement in science far beyond that which existed at the period when Adanson commenced his labours. Accordingly, he adopted a more experimental method—that of a complete comparison of species; and the mode of applying his scheme is abundantly ingenious, and entirely his own.\n",
      "He founded his classification of all known organized beings on the consideration of each individual organ. As each organ gave birth to new relations, so he established a corresponding number of arbitrary arrangements. Those beings possessing the greatest number of similar organs were referred to one great division, and the relationship was considered more remote in proportion to the dissimilarity of organs.\n",
      "The chief defect of this method consists in presupposing a knowledge, not less difficult of attainment than the former, of species and their organization. It gives, however, distinct ideas of the degree of affinity subsisting between organized beings, independent of all physiological science. Of this universal method, as he called it, Adan-son gave some account in an essay contained in his Treatise on Shells, published at the end of his Voyage au Sénégal.\n",
      "Until the appearance of this work, the animals inhabiting shells had been much neglected. On this branch of his subject our author exercised his wonted zeal, while his methodical distribution, founded on not less than twenty of the partial classifications already alluded to, is decidedly superior to that of any of his predecessors. Like every first attempt, however, it had its imperfections, and these arose from not having examined the anatomical structure of the animals; from which cause he omitted, in his arrangement of the class of Mollusca, all molluscous animals without shells.\n",
      "His original plan was to have published the whole of the observations made during his residence at Senegal, in eight volumes; but being deterred by the difficulties attending so extensive a publication, he abandoned the scheme, and applied himself entirely to his Families of Plants, which he published in 1763. In this he found the application of his general principle not less advantageous than in his preceding works.\n",
      "The distribution of plants into natural families has attracted the notice of botanists since the middle of the seventeenth century. Bernard de Jussieu, the friend and instructor of Adanson, bestowed much attention on this subject; but, dissatisfied with his success, has left no other memorial of his labours than the arrangement which he introduced in the gardens of Trianon in 1758. Prompted by his own bold genius, as well as by the example of so distinguished a friend, Adanson undertook the task; and although he fell into errors which had been avoided by Jussieu, he executed it, upon the whole, with consummate ability.

      "a very eminent German grammarian, philologer, and general scholar, was born at Spantekow in Pomerania, on the 30th of August 1734. He acquired his elementary instruction at the public school of Ahclam, and that of Closterbergen, near Magdeburg, and completed his academical education at the university of Halle. In the year 1759 he was appointed professor at the gymnasium of Erfurt, but relinquished this situation two years after, and went to reside in a private capacity at Leipsic, where he continued to devote himself for a long period to the cultivation of letters, and particularly to those extensive and laborious philological researches which proved so useful to the language and literature of his native country. In 1787 he received the appointment of principal librarian to the elector of Saxony at Dresden, with the honorary title of Aulic Counsellor. Here he continued to reside during the remainder of his useful life, discharging with diligence and integrity the duties of his situation, and prosecuting his laborious studies to the last with indefatigable industry and unabated zeal. He died at Dresden on the 10th of September 1806, at the age of 72.\n",
      "The life of a mere scholar is generally destitute of interest; and that of Adelung, which was spent entirely in literary seclusion, presents no variety of incident to the pen of the biographer. Of his private character and habits few memorials have been preserved; but in these few he is represented as a man of an amiable disposition. He was never married. His constitution, which was remarkably robust, rendered him capable of the most intense and unremitted application to study, insomuch that, down to the period of his death, he is said to have devoted fourteen hours of every day to literary labour. He was a lover of good cheer, and spared neither pains nor expense in procuring a variety of foreign wines, of which his cellar, which he facetiously denominated his Bibliotheca Selectis-sima, is said to have contained no less than forty different kinds. His manners were easy and affable, and the habitual cheerfulness of his disposition rendered his society most acceptable to a numerous circle of friends.\n",
      "The works of Adelung are very voluminous; and there is not one of these, perhaps, which does not exhibit some proofs of the genius, industry, and erudition of the author. But although his pen was usefully employed upon a variety of subjects in different departments of literature and science, it is to his philological labours that he is principally indebted for his great reputation; and no man ever devoted himself with more zeal and assiduity, or with greater success, to the improvement of his native language.\n",
      "In a country which is subdivided into so many distinct sovereign states, possessing no common political centre, and no national institution whose authority could command deference in matters of taste,—in a «country whose indigenous literature was but of recent growth, and where the dialect of the people was held in contempt at the several courts,—it was no easy task for a single writer to undertake to fix the standard of a language which had branched out into a variety of idioms, depending in a great measure upon principles altogether arbitrary. Adelung effected as much in this respect as could well be accomplished by the persevering labours of an individual. By means of his excellent grammars, dictionary, and various works on German style, he contributed greatly towards rectifying the orthography, refining the idiom, and fixing the standard of his native tongue. Of all the different dialects, he gave a decided preference to that of the margraviate of Misnia, in Upper Saxony, and positively rejected every thing that was contrary to the phraseology in use among the best society of that province, and in the writings of those authors whom it had produced. In adopting this narrow principle, he is generally thought to have been too fastidious. The dialect of Misnia was undoubtedly the richest, as it was the earliest cultivated, of any in Germany; but Adelung probably went too far in restraining the language within the limits of this single idiom, to the exclusion of others, from which it might have, and really has, acquired additional richness, flexibility, and force.\n",
      "His dictionary of the German language is generally allowed to be superior to our English dictionary by Dr Johnson. It is eminently so in its etymologies; and is, perhaps, upon the whole, the best work of the kind of which any nation can boast. Indeed, the patient spirit of investigation which Adelung possessed in so remarkable a degree, together with his intimate knowledge of the ancient history and progressive revolutions of the different dialects from which the modern German is derived, rendered him peculiarly qualified for the successful performance of the duties of a lexicographer.\n",
      "It would greatly exceed our limits, and lead us into far too wide a field, were we to attempt to present our readers with an analysis of the r , several productions of this voluminous author; but we should do injustice to his memory, were we to pass over in total silence his last very learned work, entitled Mithridates, or a General History of Languages, with the Lord's Prayer, as a specimen, in nearly five hundred languages and dialects. The hint of tlιis work appears to have been taken from a publication, with a similar title, published by the celebrated Conrad Gesner in 1555; but the plan of Adelung is much more extensive. Unfortunately, he did not live to finish what he had undertaken; but the work has been continued with much ability by that eminent philologer, Professor Vater, formerly of Halle, now of Königsberg. The first volume, which contains the Asiatic languages, was published immediately after the death of Adelung; the second, which comprehends the European dialects, was published by Professor Vater in 1809; the first part of the third volume, which is almost entirely the work of the last-mentioned scholar, appeared in 1812. This third and last volume is to contain the languages of Africa and America, and will be enriched with some very valuable materials, communicated to the editor by Baron de Humboldt.\n",

      "eminent in the mathematics, and in natural philosophy, was bom at Rostock in Lower Saxony in 1724, and died at Dorpt in Livonia in 1802. We regret that our means of information do not enable us to communicate any particulars in regard to his personal history; but we shall give some account of his contributions to science; and these, after all, form the most interesting memorials of a philosopher’s life.\n",
      "The work by which he is best known is entitled Tentamen Theoriae Electricitatis et Magnetismi, published at Petersburg in 1759. It appeared under the sanction of the Imperial Academy, to which the theory had been in part communicated; and it is said on the title-page to be Instar Supplementi Comment. Acad. Petropolitanae. The work indeed merited this distinction, as being the first systematic and successful attempt to apply mathematical reasoning to the subjects of electricity and magnetism. Already the theory of Franklin with regard to the former was very generally received, and was supposed to afford a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena. But though it seemed sufficient for this purpose in the common and somewhat loose manner in which the matter had hitherto been treated, it was not certain that the same would hold when the conclusions were accurately and mathematically deduced. To apply this test was what AEpinus undertook, and what he has executed in a manner very satisfactory and complete. He has treated very fully, and perhaps has nearly exhausted, what may be called the statics of electricity and magnetism, or the equilibrium of their forces. A great field yet remains, where the motion of the electric fluid is to be considered, and its distribution over the surfaces of bodies of a given figure; where greater difficulties are to be encountered, and where the latest improvements of the integral calculus in the hands of Laplace and Poisson have begun to be applied. The investigations of AEpinus in their own department led to very satisfactory results, and the exact agreement between them and the phenomena actually exhibited was extensively observed. Notwithstanding this agreement, we cannot consider the theory of positive and negative electricity as being yet sufficiently established. Though the assumption on which it is founded appear very simple at first, it is found more complex on a nearer inspection. The assumption is, that a fluid resides in the surfaces of all the bodies termed electrics, which is highly elastic, and strongly attracted, at the same time, by the particles of the body; and that while this fluid remains equally diffused over the surface of the body, no phenomenon whatever gives any information of its existence. By certain mechanical operations, however, the equilibrium of this fluid maybe destroyed; the fluid may be accumulated at one end, or on one side of a body, and entirely withdrawn from the opposite. It is when an electric is brought into this state that it exhibits the phenomena of electricity, between which and the calculus instituted on the suppositions just laid down, AEpinus has everywhere remarked the most exact agreement. One great difficulty, however, still remains: the negative ends of two electrified bodies repel one another justas much as the ends which are reckoned positive. But such an effect cannot result from the mere absence of a substance: when the electric fluid is withdrawn, if repulsion still continue, it must arise from the mutual action of the particles of the body itself. Thus it would appear, that, in the absence of the electric fluid, the tendency of the particles of matter is to repel one another. This is an essential part of the theory; and it is not accurate to say, that the doctrine of Franklin or AEpinus supposes no more than the existence of an clastic fluid diffused over the surfaces, and strongly attracted by the particles, of bodies. It supposes, besides, that those particles, in the absence of this fluid, mutually repel one another. This not only takes away from the simplicity of the hypothesis, but it is obviously a very unnatural, not to say a contradictory supposition; because, when the electric matter is removed, how comes it to pass that the particles of the body, notwithstanding their mutual repulsion, still cohere together as firmly as before? This difficulty is acknowledged by AEpinus himself; but it would seem that the theory had taken a strong hold of his mind before he was aware of this consequence from it, so that he became by degrees reconciled to a supposition which appeared to him at first not a little incongruous. This must not surprise us: it is not always that, even among philosophers, we meet with the candour, or perhaps we should say the courage, with which Newton suspended his belief in his own great discovery, the principle of universal gravity, as long as the erroneous opinion then existing about the magnitude of the earth made the moon’s motion in her orbit appear inconsistent with the descent of falling bodies.\n",
      "Another remark, made by AEpinus himself, involves in it a difficulty which should have induced him to view his theory with considerable diffidence. Though he considers the difference of the two electricities to be the same as between excess and defect, or to consist in this, that the fluid which is deficient in the one part is in excess in the other, he admits that no phenomenon points out on which side the excess, or on which the defect lies. This is a strong indication that the difference is not of the kind supposed. We are not left at a loss to tell whether cold is the absence of a substance which we call heat, or heat the absence of a substance whieh we call cold. If there were just as much reason for asserting the one of these propositions as the other, one would certainly be inclined to reject both. The same should be done with respect to electricity and magnetism.\n",
      "The investigations of AEpinus, however, are by no means rendered useless, even if the s theory of positive and negative electricity, or of positive and negative magnetism, be exchanged for that of two elastic fluids, each attracting the other, and both attracted by the particles of bodies. Most of his investigations may be easily accommodated to tlιis supposition, and, therefore, they are, fortunately for themselves and for their author, of a more permanent nature than the principles from which they were deduced.\n",
      "It is to be added to this, that AEpinus was the first who saw the affinity between electricity and magnetism in its full extent, and perceived the light that these two mutually cast on one another. He instituted a regular series of experiments on the nature of the tourmaline, on which he wrote a small treatise, published in 1762. He is to be regarded also as the inventor of the condenser of electricity, and of the electrophorus, of which he gave the complete theory.\n",
      "A very excellent view of the theory of AEpinus was published at Parts by Μ. Haiiy in 1787, in 8vo. The same author has, however, adopted the theory of the two fluids in his own treatise, Leçons de Physique. There is a remarkable coincidence between AEpinus’s work on electricity and magnetism, and that of Mr Cavendish, given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1771, p. 584. The principles from which they set out, and the conclusions at which they arrive, are in a great measure the same. It appears, however, quite certain, that Mr Cavendish knew nothing of the work ofthe Russian philosopher till his own was completed. His mode of proceeding is more geometrical, and in some parts he has gone farther.\n",
      "The researches of AEpinus were not confined to the subjects now mentioned, but extended to most of the branches of natural philosophy. Beside the treatise on the tourmaline, he published, in 1762, a work, in 4to, On the distribution of heat at the surface of the earth ; a work which, though translated into French, has hardly, we believe, made its way into this country, and of which we are therefore unable to speak from our own knowledge. He is also the author of many valuable memoirs on different subjects in pure mathematics, in astronomy, mechanics, optics, meteorology, contained in the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th volumes of the Novi Commentarii Petro-politanae, and in the volumes of the Berlin Memoirs for 1755, 1756. In a memoir contained in the last of these, is the first account of his experiments on the tourmaline, which were conducted with great accuracy and judgment, and do honour to the author as a man of a sound and philosophical understanding, well instructed in the true principles of inductive investigation. Indeed, notwithstanding the objections we have made to his theories of electricity and magnetism, we must acknowledge that this is the general impression produced by the perusal of his works. He appears to have been well acquainted with practical astronomy, and sometimes to have had the charge of the imperial observatory. He made improvements on the micrometer and the reticulum, and wrote a memoir on the effects of parallax in the transit of a planet over the sun; a difficult subject, and one rendered at that time (1764) peculiarly interesting, on account of the transit of Venus which was just past, and that which was soon expected. (Novi Com. Pet. tom. x. p. 433.) In the same volume he has a memoir on the subject of accidental colours, which at that time had hardly been treated of by any author but Buffon; and another on the affinity between electricity and magnetism. In the 12th volume he notices, we believe for the first time, the electric property of the Brazilian emerald. He was not aware that this emerald is in reality the green tourmaline (Brogniart, tom. i. p. 418.); a variety of that mineral on which he had already exercised his ingenuity with so much success.\n",
      "It is rare, in an advanced state of science, to have the satisfaction of making a new discovery with regard to a subject quite elementary, and one that has been long a subject of attention. Thi\n",

      "d’, Chancellor of France, illustrious for his virtues, learning, and talents, was born at Limoges on the 27th of November 1668. His father, at that time intendant of Languedoc, and afterwards a counsellor of state, was a man of great worth and abilities. He seems to have taken the sole charge of his son’s education; and having destined him for the bar, he took uncommon pains to exercise him in every branch of ] knowledge which could contribute to his success in that profession. His care was rewarded with the happiest success. Young D’Aguesseau gave early indications of uncommon abilities; and such was his thirst for knowledge, and his habits of application, that he soon acquired the reputation of an almost universal scholar. He had a particular relish for poetry, which, he used to say, “was the only passion of his youth but this passion was so far from withdrawing him from severer studies, that it was allied in his mind with a nearly equal taste for mathematics. He studied law with the zeal of an antiquary, and the spirit of a philosopher; and, in order to form his taste as a pleader, he employed a.whole year in repeated perusals of the most esteemed productions of ancient eloquence. After this thorough course of preparation, he became an advocate in 1690; and, by the interest of his father, who then resided in Paris, he was soon furnished with opportunities of distinguishing himself, and of rising to the highest honours of the profession. When little more than 21 years of age, he was appointed one of the three Advocates· General, — an office which imposed the duty of assisting in those causes where the king, the church, or the public was concerned. The king, Louis XIV., in appointing him, yet untried, to this situation, acted solely upon the recommendation of the elder D’Aguesseau, “who was incapable,” said Louis, “of deceiving him, even to advance his own son.” D’Aguesseau’s first appearances as an advocate-general were such as amply to fulfil the expectations of his father, and to warrant the appointment which he had obtained from the king. Denis Talon, an old lawyer, who had long officiated with great reputation in the same capacity, was heard to say, that “he should have been glad to have finished his career as that young man had begun.”\n",
      "D’Aguesseau held this office for ten years, during which period he greatly distinguished himself, both for learning in his profession, and for a superior style of forensic eloquence. He was, indeed, one of the first reformers of the language of the French bar, which had not yet taken much polish from the national improvements in taste and literature. His diction, both in his pleadings and in his juridical compositions, was that of a mind expanded by a liberal course of study, and refined by a familiar acquaintance with classical models. The society which he chiefly frequented was also well adapted to improve his taste; for the chosen companions of his leisure hours were Racine and Boileau, the latter of whom has frequently mentioned him with praise in his writings.\n",
      "It was D’Aguesseau’s opinion, that no one could rise to distinguished eminence as an orator, who did not labour to enlarge his mind, and to improve his taste, by the study of philosophy and by exercises of literature; and he accordingly employed several of those stated Discourses, which the usages of France required from the advocatesgeneral at the opening of the Sessions, to impress these views upon the minds of the younger members of the bar. Such, in particular, was the object of the Discourse, pronounced in 1695, Sur Γ Union de la Philosophie et de l'Elo∙ quernee. The same subject is resumed at greater length, and in a more systematic manner, in a treatise, written at a later period, under the title of Instructions sur T Etude et les Exercises qui peuvent preparer aux Fonctions dl Avocat du Roi. These Pieces (OEuvres, tom. i.) are written in a clear, manly, and harmonious style, and are well worthy the attention of the general scholar, for their critical strictures on those authors whom he recommends to the students of law.\n",
      "In the year 1700 he was appointed Procurator-General ; an office of higher dignity, and of more various and extensive duties, than that of advocate-general. He filled this office for seventeen years with the most splendid reputation; adding, by his lenity in criminal cases, and by his care of the public hospitals, the praise of humanity and benevolence to his other claims to the respect and admiration of his countrymen. The political philosopher of the present day will probably, however, be inclined to question the justness of the encomiums bestowed upon his exertions during the severe scarcity of 1709; on which occasion he appears to have instituted the most rigorous proceedings against those who were held up as enemies of their country and of mankind, under the names of forestallers and monopolists. But, in alluding to this part of his conduct, it maybe proper tomention, that his opposition, at an after-period, to the delusive projects of the famous John Law, and his elaborate treatise upon the subject of Money ( OEuvres, tom. x.), afford undeniable proofs of the soundness of his views in regard to some of the most important doctrines of political economy.\n",
      "It had been early predicted of D’Aguesseau, that he would one day fill the place of Chancellor; and this prediction was at length realized in 1717, upon the death of Voisin, who then held the seals. Though he was yet only forty-eight years of age, his nomination to this high dignity gave general satisfaction, and was, indeed, intended as a popular measure by the duke of Orleans, who had lately assumed the regency. His brother Val-jouan, a man of abilities, but slothful and 'a humourist, was the only person who refused to congratulate him on the occasion. “Rather you than I, brother,” was his remark when the new chancellor hastened to him to announce his appointment. In fact, D’Aguesseau soon began to experience the difficulties and perils attendant upon his elevation; for he had not been installed above a year, when he was deprived of the seals, and exiled to his estate. His steady opposition to the extravagant projects of Law, with which the regent and his ministers were wholly intoxicated, was the honourable cause of this first reverse of fortune. In 1720, when the ruinous consequences of these schemes had filled the nation with distress and alarm, the chancellor was recalled from banishment; and he contributed not a little, by the firmness and sagacity of his counsels, to calm the public discontents, and repair the mischiefs which had been committed.\n",
      "Law himself had acted as the messenger of his recall; aud it is said that D’Aguesseau’s consent to re-accept the seals from the hand of this adventurer was much blamed by the literary corps, with which he had hitherto stood in high favour, as well as by the parliament. But his reputation appears to have sustained a much severer shock, when he endeavoured to prevail with the latter body to register the declaration of the late king in favour of the bull Unigenitus,— a measure which they held in great abhorrence, and which he had himself firmly opposed during the life of Louis. The regent's favourite, Dubois, then archbishop of Cambray, had moved his master to insist upon this act of registration, in the hope that he might thereby obtain a cardinal’s hat; and it seems to have been thought that the chancellor had yielded his better opinion in compliance with the wishes of this worthless minion. Be this as it may, it is certain that he op]>osed the favourite with firmness, when he attempted, after being made prime minister, to take precedence in the council; and he was in consequence, in 1722, sent a second time into exile.\n",
      "He now passed five years on his estate at Fresnes; and he always spoke with delight of this tranquil period, when he was left free from the cares of professional duty, and the distractions of public life, to cultivate his mind. The Scriptures, which he read and compared in various languages, and the Jurisprudence of his own and other countries, formed the subjects of his more serious studies: the rest of his time was devoted to philosophy and literature, and the improvement of his park, where he was sometimes to be seen employed with a spade.\n",
      "From these noble and congenial occupations he was again recalled, by the advice of Cardinal Fleury, in 1727; but the seals were not restored to him till ten years thereafter. During the intervening period he had endeavoured to mediate in the new disputes which had arisen between the court and the parliament; but his interference seems to have given satisfaction to neither party,—the one reproaching him with desertion from their cause, and the other with too great a leaning towards it. When the seals were at last restored to him, he completely withdrew from all affairs óf state, and devoted himself entirely to his duties as chancellor, and to the introduction of those reforms which had long occupied his inquiries and meditations.\n",
      "Besides some important enactments regarding Donations, Testaments, and Successions, he introduced various regulations for improving the forms of procedure, for ascertaining the limits of Jurisdictions, and for effecting a greater uniformity in the execution of the laws throughout the several provinces. These reforms constitute an epoch in the history of the jurisprudence of France, and have associated his name with those illustrious benefactors of her Civil Code, L’Hôpital and Lamoignon. The duke de Saint-Simon, however, alleges that the chancellor’s reforms did not go so far as they would have gone had he had less affection for his own order. He once, says this writer, confessed to a nobleman who spoke to him as to the propriety of cutting off certain lucrative abuses, that he could not bring his mind to a step which would so grievously diminish the profits of the law.\n",

      "In Saussure’s Voyages dans les Alpes is the following account of the two boys, at Chamouni, who have been called Albinos. “The elder, who was at the end of the year 1785 about 20 or 21 years of age, had a dull look, with lips somewhat thick, but nothing else in his features to distinguish him from other people. The other, who is two years younger, is rather a more agreeable figure; he is gay and sprightly, and seems not to want wit. But their eyes are not blue; the iris is of a very distinct rose colour: the pupil, too, when viewed in the light, seems decidedly red; which seems to demonstrate that the interior membranes are deprived of the uvea, and of that black mucous matter that should line them. Their hair, their eye-brows and eye-lashes, the down upon their skin, were all in their infancy of the most perfect milk-white colour, and very fine; but their hair is now of a reddish cast, and has. grown pretty strong. Their sight, too, is somewhat strengthened, though they exaggerate to strangers their aversion for the light, and half shut the eye-lids, to give themselves a more extraordinary appearance; but those who, like me, have seen them in their infancy, before they were tutored to this deceit, and when too few people came to Chamouni to make this affectation profitable to them, can attest that then they were not very much offended with the light of day. At that time they were so little desirous of exciting the curiosity of strangers, that they hid themselves to avoid such; and it was necessary to do a sort of violence to them before they could be prevailed on to allow themselves to be inspected. It is also well known at Chamouni, that when they were of a proper age they were unable to tend the cattle like the other children at the same age; and that one of their uncles maintained them out of charity, at a time of life when others were capable of gaining a subsistence by their labour.\n",
      "• “lam therefore of opinion, that we may consider these two lads as two albinos; for if they have not the thiek lips and flat noses of the white negroes, it is because they are albinos of Europe, not of Africa. This infirmity affects the eyes, the complexion, and the colour of the hair; it even diminishes the strength, but does not alter the conformation of the features. Besides, there arc certainly in this malady various degrees—some may have less strength, and be less able to endure the light; but these circumstances in those of Chamouni are marked with characters sufficiently strong to entitle them to the unhappy advantage of being classed with that variety of the human species denominated albinos.\n",
      "“When nature presents the same appearance often, and with circumstances varied, we may at last discover some general law, or some relation which that appearance has with known causes; but when a fact is so singular and so rare as that of those albinos, it gives but little seope to a conjecture; and it is very difficult to verify those by which we attempt to explain it.\n",
      "“I at first imagined that this disease might be referred to a particular sort of organic debility; that a relaxation of the lymphatic vessels within the eye might suffer the globules of the blood to enter too abundantly into the iris, die uvea, and even into the retina, whieh might occasion die redness of the iris and of the pupil. The same debility seemed also to account for the intolerance of the light, and for the whiteness of the hair.\n",
      "“But a learned physiologist, Μ. Blumenbaeh, professor in the university of Göttingen, who has made many profound observations on the organs of sight, and has considered with great attention the albinos of Chamouni, attributes their infirmity to a different eause.\n",
      "“The study of comparative anatomy has furnished him with frequent opportunities of observing this phenomenon; he has found it in brutes, in white dogs, and in owls; he says it is generally to be seen in the warm-blooded animals, but that he has never met with it in those with cold blood.\n",
      "“From his observations, he is of opinion that the redness of the iris, and of the other internal parts of the eye, as well as the extreme sensibility that accompanies this redness, is owing to the total privation of that brown or blackish mucus, which, about the fifth week after conception, covers all the interior parts of the eye in its sound state. He observes that Simon Pontius, in his treatise de Coloribus Oculorum, long ago remarked, that in blue eyes die interior membranes were less abundantly provided with this blaek mucus, and were therefore more sensible to the action of light This sensibility of blue eyes agrees very well, says Μ. Blumenbaeh, with northern people, during their long twilight; while, on the contrary, the deep black in the eyes of negroes enables them to support the splendour of the sunbeams in the torrid zone.\n",
      "“As tò the connection between this red colour of their eyes and the whiteness of the skin and hair, the same learned physiologist says, that it is owing to a similarity of structure, consensus ex similitudine fabricae. He asserts that this blaek mucus is formed only in the delicate cellular substance, whieh has numerous blood-vessels contiguous to it, but contains no fat, like the inside of the eye, the skin of negroes, the spotted palate of several domestic animals, &c. And, lastly, he says that the colour of the hair generally corresponds with that of the iris. (Gazette Litt, de Gottingue, Oct. 1784.)\n",
      "“At the very time that Μ. Blumenbaelι was reading this memoir to the Royal Society of Göttingen, Μ. Buzzi, surgeon to the hospital at Milan, an élève of the celebrated anatomist Moscati, published in the Opuscoli Scelti de Milan, 1784, tom. vii. p. 11, a very interesting memoir, in whieh he demonstrates by dissection what Blumenbach had only supposed.\n",
      "“A peasant of about 30 years of age died in the hospital of Milan of a pulmonary disorder. His body being exposed to view, was exceedingly remarkable by the uncommon whiteness of the skin, of the hair of the beard, and of all the other covered parts of the body. Μ. Buzzi, who had long desired an opportunity of dissecting such a subject, immediately seized upon this. He found the iris of the eyes perfectly white, and the pupil of a rose eolour. The eyes were dissected with the greatest possible eare, and were found entirely destitute, of that black membrane which anatomists eall the uvea; it was not to be seen either behind the iris or under the retina. Within the eye there was only found the choroid coat, extremely thin, and tinged of a pale red colour, by vessels covered with discoloured blood. What was more extraordinary, the skin, when detached from different parts of the body, seemed almost entirely divested of the rete mucosum; maceration did not discover the least vestige of this, not even in the wrinkles of the abdomen, where it is most abundant and most visible.\n",
      "“Μ. Buzzi likewise accounts for the whiteness of the skin and of the hair, from the absence of the rete mucosum, which, according to him, gives.the colour to the euticle, and to the hairs that are scattered over it. Among other proofs of this opinion, he alleges a well-known fact, that if the skin of the blackest horse be accidentally destroyed in any part of the body, the hairs that afterwards grow on that part are always white, because the rete mucosum which tinges those hairs are never regenerated with the skin.\n",
      "“The proximate cause of the whiteness of albinos, and the colour of their eyes, seems therefore pretty evidently to depend on the absence of the rete mucosum ; but what is the remote cause?\n",
      "“In the first place, it seems probable that men affected with this infirmity form no distinct spceies, for they are produced from parents that have dark skins and blaek eyes. What is it then that destroys the rete mucosum in such persons? Μ. Buzzi relates a singular faet, which seems to throw some light on this subject.\n",
      "“A woman of Milan, called Caleagni, had seven, sons. The two oldest had brown hair and blaek eyes; the three next had white skins, white hair, and red eyes; the two last resembled the two eldest. It was said that this woman, during the three pregnancies that produced the albinos, had a continual and immoderate appetite for milk, whieh she took in great quantities; but that when she was with child of the other four children, she had no such desire. It is not, however, ascertained that this preternatural appetite was not itself the. effect of a certain heat, or internal disease, which destroyed the rete mucosum in the children before they were born.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The albinos of Chamouni are also the offspring of parents with dark skins and black eyes. They have three sisters by the same father and mother, who are also brunettes. ' One of them that I saw had the cyes of a dark brown, and the hair almost black. They are said, however, to be all afflicted with a weakness of sight. When the lads are married, it will be curious to observe how the eyes of their children will be formed. The experiment would be particularly decisive if they were married to women like themselves. But this faulty conformation seems to be more rare among women than among men; for the four of Milan, the two of Chamouni, the one described by Mau-pertuis, the one by Helvetius, and almost all the instances of these singular productions, have been of our sex. It is known, however, that there are races of men and women affected with this disease, and that these races perpetuate themselves in Guinea, in Java, at Panama, &c.\n",
      "“Upon the whole, this degeneration docs not seem to be owing to the air of the mountains; for though I have traversed the greatest part of the Alps, and the other mountains of Europe, these are the only indivi\n",

      "le Rond d’, an eminent French philosopher, was born at Paris in 1717. He derived the name of Jean le Rond from that of the church near which, after his birth, he was exposed as a foundling. His father, informed of this circumstance, listened to the voice of nature and duty, took measures for the proper education of his child, and for his future subsistence in a state of ease and independence.\n",
      "He received his first education in the College of the Four Nations, among the Jansenists, where he gave early marks of capacity and genius. In the first year of his philosophical studies he composed a Commentary on the Epistle of St Paul to the Romans. The Jansenists considered this production as an omen that portended to the party of Port-Royal a restoration to some part of their ancient splendour, and hoped to find one day in Μ. d’Alembert a second Pascal. To render this resemblance more complete, they engaged their rising pupil in the study of the mathematics; but they soon perceived that his growing attachment to this science was likely to disappoint the hopes they had formed with respect to his future destination: they therefore endeavoured to divert him from this line; but their endeavours were fruitless.\n",
      "On his leaving college, he found himself alone and unconnected with the world; and sought an asylum in the house of his nurse. He comforted himself with the hope that his fortune, though not ample, would better the condition and subsistence of that family, which was the only one that he could consider as his own. Here, therefore, he took up his residence, resolving to apply himself entirely to the study of geometry; and here he lived, during the space of forty years, with the greatest simplicity, discovering the augmentation of his means only by increasing displays of his beneficence, concealing his growing reputation and celebrity from these honest people, and making their plain and uncouth manners the subject of good-natured pleasantry and philosophical observation. His good nurse perceived his ardent activity, heard him mentioned as the writer of many books, but never took it into her head that he was a great man, and rather beheld him with a kind of compassion. “ You will never,\" said she to him one day, “ beany thing but a philosopher — and what is a philosopher ? — a fool, who toils and plagues himself during his life, that people may talk of him when he is NO MORE.”\n",
      "As Μ. d’Alembert’s fortune did not far exceed the demands of necessity, his friends advised him to think of a profession that might enable him to augment it. He ao∙ cordingly turned his views to the law, and took his degrees in thát line; but soon abandoned this plan, and applied to the study of medicine. Geometry, however, was always drawing him back to his former pursuits; and after many ineffectual efforts to resist its attractions, he renounced all views of a lucrative profession, and give himself over entirely to mathematics and poverty.\n",
      "In the year 1741 he was admitted member of the Academy of Sciences; for which distinguished literary promotion, at such an early age, he ħad prepared the way by correcting the errors of a celebrated work,^[1. The Analyse Démontrée of F. Beniau. ] which was deemed classical in France in the line of geometry. He afterwards set himself to examine, with deep attention and assiduity, what must be the motion of a body which passes from one fluid into another more dense, in a direction not perpendicular to the surface separating the two fluids. Every one knows the phenomenon which happens in this case, and which amuses children under the denomination of Ducks and Drakes ; but Μ. d’Alembert was the first who explained it in a satisfactory and philosophical manner.\n",
      "Two years after his election to a place in the academy he published his treatise on Dynamics. The new principle developed in this treatise consisted in establishing equality, at each instant, between the changes that the motion of a body has undergone, and the forces or powers which have been employed to produce them; or, to express the thing otherwise, in separating into two parts the action of the moving powers, and considering the one as producing alone the motion of the body in the second instant, and the other as employed to destroy that which it had in the first.\n",
      "So early as the year 1744, Μ. d’Alembert had applied this principle to the theory of the equilibrium, and the motion of fluids; and all the problems before solved by geometricians became in some measure its corollaries. The discovery of this new principle was followed by that of a new calculus, the first trials of which were published in a Discourse on the General Theory of the Winds, to which the prize-medal was adjudged by the academy of Berlin in the year 1746, and which was a new and brilliant addition to the fame of Μ. d’Alembert.\n",
      "He availed himself of the favourable circumstance of the king of Prussia having just terminated a glorious campaign by an honourable peace, and in allusion to this, dedicated his work to that prince in the three following Latin verses :—\n",
      "Hoec ego de ventis, dum ventorum ocyor alis\n",
      "Palantes agit Αustriacos Frcdericus, et orbi,\n",
      "Insignis lauro, ramum proetendit olivee.\n",
      "Swifter than wind, while of the winds I write,\n",
      "The foes of conquering Frederick speed their flight;\n",
      "While laurel o’er the hero’s temple bends,\n",
      "To the tir’d world the olive branch he sends.\n",
      "This flattering dedication procured the philosopher a polite letter from Frederick, and a place among his literary friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "In thé year 1747 D’Alembert applied his new calculus of Partial Differences to the problem of vibrating chords, the solution of which, as well as the theory of the oscillation of the air and the propagation of sound, had been given but incompletely by the geometricians who preceded him, and these were his masters or his rivals.\n",
      "In the year 1749 he furnished a method of applying his principles to the motion of any body of a given figure; and he solved the problem of the precession of the equinoxes, determined its quantity, and explained the phenomenon of the nutation of the terrestrial axis, discovered by Dr Bradley.\n",
      "In 1752 Μ. d’Alembert published a treatise on the Resistance of Fluids, to which he gave the modest title of an Essay, but which contains a multitude of original ideas and new observations. About the same time he published, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berl in, Researches concerning the Integral Calculus, which is greatly indebted to him for the rapid progress it has made in the present century.\n",
      "While the studies of Μ. d’Alembert were confined to geometry, he was little known or celebrated in his native country. His connections were limited to a small society of select friends: he had never seen any man in high office except Messrs d’Argenson. Satisfied with an income which furnished him with the necessaries of life, he did not aspire after opulence or honours, nor had they been hitherto bestowed upon him, as it is easier to confer them on those who solicit them, than to look out for men who deserve them. His cheerful conversation, his smart and lively sallies, a happy knack at telling a story, a singular mixture of malice of speech with goodness of heart, and of delicacy of wit with simplicity of manners, rendered him a pleasing and interesting companion; and his company, consequently, was much sought after in the fashionable circles. His reputation at length made its way to the throne, and rendered him the object of royal attention and beneficence. He received also a pension from government, which he owed to the friendship of Count d’Argenson.\n",
      "The tranquillity of Μ. d’Alembert was abated when his fame grew more extensive, and when it was known beyond the circle of his friends, that a fine and enlightened taste for literature and philosophy accompanied his mathematical genius. Our author’s eulogist ascribes to envy, detraction, and to other motives equally ungenerous, all the disapprobation, opposition, and censure that Μ. d’Alembert met with on account of the publication of the famous Encyclopedical Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, in conjunction with Diderot. None surely will refuse the well-deserved tribute of applause to the eminent displays of genius, judgment, and true literary taste, with which Μ. d’Alembert has enriched the great work now mentioned. Among others, the Preliminary Discourse which he has affixed to it, concerning the rise, progress, connections, and affinities of all the branches of human knowledge, is perhaps one of the first productions of which the philosophy of the present age can boast, and will be regarded as a striking specimen of just arrangement and sound criticism, and also as a model of accurate thinking and elegant writing.\n",
      "Some time after this D’Alembert published his Philosophical, Historical, and Philological Miscellanies. These were followed by the Memoirs of Christina, Queen of Sweden, in which Μ. d’Alembert showed that he was acquainted with the natural rights of mankind, and was bold enough to assert them. His Essay on the Intercourse of Men of Letters with Persons high in Rank and Office wounded the former to the quick, as it exposed to the eyes of the public the ignominy of those servile chains which they feared to shake off or were proud to wear. A lady of the court hearing one day the author accused of having exaggerated the despotism of the great, and the submission they require, answered slyly, If he had consulted me, I would have told him still more of the matter.\n",
      "Μ. d’Alembert gave very elegant specimens of his literary abilities in his translations of some select pieces of Tacitus. But these occupations did not divert him from his mathematical studies; for about the same time he enriched the Encyclopédie with a multitude of excellent articles in that line, and composed his Researchesοη several important points of the System of the World, in which he carried to a higher degree of perfection the solution of the problem of the\n",

      "a town of Syria, the capital of a pachalic, of which the limits are not exactly defined, is situated in the vast plain which extends from the Orontes to the Euphrates, and which towards the south terminates in the desert. It is built on eight hills or eminences, and is intersected by the Kowick, which in winter swells into a large stream, overflowing its bridges, and the neighbouring gardens which cover its banks. This river terminates 18 miles beyond Aleppo, in a morass which is haunted by wild boars and pelicans. The city itself is above 3½ miles in circumference, and is surrounded by an ancient strong stone-wall and ditch. Including the suburbs, the city is about 7 or 8 miles in compass. The wall is flanked by frequent towers; but the ditch is partly filled up with rubbish or occupied by kitchen-gardens, and the city being commanded by the adjacent heights, is entirely indefensible. The town has nine gates, all known by different names. On one of the hills on which the city is built, and on its north-east corner, is a castle seated on a mount. This mount is of a conic form, which seems in a great measure to be raised with the earth thrown up out of a deep broad ditch which surrounds it. The castle is entered from the south by a bridge of seven lofty narrow arches thrown over the ditch, on which are two gates fortified by turrets, and two more still higher on the hill. Aleppo is esteemed the fourth city of the Ottoman empire, only exceeded by Constantinople, Cairo, and Damascus. It appeared to Mr Buckingham, who visited it in 1816, to be one of the best built of all the cities in the East that he had seen. In the regularity of the streets, the aspect of the houses, and also in cleanliness, it was decidedly superior to the generality of Turkish towns. The houses are large and commodious, having terraces on their tops, on which the inhabitants sleep in summer, and generally sky-lights in form of a dome to let the light into the rooms, which, from their loftiness, the gilding on the window-shutters, cupboard doors, &c. have at first entrance a very grand and agreeable effect. They are all so equal in height, that there are seldom any steps to ascend or descend in going from one house to another; while several large vaulted streets increase the facility of communication, by affording a passage to every part of the city free from the embarrassment of the open streets. They are carefully paved, have two commodious footpaths, six inches high on each side, and the middle of the street is laid with brick, the small end upwards, for the convenience of the horses.\n",
      "The mosques in Aleppo are numerous, and seven or eight of them are considered handsome, though none has more than a single minaret or steeple. They are built of freestone, with a dome in the middle, which is covered with lead. The members of the Greek, Arminian, Syrian, and Maronite communions have each a church; and the Europeans formerly had four small convents; but in 1807 there was only one, containing nine Italian monks. Before each of them is an area, with a fountain in the middle, designed for ablutions before prayers; and behind some of the larger there are little gardens. There are about twenty large khans or caravansaries, consisting of a capacious square, on all sides of which are rooms, built on the groundfloor, used occasionally for chambers, warehouses, or stables. Above stairs there is a colonnade or gallery on every side,  in which are the doors of a number of small rooms, wherein the merchants, as well strangers as natives, transact most of their business. Numerous coffee-houses are seen in all parts, some large and handsome, with a fountain in the middle, and a gallery for musicians. They are greatly frequented, and by persons of the highest rank.\n",
      "The bazars or market-places are long, covered, narrow streets, on each side of which is a great number ∙of small shops, just sufficient to hold the tradesman and his goods, the buyer being obliged to stand without. Each separate branch of business has a particular bazar, which is locked up, as well as the streets, an hour and a half after sunset. This city is in itself one of the most agreeable in Syria, and is a trading and bustling place; and, owing to the great resort of Europeans, is considered by Mr Buckingham tobe more than 100 years in advance of the other parts of Syria. On whatever side it is approached, its numerous minarets and domes present an agreeable prospect to the eye, fatigued with the continued sameness of the brown and parched plains. In the centre is an artificial mountain surrounded by a dry ditch, on which is a ruinous fortress. From hence we have a fine prospect of the whole city. To the north we discover the snowy mountains of Bailan, and on the west those which separate the Orontes from the sea, while to the south and east the eye can see as far as the Euphrates. In the time of Omar this castle stopped the progress of the Arabs for several months, and was at last taken by treachery; but at present it would not be able to resist the feeblest assault. Its slight wall, low and without a buttress, is in ruins; its little old towers are in no better condition; and it has not four cannons fit for service, not excepting a culverine nine feet long, taken from the Persians at the siege of Bassora. Three hundred and fifty janizaries, who should form the garrison, are busy in their shops. Within the walls of the castle is a well, which, by means of a subterraneous communication, derives its water from a spring a league and a quarter distant. In the environs of the city we find a number of large square stones, on the top of which is a turban of stone, which are so many tombs. Aleppo maybe considered the emporium of Armenia and Diarbekir. Four caravans annually proceed through Natolia to Constantinople, and others arrive from Bagdad and Bassora with coffee from Mocha, and with muslins, shawls, and other goods from India. Caravans are sent also to Medina and Mecca, with which places a regular intercourse is maintained. The commerce with Europe is principally carried on from Scanderoon and Latakia, on the sea-coast. The chief commodities exported are, raw or spun cottons, clumsy linens fabricated in the villages, silk stulfs manufactured in the city, copper, bourres (coarse cloths)like those of Rouen, goats’ hair brought from Natolia, the gall-nuts of the Kourdistan, the merchandise of India, and pistachio-nuts of the growth of the neighbourhood. The articles supplied by Europe are cloths, Lyonese stuffs, and bonnets after the fashion of Tunis from France; merceries, indigo, tea, sugar, paper, soap, &c.; and a great quantity of coral ornaments. The coffee of America, though prohibited, is introduced, and serves to mix with that of Mocha. British, French, Dutch, and Italian houses are established at Aleppo, for the purposes of trade; and most of the European states have consuls resident here. Aleppo is not exceeded in extent by any city in Turkey, except Constantinople and Cairo, and perhaps Smyrna. It is difficult to make any estimate of its population, but it is said to be increasing, and, according to the most authentic computation, does not probably contain less than 250,000 inhabitants. Of these, 30,000 are Christians, who enjoy the most perfect toleration, and are treated with more respect than in any town of the East.\n",
      "The air of Aleppo is dry and piercing, bùt at the same time salubrious for all who are not troubled with asthmatic complaints. The city, however, and the environs, are subject to a singular endemial disorder, which is called the ringworm or pimple of Aleppo: it is in fact a pimple which is at first inflammatory, and at length becomes an ulcer of the size of the nail. The usual duration of this ulcer is one year: it commonly fixes on the face, and leaves a scar, which disfigures almost all the inhabitants. No reason is assigned for this malady; but Μ. Volney suspects it proceeds from the quality of the water, as it is likewise frequent in the neighbouring villages, in some parts of Diarbekir, and even in certain districts near Damascus, where the soil and the water have the same appearances. But the plague is a more destructive malady, a visitation of which is anticipated by the inhabitants every ten years. Its ravages are most fatal, owing to the blind fatalism of the Turks, who cannot be persuaded to take any precautions against the progress of this dreadful disease. In the plague which immediately preceded the year 1797, about 60,000 inhabitants were swept off. Of the Christian inhabitants the greater number are Greeks, next to them the Armenians, then the Syrians, and lastly the Maronites; each of whom has a church in the city called Judida; in which quarter, and the parts adjacent, most of them reside. The common language is the vulgar Arabic, but the Turks of condition use the Turkish. Most of the Armenians can speak the Armenian, some few Syrians understand Syriac, and many of the Jews Hebrew; but scarcely one of the Greeks understands a word of Greek. The people in general are of a middle stature, and tolerably well proportioned; but they seem neither vigorous nor active. Both sexes are handsome when young; but the women, as tlιey come early to maturity, also fade very soon. The people of rank here are polite and affable, making allowances for that superiority which the Mahometan religion instructs its votaries to assume over all who hold a different faith. All the inhabitants of both sexes smoke tobacco to great excess; even the very servants have almost constantly a pipe in their mouth. Coaches or carriages are not used here; therefore persons of quality ride on horseback in the city, with a number of servants walking before them, according to their rank. Ladies of the first distinction are even compelled to walk on foot in the city, or to any place at a moderate distance: in longer journeys they are carried by mules, in a kind of couch close covered up.

      "It now presents little more than half-ruined houses and rubbish, with a few fragments of those magnificent edifices by which it was once adorned. The estimates of its population have fluctuated remarkably, varying between 5000 and 20,000. Mr Madden, to whom we owe the most recent account (Travels in Turkey, 1829), states the number at 16,000, of whom 9000 are Arabs, 2000 Greeks, 2000 Franks (Europeans); the rest Jews, Copts, &c. The commerce of Alexandria is still extensive, as almost all the commodities imported into and exported from Egypt pass through its port. Both the British and French nations maintain consuls at Alexandria, and of the former nation there are nine considerable mercantile houses established there. The ‘Jewish merchants are also numerous and wealthy; for, though subject to heavier impositions, they carry on their traffic with such economy, and have such a friendly understanding with the collectors of the customs, that they generally undersell Europeans. The late extensive exportation of cotton from Egypt has given an increased importance to Alexandria, and a considerable stir has been created by the naval expeditions equipped there by the pacha.\n",
      "The present city is a kind of peninsula situated between the two ports. That to the westward was called by the ancients the Portus Eunostos, now the old port, and is by far the best; Turkish vessels only are allowed to anchor there: the other, called the new port, is for the Christians; at the extremity of one of the arms of which stood the famous Pharos. The new port, the only harbour for Europeans, is clogged up with sand, insomuch that in stormy weather ships are liable to bilge; and the bottom being also rocky, the cables soon chafe and part; so that one vessel driving against a second, and that against a third, they are perhaps all lost. Of this there was a fatal instance many years ago, when 42 vessels were dashed to pieces on the mole in a gale of wind from the north-west; and numbers have been since lost there at different times. If it be asked in Europe, why do they not repair the new port? the answer is, that in Turkey they destroy every thing, and repair nothing. The old harbour will be destroyed likewise, as the ballast of vessels has been continually thrown into it for the last 200 years. The spirit of the Turkish government is to ruin the labours of past ages, and destroy the hopes of future times, because ignorant despotism never considers tomorrow.\n",
      "The country round Alexandria is entirely destitute of water. This must be brought from the Nile by the kalidj, or canal of 12 leagues, which conveys it thither every year at the time of the inundation. It fills the vaults or reservoirs dug under the ancient city, and this provision must serve till the next year. It is evident, therefore, that were a foreign power to take possession, the canal would be shut, and all supplies of water cut off. It is this canal alone which connects Alexandria with Egypt; for, from its situation without the Delta, and the nature of the soil, it really belongs to the deserts of Africa. Its environs are sandy, flat, and sterile, without trees and without houses; where we meet with nothing but the plant which yields the kali, and a row of palm-trees, which follows the course of the kalidj or canal. The famous tower of Pharos has long since been demolished, and a castle, called Farillon, built in its place. The causeway which joined the island to the continent is broken down, and its place supplied by a strong bridge of several arches.\n",
      "Some parts of the old walls of the city are yet standing, and present a fine specimen of ancient masonry. They are flanked with large towers, about 200 paces distant from each other, with small towers in the middle. Below are magnificent casemates, which may serve for galleries to walk in. In the lower part of the towers is a large square hall, the roof of which is supported by thick columns of Thebaic stone. Above are several rooms, over which are platforms more than 20 paces square. The ancient reservoirs, vaulted with so much art, which extend under the whole town, remain almost entire at the end of 2000 years.\n",
      "Of Caesar’s palace there remain only a few porphyry pillars, and the front, which is almost entire, and very beautiful. The palace of Cleopatra was built upon the walls facing the port, having a gallery on the outside, supported by several fine columns. Not far from this palace are two obelisks, vulgarly called Cleopatra’s Needles. They are of Thebaic stone, and covered with hieroglyphics. One is overturned, broken, and lying under the sand; the other is on its pedestal. These two obelisks, each of which is a single stone, are about 60 feet high, by seven feet square at the base. Denon, who went to Egypt along with the French army in 1798, supposed that these columns decorated the entrance of the palace of the Ptolemies, the ruins of which still exist at no great distance from the place of the obelisks. Towards the gate of Rosetta are five columns of marble, on the place formerly occupied by the porticoes of the gymnasium. The rest of the colonnade, the design of which was discoverable 100 years ago by Maillet, has since been destroyed by the barbarism of the Turks.\n",
      "But what most engages the attention of travellers is the pillar of Pompey, as it is commonly called, situated at a quarter of a league from the southern gate. It is composed of red granite. The capital, which is Corinthian, with palm leaves, and not indented, is nine feet high. The shaft and the upper member of the base are of one piece of nearly 90 feet long and nine in diameter. The base is a square of about 15 feet on each side. This block of marble, 60 feet in circumference, rests on two layers of stone bound together with lead; which, however, has not prevented the Arabs from forcing out several of them, to search for an imaginary treasure. The whole column has been said to be 117 feet high, but the most recent and careful estimates do not make it exceed 95. It is perfectly well polished, and only a little shivered on the eastern side. Nothing can equal the majesty of this monument; seen from a distance, it overtops the town, and serves as a signal for vessels. On a nearer approach, it produces an astonishment mixed with awe. One can never be tired with admiring the beauty of the capital, the length of the shaft, or the extraordinary simplicity of the pedestal. This last has been somewhat damaged by the instruments of travellers, who are curious to possess a relic of this antiquity. The column was considered inaccessible, till it was scaled about half a century ago by the wild frolic of a party of English sailors, who conceived the project, of emptying a bowl of punch on the top of this celebrated monument. Dexterously availing themselves of the movements of a paper kite, they succeeded in fastening a rope to the summit, by which they ascended, and performed this great achievement. They discovered a foot and ancle, the only remnant of a gigantic statue which had originally adorned it. It has since been rendered more accessible; and Mr Madden mentions an English lady who breakfasted and wrote a letter from this elevated position.\n",
      "Learned men and travellers have made many fruitless attempts to discover in honour of what prince it was erected. The best informed have concluded that it could not be in honour of Pompey, since neither Strabo nor Diodorus Siculus has spoken of it. The Arabian Abul-feda, in his Description of Egypt, calls it the Pillar of Severus. And history informs us that this emperor visited the city of Alexandria. Denon, on this subject, expresses himself as follows:—“After having observed that the column is very chaste both in style and execution; that the pedestal and capital are not formed of the same granite as the shaft; that their workmanship is heavy, and appears to be merely a rough draught; and that the foundations, made up of fragments, indicate a modern construction ÿ—it may be concluded that this monument is not antique, and that it may have been erected, either in the time of the Greek emperors or of the caliphs; since, if the capital and pedestal are of sufficiently good workmanship to belong to the former of these periods, they are not so perfect but that art may have reached so far in the latter.”\n",
      "On the south-west side of the city, at a mile’s distance, are situated the catacombs, the ancient burial-place of Alexandria; a remarkable object, although they cannot be compared to those of the ancient Thebes. The Baron de Tott, in describing these, observes “that Nature not having furnished this part of Egypt with a ridge of rocks, like that which runs parallel with the Nile above Delta, the ancient inhabitants of Alexandria could only have an imitation by digging into a bed of solid rock; and thus they formed a Necropolis, or City of the Dead. The excavation is from 30 to 40 feet wide, 200 long, and 25 deep, and is terminated by gentle declivities at each end. The two sides, cut perpendicularly, contain several openings, about 10 or 12 feet in width and height, hollowed horizontally; and which form, by their different branches, subterranean streets. One of these, which curiosity has disencumbered from the ruins and sands that render the entrance of others difficult or impossible, contains no mummies, but only the places they occupied. The order in which they were ranged is still to be seen. Niches, 20 inches square, sunk six feet horizontally, narrowed at the bottom, and separated from each other by partitions in the rock seven or eight inches thick, divided into checkers the two walls of this subterranean vault It is natural to suppose, from this disposition, that each mummy was introduced with the feet foremost into the cell intended for its reception; and that new streets were opened, in proportion as these dead inhabitants of Necropolis increased.” This observation, he adds, which throws a light on the catacombs of Memphis, \n",

      "chiefly celebrated as the author who raised the Italian tragic drama from its previous state of degradation, was born on the 17th January 1749, at the town of Asti, in Piedmont. He lost his father in early infancy; but he continued to reside with his mother, who married a second time, till his tenth year, when he was placed at the academy of Turin. After he had passed a twelvemonth at the academy, he went on a short visit to a relation who dwelt at Coni; and during his stay there he made his first poetical attempt, in a sonnet chiefly borrowed from lines in Ariosto and Metastasio, the only poets he had at that time read. When thirteen years of age, he was induced to commence the study of civil and canonical law; but the attempt only served to disgust him with every species of application, and to increase his relish for the perusal of French romances.\n",
      "By the death of his uncle, who had hitherto taken some charge of his education and conduct, he was left, at the age of fourteen, to enjoy without control his vast paternal inheritance, augmented by the recent accession of his uncle’s fortune. He now began to attend the ridingschool, where he acquired that rage for horses and equestrian exercise which continued to be one of his strongest passions till the close of his existence.\n",
      "After some time spent in alternate fits of extravagant dissipation and ill-directed study, he was seized with a deśire of travelling; and having obtained permission from the king, he departed, in 1766, under the care of an English preceptor. Restless and unquiet, he posted with the utmost rapidity through the towns of Italy; and his improvement was such as was to be expected from his mode of travelling and his previous habits. Dissatisfied with himself, he felt as little relish for spectacles or entertainments as for literature; and was as little amused by the gaiety of a carnival at Naples, as he was impressed by the remains of antiquity at Rome,· or the exhibitions of modern art at Florence and Bologna. This indifference and insensibility did not, however, arise from defect of talent or the ∙natural powers of taste, but from the want of some serious passion, or some ennobling or praiseworthy pursuit. Hoping to find in foreign countries some relief from the 'tedium and ennui with which he was oppressed, and being anxious to become acquainted with the French theatre, he proceeded to Paris; but his feelings were only those of disgust or indifference for the dramas which he saw represented in that capital. He seems, indeed, to have been completely dissatisfied with every thing he witnessed in France, and contracted a dislike to its people, which his intercourse in future years rather contributed to augment than diminish. In Holland he became deeply enamoured of a married lady, who returned his attachment, but who was soon obliged to accompany her husband to Switzerland. Alfieri, whose feelings were of the most impetuous description, was in despair at this separation, and returned to his own country in the utmost anguish and despondency of mind. While under this depression of spirits, he was induced to seek alleviation from works of literature; and the perusal of Plutarch’s Lives, which he read with profound emotion, inspired him with an enthusiastic passion for freedom and independence. Under the influence of this rage for liberty he recommenced his travels; and his only gratification, in the absence of freedom among the Continental States, appears to have been derived from contemplating the wild and sterile regions of the north of Sweden, where gloomy forests, lakes, and precipices conspired to excite those sublime and melancholy ideas which were congenial to his disposition. Human manners and human institutions he seems invariably to have surveyed with an eye of passion or prejudice, instead of viewing them with the calmness of a philosopher, who meditates how they may be rectified, or what lessons may be drawn from them. In every country his soul felt as if confined by the bonds of society: he everywhere panted for something more free in governments, more elevated in sentiment, more devoted in love, and more perfect in friendship. In search of this ideal world, he posted through various countries, more with the rapidity of a courier than of one who travels for amusement or instruction. During a journey to London, he engaged in an intrigue with a married lady of high rank; and having been detected, the publicity of a rencounter with the injured husband, and of a divorce, which followed, united to the knowledge he now acquired of the infamous character of the woman, to whom he was ardently attached, rendered it expedient and desirable for him to quit England. He then visited Spain and Portugal, where he became acquainted witlι the Abbé Caluso, who remained through life the most attached and estimable friend he ever possessed. In 1772 Alfieri returned to Turin, where he again became enamoured of a lady, whom he loved with his usual ardour, and who seems to have been as undeserving of a sincere attachment as those he had hitherto adored. In the course of a long attendance on his mistress, during a malady with which she was afflicted, he one day wrote a dialogue, or scene of a drama, which he left at -this lady’s house. About a year after, on a difference taking place between them, this piece was returned to him. Having then retouched and extended it t 0 five acts, it was performed at Turin in 1775, under the title of Cleopatra, whose amours had always been a favourite subject with Italian dramatists.\n",
      "From this moment Alfieri was seized with an immeasurable thirst of theatrical fame, and the remainder of his life was devoted to its attainment. His first two tragedies, Filippo and Polinice, were originally written in French prose; and when he came to versify them in Italian, he found that, from his Lombard origin, and long intercourse with foreigners, he expressed himself with feebleness and inaccuracy. Accordingly, with the view of improving his Italian style, he went to Tuscany, and, during an alternate residence at Florence and Sienna, he completed his Filip, po and Poliηice, and conceived the plan of various other dramas. While thus employed, he became acquainted with the countess of Albany, who then resided with her husband at Florence. For her he formed an attachment which, if less violent than his former loves, appears to have been more permanent. With this motive to remain at Florence, he could not endure the chains by which his vast possessions bound him to Piedmont. He therefore resigned his whole property to his sister, the countess Cumiana, reserving an annuity, which scarcely amounted to a half of his original revenues. At this period the countess of Albany, urged by the ill treatment she received from her husband, sought refuge in Rome, where she at length received permission from the pope to live apart from her tormentor. Alfieri followed the countess to that capital, where he completed fourteen tragedies, four of which were now for the first time printed at Sienna.\n",
      "At length, however, it was thought proper, that, by leaving Rome, he should remove the aspersions which had been thrown on the object of his affections. During the year 1783, he therefore travelled through different states of Italy, and published six additional tragedies. The interests of his love and literary glory had not diminished his rage for horses, which seems to have been at least the third passion of his soul. He came to England solely for the purpose of purchasing a number of these animals, which he brought with him to Italy. On his return he learned that the countess of Albany had gone to Colmar in Alsace, where he joined her, and resided with her under the same roof during the rest of his life. They chiefly passed their time between Alsace and Paris, but at length took up their abode entirely in that metropolis. While here, Alfieri made arrangements with Didot for an edition of his tragedies; but was soon after forced to quit Paris by the storms of the Revolution. He recrossed the Alps with the countess, and finally settled at Florence. The last ten years of his life, which he spent in that city, seem to have been the happiest of his existence. During that long period his tranquillity was only interrupted by the entrance of the revolutionary armies into Florence m 1799. Though an enemy of kings, the aristocratic feelings of Alfieri rendered him also a decided foe to the principles and leaders of the French Revolution; and he rejected, with the utmost contempt, those advances which were made with a view to bring him over to their cause.. The concluding years of his life were laudably employed in the study of Greek literature, and in perfecting a series of comedies.

      "The character of Alfieri may be best appreciated from the portrait which he has drawn of himself in his own Memoirs of his Life. He was evidently of an irritable, impetuous, and almost ungovernable temper. Pride, which .seems to have been a ruling sentiment, may account for many apparent inconsistencies of his character. While it made him abhor kings, because superior to himself, it led him to detest those republicans who, by too near an approach, contaminated aristocratic dignity; and it induced him, while yet undistinguished himself, and panting for literary fame, to decline a proffered introduction to Metastasio and Rousseau. But as all his bad qualities were greatly softened by the cultivation of literature, it may be presumed, that a better education, and an earlier employment of his \n",

      "the Great, king of England, was the fifth and youngest son of AEthelwolf, king of the West Saxons, and was born at Wantage, in Berkshire, in 849. He distinguished himself, during the reign of his brother Ethelred, in several engagements against the Danes, and upon his death succeeded to the crown, in the year 871, and the 22d of his age. At his ascending the throne he found himself involved in a dangerous war with the Danes, and placed in such circumstances of distress as called for the greatest valour, resolution, and all the other virtues with which he was adorned. The Danes had already penetrated into the heart of his kingdom; and before he had been a month upon the throne, he was obliged to take the field against those formidable enemies. After many battles gained on both sides, he was at length reduced to the greatest distress, and was entirely abandoned by his subjects. In this situation Alfred, conceiving himself no longer a king, laid aside all marks of royalty, and took shelter in the house of one who kept his cattle. He retired afterwards to the isle of AEthelingey, in Somersetshire, where he built a fort for the security of himself, his family, and the few faithful servants who repaired thither to him. When he had been about a year in this retreat, having been informed that some of his subjects had routed a great army of the Danes, killed their chief, and taken their magical standard,^[1. “This,” says Sir John Spelman, “was a banner, with the image of a raven magically wrought by the three sisters of Hi∏guar and Hubba, on purpose for their expedition, in revenge of their father Lodebroch’s murder; made, they say, almost in an instant, being by them at once begun and finished in a noontide, and believed by the Danes to have carried great fatality with it, for which it was highly esteemed by them. It is pretended, that being carried in a battle, towards good success it would always seem to clap its wings, and make as if it would fly; but towards the approach of mishap, it would hang down and not move.” {LΛfe of Alfred, p∙ 61∙) ] he issued his letters, giving notice where he was, and inviting his nobility to come and consult with him. Before they came to a final determination, Alfred, putting on the habit of a harper, went into the enemy’s camp, where, without suspicion, he was everywhere admitted, and had the honour to play before their princes. Having thereby acquired an exact knowledge of their situation, he returned in great secrecy to his nobility, whom he ordered to their respective homes, there to draw together each man as great a force as he could; and upon a day appointed there was to be a general rendezvous at the great wood called Selwood, in Wiltshire. This affair was transacted so secretly and expeditiously, that, in a little time, the king, at the head of an army, approached the Danes, before they had the least intelligence of his design. Alfred, taking advantage of the surprise and terror they were in, fell upon them, and totally defeated them at AEthendune, now Eddington. Those who escaped fled to a neighbouring castle, where they were soon besieged, and obliged to surrender at discretion. Alfred granted them better terms than they could expect. He agreed to give up the whole kingdom of the East Angles to such as would embrace the Christian religion, on condition that they would oblige the rest of their countrymen to quit the island, and, as much as was in their power, prevent the landing of any more foreigners. For the performance thereof he took hostages; and when in pursuance of the treaty, Guthrum the Danish captain came, with thirty of his chief officers, to be baptized, Alfred answered for him at the font, and gave him the name of AEthelstane ; and certain laws were drawn up betwixt the king and Guthrum for the regulation and government of the Danes settled in England. In 884 a fresh number of Danes landed in Kent and laid siege to Rochester· but the king coming to the relief of that city, they were obliged to abandon their design. Alfred had now great success, which was chiefly owing to his fleet, an advantage of his own creating. Having secured the sea-coastś, he fortified the rest of the kingdom with castles and walled towns; and he besieged and recovered from the Danes thfe city of London, which he resolved to repair, and to keep as a frontier.^[2. The Danes had possessed themselves of London in the time of his father, and had held it till now as a convenient place for them to land at, and fortify themselves in; neither was it taken from them but by a close siege. However, when it came into the kings hands, it was in a miserable condition, scarcely habitable, and all its fortifications ruined. The king, moved by the importance of the place, and the desire of strengthening his frontier against the Danes, restored it to its ancient splendour. And observing, that through the confusion of the times, many, both Saxons and Danes, lived in a loose, disorderly manner, without owning any government, he offered them now a comfortable establishment, if they would submit and become his subjects. This proposition was better received than he expected; for multitudes, growing weary of a vagabond kind of life, joyfully accepted such an offer. (CΛzw. Sax. p. 88.) ]\n",
      "After some years’ respite, Alfred was again called into the field; for a body of Danes, being worsted in the west of France, came with a fleet of 250 sail on the coast of Kent, and having landed, fixed themselves at Appletree. Shortly after, another fleet of eighty vessels coming up the Thames, the men landed, and built a fort at Middleton. Before Alfred marched against the enemy, he obliged the Danes settled in Northumberland and Essex to give him hostages for their good behaviour. He then moved towards the invaders, and pitched his camp between their armies, to prevent their junction. A great body, however, moved off to Essex, and, crossing the river, came to Farnham in Surrey, where they were defeated by the king’s forces. Meanwhile the Danes settled in Northumberland, in breach of treaty, and notwithstanding the hostages given, equipped two fleets, and, after plundering the northern and southern coasts, sailed to Exeter and besieged it. The king, as soon as he received intelligence, marched against them; but before he reached Exeter they had got possession of it. He kept them, however, blocked up on all sides, and reduced them at last to such extremities, that they were obliged to eat their horses, and were even ready to devour each ether. Being at length rendered desperate, they made a general sally on the besiegers; but were defeated, though with great loss on the king’s side. The remainder of this body of Danes fled into Essex, to the fort they had built there, and to their ships. Before Alfred had time to recruit himself, another Danish leader, whose name was Laf, came with a great army out of Northumberland, and destroyed all before him, marching on to the city of Werheal in the west, whieh is supposed to be Chester, where they remained the rest of that year. The year following they invaded North Wales; and after having plundered and destroyed every thing, they divided, one body returning to Northumberland, another into the territories of the East Angles, from whence they proceeded to Essex, and took possession of a small island called AIeresig. Here they did not long remain; for having separated, some sailed up the 'river Thames, and others up the Lea road, where, drawing up their ships, they built a fort not far from London, which proved a great check upon the citizens, who went in a body and attacked it, but were repulsed with great loss. At harvest-time the king himself was obliged to encamp with a body of troops in the neighbourhood of the city, in order to cover the reapers from the excursions of the Danes. As he was one day riding by the side of the river Lea, after some observations he began to think that the Danish ships might be laid quite dry: this he attempted, and having succeeded, the Danes were forced to desert their fort and ships, and march away to the banks of the Severn where they built a fort, and wintered at a place called Quatbrig. ^[3. The king’s contrivance is thought to have produced the meadow between Hertford and Bow; for at Hertford was the Danish tort, and from thence they made frequent excursions on the inhabitants of London. Authors are not agreed as to the method the mg pursued in laying dry the Danish ships. Dugđale supposes that he did it by straightening the channels; but Henry oí Hun ι g∙ on alleges that he cut several canals, which exhausted its water. ] Such of the Danish ships as could be got off, the Londoners carried into their own road; the rest they burned and destroyed.\n",
      "Alfred enjoyed a profound peace during the last three years of his reign, which he chiefly employed in establishing and regulating his government, for the security of himself and his successors, as well as the ease and benefit of his subjects in general. After a troublesome reign of 28 years, he died on the 28th of October A. d. 900, and was buried at Winchester, in Hyde-abbey, under a monument of porphyry.\n",
      "All our historians agree in distinguishing him as one of the most valiant, wisest, and best of kings that ever reigned inEngland; and it is also generallyallowed, that he not only digested several particular laws still in being, but that he laid the first foundation of our present happy constitution. There is great reason to believe that we are indebted to this prince for trials by juries; and the Doomsday Book, which is preserved in the Exchequer, is thought to be no more than another edition of Alfred’s book of Winchester, which contained a survey of the kingdom. It is said also that he was the first who divided the kingdom into shires. What is ascribed to him is not a bare division of the country, but the settling of a new form of judicature; for after having divided his dominions into shires, he subdivided \n",

      "the ancient fortress and residence of the Moorish monarchs of Granada. It derives its name from the red colour of the materials with which it was originally built, Alhambra signifying a red house. It appears to a traveller a huge heap of as ugly buildings as can well be seen, all huddled together, seemingly without the least intention of forming one habitation out of them. The walls are entirely unornamented, all gravel and pebbles, daubed over with plaster by a very coarse hand; yet this is the palace of the Moorish-kings of Granada, indisputably the most curious place within that exists in Spain, perhaps in the world. In many countries may be seen excellent modern as well as ancient architecture, both entire and in ruins; but nothing to be met with anywhere else can convey an idea of this edifice, except the decorations of an opera, or the tales of the genii.\n",
      "Passing round the corner of the emperor’s palace, one is admitted at a plain, unornamented door in a corner. On my first visit, says Mr Swinburne (Travels in Spain), I confess I wąs struck with amazement, as I stept over the threshold, to find myself on a sudden transported into a species of fairy land. The first place you come to is the court called the commwna or del mesucar, that is, the common baths ; an oblong square, with a deep basin of clear water in the middle; two flights of marble steps leading down to the bottom; on each side a parterre of flowers, and a row of orange trees. Round the court runs a peristyle paved with marble; the arches bear upon very slight pillars, in proportions and style different from all the regular orders of architecture. The ceilings and walls are in-crustated with fretwork in stucco, so minute and intricate that the most patient draughtsman would find it difficult to follow it, unless he made himself master of the general plan. This would facilitate the operation exceedingly; for all this work is frequently and regularly repeated at certain distances, and has been executed by means of square moulds applied successively, and the parts joined together with the utmost nicety. In every division are Arabic sentences of different lengths, most of them expressive of the following meanings: “There is no conqueror but God;” or, “Obedience and honour to our lord Abouab-doulah.” The ceilings are gilt or painted, and time has caused no diminution in the freshness of their colours, though constantly exposed to the air. The lower part of the walls is Mosaic, disposed in fantastic knots and festoons. A work so novel, so exquisitely finished, and so different from all that he has ever seen, must afford a stranger the most agreeable sensations while he treads this magic ground. The porches at the ends are more like grotto-work than any thing else to which they can be compared. That on the right hand opens into an octagon vault, under the emperor’s palace, and forms a perfect whispering gallery, meant to be a communication between the offices of both houses.\n",
      "Opposite to the door of the communa through which you enter, is another leading into the quarto de lοs leones, or apartment of the lions, which is an oblong court, 100 feet in length and 50 in breadth, environed with a colonnade seven feet broad on the sides and 10 at the end. Two porticoes or cabinets, about 15 feet square, project into the court at the two extremities. The square is paved with coloured tiles, the colonnade with white marble. The walls are covered five feet up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, disposed chequerwise. Above and below is a border of small escutcheons, enamelled blue and gold, with an Arabic motto on a bend, signifying, “No conqueror but God.” The columns that support the roof and gallery are of white marble, very slender, and fantastically adorned. They are nine feet high, including base and capital, and eight inches and a half in diameter. They are very irregularly placed; sometimes singly, at others in groups of three, but more frequently two together. The width of the horse-shoe arches above them is four feet two inches for the large ones, and three for the smaller. The ceiling of the portico is finished in a much finer and more complicated manner than that of the communa, and the stucco laid on the walls with inimitable delicacy; in the ceiling it is so artfully frosted and handled as to exceed belief. The capitals are of various designs, though each design is repeated several times in the circumference of the court, but not the least attention has been paid to placing them regularly or opposite to each other. Not the smallest representation of animal life can be discovered amidst the varieties of foliages, grotesques, and strange ornaments. About each arch is a large square of arabesques, surrounded with a rim of characters, tha are generally quotations from the Koran. Over the pillars is another square of delightful filligree work, up is a wooden rim, or kind of corniçe, as much ennche with carving as the stucco that covers the part underneath. Over this projects a roof of red tiles, the only thing that disfigures this beautiful square. This ugly covering is a modern addition made by a late prime minister, who a few years ago gave the Alhambra a thorough repair. In Moorish times the building was covered with large painted and glazed tiles, of which a few are still to be seen In the centre of the court are twelve ill-made lions muzzled, their fore parts smooth, their hind parts rough, which bear upon their backs an enormous basin, out of which a lesser rises. While the pipes were kept in good order, a great volume of water was thrown up, that, falling down into the basins, passed through the beasts, and issued out of their mouths into a large reservoir, where it communicated by channels with the jets ďeau in the apartments. This fountain is of white marble, embellished with many festoons and Arabic distiches.\n",
      "Passing along the colonnade, and keeping on the south side, you come to a circular room occupied by the men as a place for drinking coffee, &c. A fountain in the middle refreshed the apartment in summer. The form of this hall, the elegance of its cupola, the cheerful distribution of light from above, and the exquisite manner in which the stucco is designed, painted, and finished, exceed all power of description. Every thing in it inspires the most pleasing, voluptuous ideas; yet in this sweet retreat they pretend that Abouabdoulah assembled the Abencerrages, and caused their heads to be struck off into the fountain. Continuing your walk round, you are next brought to a couple of rooms at the head of the court, which are supposed to have been tribunals, or audience-chambers.\n",
      "Opposite to the sala de los Abencerrages is the entrance into the torre de las dos hermanas, or the tower of the two sisters; so named from two very beautiful pieces of marble, laid as flags in the pavement. This gate exceeds all the rest in profusion of ornaments, and in beauty of prospect which it affords through a range of apartments, where a multitude of arches terminate in a large window open to the country. In a gleam of sunshine, the variety of tints and lights thrown upon this enfilade are uncommonly rich. The first hall is the concert room, where the women sat; the musicians played above in four balconies. In the middle is ay⅛ ďeau. The marble pavement is equal to the finest existing, for the size of the flags and evenness of the colour. The two sisters, which give name to the room, are slabs that measure 15 feet by seven and a half, without flaw or stain. The walls, up to a certain height, are mosaic, and above are divided into very neat compartments of stucco, all of one design, which is also followed in many of the adjacent halls and galleries. The ceiling is a fretted cove. To preserve this vaulted roof, as well as some of the other principal cupolas, the outward walls of the towers are raised ten feet above the top of the dome, and support another roof over all, by which means no danger can ever be caused by wet weather or excessive heat and cold. From this hall you pass round the little myrtle garden of Lindaraxa, into an additional building made to the east end by Charles V. The rooms are small and low. His dear motto, Plus outre, appears on every beam. This leads to a little tower projecting from the line of the north wall, called el tocador, or the dressing-room of the sultana, ļt is a small square cabinet, in the middle of an open gallery, from which it receives light by a door and three windows. The look-out is charming. In one corner is a large marble flag, drilled full of holes, through which the smoke of perfumes ascended from furnaces below; and here, it is presumed, the Moorish queen was wont to sit to fumigate and sweeten her person. The emperor caused this pretty room to be painted with representations of his wars, and a great variety of grotesques, which appear to be copies, or at least imitations, of those in the loggie of the Vatican. From hence you go through a long passage to the hall of ambassadors, which is magnificently decorated with innumerable varieties of mosaics, and the mottoes of all the kings of Granada. This long narrow anti-chamber opens into the communa on the left hand, and on the right into the great audience-hall in the tower of Comares; a noble apartment, 36 feet square, 36 high up to the cornice, and 18 from thence to the centre of the cupola. The walls on three sides are 15 feet thick, on the other nine; the lower range of windows 13 feet high. The whole wall is inlaid with mosaic of many colours, disposed in intricate knots, stars, and other figures. In every part various Arabic sentences are repeated.\n",
      "Having thus completed the tour of the upper apartments, which are upon a level with the offices of the new palace, you descend to the lower floor, which consisted of bed-chambers and summer-rooms: the back stairs and passages, that facilitated the intercourse between them, are without number. The most remarka\n",

      "as the name implies, is a slaty rock, though sometimes it occurs in balls. The colour is bluish-black, with a strong shade of grey; fracture straight slaty; fragments tabular; its internal lustre is glimmering; it retains its colour in the streak, but acquires more lustre; soft; not particularly brittle; when exposed to the air it effloresces, and acquires an aluminous taste.\n",
      "This mineral has never been accurately analyzed; but there can be no doubt , that it contains silica, alumina, iron, sulphur, charcoal, and often likewise potash. Probably this was the mineral upon which the alumen scissile of the ancients was found.\n",
      "Bituminous shale, the Brandschiefer of the Germans, is a slaty mineral, which almost constantly accompanies beds of coal, and accordingly is very common in Great Britain. Its colour is brownish-black; its fracture is thin slaty; fragments tabular; internal lustre glimmering, but the colour is not altered; very soft; rather sectile; feels rather greasy; easily frangible. When heated it burns with a pale flame and sulphureous odour, and becomes white. It has never been accurately analyzed; but it is probably nothing more than slate-clay, which occurs so abundantly in the independent coal formation ' impregnated with the matter of coal. Its other principal constituents must be silica, alumina, and iron pyrites.\n",
      "Slate-clay itself, at least not sufficiently impregnated with coaly matter to deserve the name of bituminous shale, is frequently employed in the making of alum. This is the case in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.\n",
      ". Several native varieties of sulphate of alumina and soda alum occur in South America, some of the most remarkable of which it may be proper to specify.\n",
      "1. Sulphate .of alumina from Rio Saldana. It is said to occur in nests in the transition-slate of the Andes. The colour is white, here and there tinged yellow, obviously from external impurities. It occurs in fine crystalline needles; lustre silky; taste that of alum, but stronger; specific gravity 1.6606; soft; before the blowpipe behaves like alum. The writer of this article subjected it to a chemical analysis, and found its constituents as follows :—\n",
      "[table]\n",
      "This is equivalent to\n",
      "1 atom sulphate of alumina,\n",
      "6 atoms water, ∙τ⅞θ atom sulphate of soda, ∙ s 1 θ atom persulphate of iron.\n",
      "So that if the sulphate of soda and persulphate of iron be only accidental ingredients, the mineral is a compound of\n",
      "[table]\n",
      "2. Polcura, or alum-earth, found near the summit of a lofty ridge near El Paso de las Damas, in the Chilian Andes, and used as a mordant by the inhabitants in dyeing red. This mineral was brought over to Great Britain by Dr Gillies, who was kind enough to favour the writer of this article with a specimen. It occurs in hard masses, partly earthy, partly fibrous. The fibres have a silky lustre. The colour is white, and the taste that of alum.\n",
      "When digested in water, a portion was dissolved, and a portion remained in the form of a white insipid earth. The quantity of insoluble matter differed very much in different parts of the specimen. The least was 8∙62, and the greatest 34∙65 per cent. This insoluble matter contained a little sulphur; for, when heated, it emitted a blue flame with the smell of sulphureous acid. The rest of it was a mixture of alumina and silica, tinged yellow by peroxide of iron. The portion dissolved in water, being subjected to analysis, was found to consist of\n",
      "[table]\n",
      "3. Soda-alum. It occurs native in the province of St .Tuan, situated to the north of Mendoza, on the east side of the Chilian Andes, at about lat. 30° S. The alum is white, and composed of fibres adhering longitudinally.\n",
      "\n",
      "and having a certain breadth, but very thin. It bears some resemblance to fibrous gypsum, but is harder, not being scratched by the nail, though the knife scratches it with great ease. It is sectile. The outer fibres are white and only slightly translucent, as if they had lost a portion of their water; but the internal fibres are transparent, and have a silky aspect.\n",
      "It tastes precisely like alum, and is very soluble, water at the temperature of 62° dissolving 3∙773 parts of it, and boiling water dissolving any quantity whatever. When exposed to heat, it behaves very nearly as common alum.\n",
      "Its constituents were found to be—\n",
      "[table]\n",
      "It will be observed that the sulphuric acid constitutes just four atoms, the soda one atom, and the alumina just 0∙29 less than three atoms. But the quantity of lime and oxides of iron present is exactly equivalent to 0*29 atom of alumina. Hence these substances appear to have displaced a small∙quantity of alumina in the salt. The water amounts to very nearly twenty atoms. It is obvious from all this, that the true constitution of the salt is—\n",
      "[table]\n",
      "It contains five atoms less water than soda-alum artificially crystallized.\n",
      "4. There is a mineral called aluminite, which was observed in the environs of Halle many years ago, and which was afterwards detected by Mr Webster in the chalk rocks of Ncwhaven in Sussex, which, if it were sufficiently abundant, would constitute an excellent material for the manufacture of alum.\n",
      "Its colour is snow-white. It occurs in reniform pieces of greater or smaller size; fracture fine earthy; dull; streak glistening; opaque; adheres feebly to the tongue; soils very slightly; very soft; feels fine, but meagre; specific gravity 1∙7054. Its constituents, as determined by three several analyses of Stromeycr, are—\n",
      "[table]\n",
      "It is therefore a hydrous trisulphate of alumina.\n",
      "Four different processes are employed in the manufacture of alum, according to the nature of the mineral from which the alum is to be extracted.\n",
      "The process employed at Tolfa is the simplest of all. If the Tolfa stone be kept constantly moistened with water for about two months, it falls to powder of itself, and yields alum by lixiviation. But this is not the process employed by the manufacturers. The alum-stone is broken into small pieces, and piled on the top of a perforated dome, in which a wood fire is kindled. The smoke and flame of the wood penetrate through the pieces of alum-stone, and a sulphureous odour is disengaged, owing to the decomposition of a portion of the sulphuric acid in the stone. This roasting is twice performed; the pieces of ore which, the first time, were at the edge of the dome, being the second time put in the middle. The process of roasting this stone requires considerable attention. If the heat be too great, the quality of yielding alum is destroyed: if the heat be too small, the stone does not readily fall to powder. There can be little doubt that the unroasted stone would yield more alum than the roasted; but probably the additional labour requisite in the latter case would more than swallow up the increase of product.\n",
      "The roasted stone, which has now acquired a reddish colour, is placed in rows between trenches filled with water. This liquid is so frequently sprinkled on it, that the stone is always moist. In two or three days it falls to powder, like slacked quicklime; but the daily watering is continued for a month. The success of this part of the operation is said to depend very much on the weather. When the weather is rainy, the alum is all washed out, and little or nothing left for the manufacturer to extract. In such cases, it is obvious that the alum-stone should be protected from the rain by a shed.\n",
      "When the stone has by this process been reduced to a sufficiently fine powder, it is thrown into a leaden boiler filled two thirds with water. During the boiling, the powder is frequently stirred up, and the water that evaporates is replaced. When the boiling has been continued for a sufficient time, the fire is withdrawn, and time allowed for the earthy matter to subside to the bottom. A cock is then opened, which allows the clear liquor to flow out into deep wooden square vessels, so made that they can be easily taken to pieces. Here the alum gradually crystallizes, and attaches itself to the sides and bottom of the vessel. The mother liquid is now drawn off into shallower wooden troughs, where more alum crystals are deposited. The liquid has now a red colour, and is muddy; and the last alum crystals are mixed with this red matter. They are washed clean in the mother liquor, which is finally pumped into a trough, and used in subsequent processes.\n",
      "The alum obtained at Tolfa is known by the name of Roman alum, and is in very high estimation. It is always mixed with a little reddish powdery matter, which is easily separated from it. What this red matter is, has not been ascertained; but it is not peroxide of iron. To the eye it has very much the appearance of a vegetable matter. We have some notion that it is added artificially by the sellers of Roman alum. Probably Roman alum at first had a red tinge, in consequence of the red matter in the mother liquor remaining partially attached to it. The goodness of the alum may have given the purchasers a partiality to the red colour, and induced the sellers to add a red powder artificially. We have never had an opportunity ourselves of examining this matter, but have been informed by those who have, that it contains no iron.\n",
      "It is not improbable that this process would be improved by grinding the Tolfa stone to a fine powder in a mill, without any previous roasting, and then keeping the powder moistened with water for a considerable time. It the residual earth, after the alum is extracted, be boiled with sulphuric acid, the liquid yields alum crystals by evaporation. This is a demonstration that neither the alumina nor the potash is exhausted, and that the sulphuric acid driven off by the roasting is so much alum lost to the manufacturer. Indeed the quantity of sulphuric acid in the alum-stone is not sufficient to occupy the whole of the potash in the formation of alum. It would be necessary to add about one tenth of the weight of the alum-stone of sulphuric acid, if it were wanted to employ the whole potash present in the ston\n",
      "\n",
      "----\n",
      "being very different in its composition, requires a different treatment to fit it for yielding alum. If the alum-slate contain a notable quantity of lime or magnesia, it does not answer the purposes of the manufacturer so well. ' Indeed the proportion of lime present may be conceived to be such that no alum whatever would be obtained. As alum-slate has never been subjected to accurate analysis, we do not know in what proportion these two earths exist in it, or whether they may not, in many cases, be absent altogether. The essential ingredients in alum-slate, for the alum-makers, are alumina and iron pyrites.\n",
      "The first process is to roast the ore. In Sweden, where the fuel is wood, and consequently expensive, it is customary to use the alum-slate itself as fuel for roasting the ore. For this purpose a small layer of brushwood is covered with pieces of alum-slate, and set on fire; and, as the combustion proceeds, new layers of alum-slate are added. It is usual to place alternate layers of roasted and unroasted alum-slate. The combustion continues for a month or six weeks. At Whitby, coal is employed for roasting the alum-slate. Indeed the alum-slate of Whitby is lighter coloured than that of Sweden, and probably would not burn of itself. So great is the quantity of combustible matter in the Swedish alum-slate, that it is employed as fuel for burning limestone. Great quantities of limestone are burnt in this manner at Hunneberg, near the south side of the lake Wener. The roasted ore has usually a brown colour. When it is red, the quantity of alum which it yields is considerably diminished.\n",
      "By this roasting the pyrites is decomposed. The sulphur is converted into sulphuric acid, while the iron is oxidized. In what manner this change is produced it is not easy to say. Indeed it does not seem certain that pyrites is a constant ingredient in alum-slate. We have never been able to detect any, by the eye, in any specimens of Whitby alum-slate which we have examined. At Haensaeter, in Sweden, no sulphate of iron crystallizes when the liquid is evaporated; yet, if pyrites had been present, it is difficult to see any reason that should prevent this salt from being formed. Hence it is probable, that in alum-slate the sulphur is sometimes at least combined with other substances than iron. It must always be in a state of combination; for, if it were in a loose state, it would be driven off by the roasting. This point deserves to be elucidated by analyzing different varieties of alum-slate.\n",
      "The roasted ore has an astringent taste, owing to the sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina which it contains. The next process is to lixiviate it with water, in order to dissolve these salts. For this purpose it is put into reservoirs made of wood or masonry, with a stopcock at the bottom to draw off the water. The usual method is to keep the water for twelve hours in contact with ore that has been twice lixiviated; then to draw it off, and allow it to remain for an equal period on ore that has been once lixiviated. Lastly, it is run upon fresh ore, and allowed to remain on it for twelve hours longer. If the specific gravity of the liquid thus treated be 1∙25 at the temperature of 55°, it may be considered as saturated with sulphate of alumina and sulphate of iron. But we presume that this specific gravity is not often obtained.\n",
      "The liquid, thus impregnated with salt, is now boiled down in leaden vessels to the proper consistency for crystallization. In Sweden, the fuel employed for this purpose is alum-slate. By this means a double effect is produced; the liquid is evaporated, and the alum-slate is roasted. During the boiling, abundance of oxide of' iron falls mixed with selenite, if lime be one of the constituents of the alum-slate. When the liquid is sufficiently concentrated, it is let into a square reservoir, in order to crystallize. Great quantities of sulphate of iron crystals are usually deposited in this vessel. These are collected by drawing the liquid off into another reservoir. When all the sulphate of iron that can be obtained has been separated, a quantity of sulphate of potash, muriate of potash, or putrid urine, is mixed with the liquid. The sulphate of potash is procured from the sulphuric acidmakers, and the muriate of potash from the soap-makers. By this addition, alum is formed in the liquid, and it gradually deposits itself in crystals on the sides of the vessel. These crystals are collected, and dissolvedin the smallest quantity of boiling water that will take them up. This solution is poured into large wooden casks. In a fortnight or three weeks the alum crystallizes, and covers the side’s and bottom of the cask. The hoops are now taken off, and the staves of the cask removed. A mass of alum crystals, having the shape of the cask, remains. This mass is pierced, the mother liquor allowed to run out, and preserved for a subsequent process. The alum, being now broken in pieces, is fit for sale.\n",
      "The manufacture of alum from bituminous shale and slate-clay bears a considerable resemblance to the manufacture from alum-slate, but differs in several particulars. There are two works of this kind in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, managed with great skill, and excellent in every respect. We shall give a sketch of the processes followed in these works. The bituminous shale and slate-clay employed are obtained from old coal-pits, which are very extensive in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. The air in these coal-pits is moist, and its average temperature about 62°. The shale, having been exposed for many years, has gradually opened in the direction of its slaty fracture, so as to resemble in some respects a half-shut fan; and all the chinks in it are filled with a saline efflorescence in threads. This salt is white, with a shade of green; has a sweetish astringent taste; and consists of a mixture of sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina. In order to obtain these salts in a state of solution,’ nothing more is requisite than to lixiviate this shale with water. The lixiviated ore being left exposed to the weather, forms more salt, which is gradually washed out of it by the rain-water, and this water is collected and preserved for use.\n",
      "The next step in the process is to boil down the liquid to a sufficient state of concentration. At Campsie, all these boilers are composed of stone, and the heat is applied to the surface. This is a great saving, as leaden vessels are not only much more expensive, but require more frequent renewal. When the liquid is raised to a sufficiently high temperature in the stone reservoir, pounded sulphate of potash, or muriate of potash, as they can be procured, is mixed with it; and there is an agitator in the vessel, by which it is continually stirred about. This addition converts the sulphate of alumina into alum. The liquid is now let into another trough, and allowed to remain till it crystallizes. In this liquid there are two salts contained in solution, viz. sulphate of iron and alum; and it is an object of great consequence to separate them completely from each other. The principal secret consists in drawing off the mother liquor at the proper time; for the alum is much less soluble in water than the sulphate of iron, and therefore crystallizes first. The first crystals of alum formed are very impure. They have a yellow colour, and seem to be partly impregnated with  sulphate of iron. They are dissolved in hot water, and the solution poured into troughs, and allowed to crystallize a second time. These second crystals, though much purer, are not quite free from sulphate of iron; but the separation is accomplished by washing them repeatedly with cold water; for sulphate of iron is much more soluble in that liquid than alum. These second crystals are now dissolved in as small a quantity of hot water as possible, and the concentrated liquid poured while hot into large casks, the surface of which is covered with two cross beams. As the liquor cools, a vast number of alum crystals form on the sides and surface. The casks are allowed to remain till the liquid within is supposed to be nearly of the temperature of the atmosphere. This, in winter, requires eleven days; in summer, fourteen or more. We have seen the liquid in a cask that had stood eleven days in summer, still more than blood-hot. The hoops are then removed, precisely as in the manufacture of alum from alum-slate.\n",
      "There always remains in the boilers a yellowish substance, consisting chiefly of peroxide of iron. This is exposed to a strong heat in a reverberatory furnace, and it becomes red. In this state it is washed, and yields more alum. The red residue is ground to a fine powder, and dried. It then answers all the purposes of Venetian red as a pigment. By altering the temperature to which this matter is exposed, a yellow ochre is obtained instead of a red.\n",
      "In France, where alum-ores are by no means abundant, alum is manufactured from clay. This method of making the salt was first put in practice by Chaptal, when professor of chemistry at Montpellier. His methods have been since gradually improved, and brought to a state of considerable perfection. The first process tried was this: the clay was reduced to a fine powder in a mill, and then mixed with sulphuric acid. After remaining some days, it was exposed for twenty-four hours to a temperature of about 130°. It was then lixiviated, and the liquid mixed with urine or potash. This method being found inconvenient, was abandoned for the following: the clay being well ground, was mixed with half its weight of the saline residue from a mixture of sulphur and nitre. This residue is little else than sulphate of potash. The mixture was formed into balls about five inches in diameter, which were calcined in a potter’s furnace. They were then placed on the floor of a chamber in which sulphuric acid was made. The acid vapour caused them to swell, and to open on all sides. In about a month they were suffi\n",

      "Duhe of, was born in 1508, and descended from one of the most illustrious families in Spain. His grandfather, Frederick de Toledo, was his preceptor in the military and political arts; and he displayed his valour at the battle of Pavia and at the siege of Tunis. The ambitious Charles V. selected Alva as a proper instrument for conducting his military enterprises. In 1538 he made him his general; and, after several operations, in which he displayed both valour and military skill, in 1542 he successfully defended Perpignan against the dauphin of France.\n",
      "In 1546 Alva was made general in chief of the army which marched against the German Protestants, who were marshalled under the banners of the elector of Saxony. Francis, the king of France, died at Rambouillet, and by his death a considerable change was made in the state of Europe. Charles therefore instantly began his march from Egra on the borders of Bohemia, and entering the southern frontier of Saxony, attacked Altorf upon the Elster. Incessantly pushing forward^ he arrived on the evening of the 23d of April on the banks of the Elbe, opposite to Muhlberg. The river at that place was three hundred paces in breadth and about four feet in depth, its current rapid, and the bank possessed by the Saxons was higher than that which he occupied. In opposition to the opinion of the duke of Alva and his other officers, Charles, with undaunted courage, though with inexpressible difficulty, led his army through the river and engaged the Saxons. The elector displayed great personal courage and military knowledge; but having received a wound in the face, he at last surrendered himself prisoner. The emperor proceeded towards Wittenberg, whither the remains of the Saxon army had fled, carrying along with him the captive prince, as a spectacle of consternation and amazement to his own subjects. But when he approached the town, he found it defended by the vigorous efforts of the elector’s wife, along with the inhabitants. He summoned Sibylla once and a second time to open the gates, informing her, that if she persisted in her obstinacy, the elector should answer for it with his head. Accordingly he brought his prisoner to an immediate trial. The proceedings against him were as irregular as the stratagem was barbarous. Instead of consulting the states of the empire, or remitting the cause to any court, which, according to the German constitution, might have legally taken cognizance of the elector’s crime, he subjected the greatest prince in the empire to the jurisdiction of a court-martial. The emperor selected the unrelenting duke of Alva as a proper instrument to carry into effect any measure of violence and oppression, and therefore made him president of that court, composed of Spanish and Italian officers. Moved more by the entreaties of his wife than by a sense of his own danger, the elector, in order to save his life, submitted to all the rigorous and unjust measures that were proposed; but when it was added, that he should also renounce the Protestant faith and become a Roman Catholic, he refused to act in opposition to his conscience, and bravely fell a sacrifice to the cause of truth.\n",
      "In 1552 Alva was intrusted with the command of the army intended to invade France, and was constrained by the opinion and authority of the emperor to lay siege to Mentz, in opposition to his own military knowledge; but notwithstanding all his valour and abilities, the duke of Guise successfully defended the place. In consequence of the success of the French arms in Piedmont, he was made commander in chief of all the emperor’s forces in Italy, and at the same time invested with unlimited power. Success did not, however, attend his first attempts, and after several unfortunate attacks he was obliged to retire into winter quarters. The next year he was sent into the pope’s territories; and, had he not been restrained by his master, he would have taken possession of all his fortified places, and deterred Henry from entering into any new connection with him, and have thereby prevented the renewal of the war. Philip was strongly disposed to peace, but Alva was inclined to severe measures: he, however, yielded to the instructions of his master, until being deluded, and sometimes haughtily answered, he at length sent Pino de Loffredo with a letter to the college of cardinals, and another to Paul, in which, after enumerating the various injuries which his master had received, and renewing his former offers of peace and friendship, he concluded with protesting that, if his offers were again rejected, the pope should be chargeable with all the calamities that might follow. The pope threw Loffredo into prison; and, had not the college of cardinals interposed, he would even have put him to death; and on account of Philip’s failing to pay tribute for Naples, he deprived him of the sovereignty of that kingdom. This violent conduct of Paul gave great offence throughout all Europe, and greatly lessened his influence in Italy; but Philip, though a young, ambitious, and powerful monarch, and of a temper impatient of injuries and affronts, moved with a religious veneration, discovered an amazing reluctance to proceed to extremities. After much time spent in negotiation, Philip was at last forced to give orders for Alva to take the field. He cheerfully obeyed, and began his march in the beginning of September 1556, with a well-disciplined army; and after reducing several towns in the Campagna di Roma, he pursued his conquests to the very gates of Rome. The circumstances, however, in which Alva found his army, induced him to make a truce of forty days, and after several negotiations he yielded to peace. One of its terms was, that the duke of Alva should in person ask forgiveness of the haughty pontiff whom he had conquered. Proud as the duke was by nature, and accustomed to treat with persons of the highest dignity, yet such was the superstitious veneration then entertained for the papal character, that he confessed his voice failed him at the interview, and his presence of mind forsook him. Not long after this he was sent at the head of a splendid embassy to Paris, to espouse, in the name of his master, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry, kin∏∙ of France. ^ , c\n",
      "Philip II., his new master, being strongly devoted to the Roman see, and determined, by the most unrelenting severity and unbounded cruelty, to reclaim rebels to his government and dissenters from his faith, pitched upon Alva as the fittest person to carry this system into practice. With this design, therefore, he was sent into the Low Countries in 1567. Having received his orders, armed with such power as left only the shadow of authority to the natural governor, and provided with 10,000 veterans, he marched towards that devoted country. When he arrived, he soon showed how much he merited the confidence which his master reposed in him, and instantly erected a bloody tribunal to try all persons who had been engaged in the late commotions which the civil and the religious tyranny of Philip had excited. He imprisoned the counts Egmont and Horn, the two popular leaders of the Protestants, and soon brought them to an unjust trial, and condemned them to death. In a little time he totally annihilated every privilege of the people, and, with uncontrolled fury and cruelty, put multitudes of them to death. Beholding herself deprived of all authority, and her subjects devoted to destruction, the duchess of Parma resigned her office, disdaining to hold the nominal, while the actual reins of power were in the hands of Alva. This event increased the general tide of wretchedness, and every place was filled with scenes of horror and dismay. Unable for the present to administer the least aid, the prince of Orange saved his life by flight. This noble prince suddenly collecting an army in Germany, returned to the relief of his countrymen; and at the same time Prince Lewis, his brother, marched with an army into Friesland. Although success at first attended Lewis, yet the activity and experience of Alva prevailed, and he was totally defeated. The prince of Orange proved a more formidable foe; and it required the united talents of Alva and his son Frederick of Toledo to prevent the prince from making a descent upon the Netherlands. But notwithstanding all the address and military skill of the prince of Orange, the descent was prevented; and Alva had the glory of baffling that great leader, and of compelling him, after great loss of men, to disband the remainder of his army. Alva could now indulge his cruelty unrestrained. The executioner was instantly employed in removing all those friends of freedom whom the sword had spared. In most of the considerable towns Alva built citadels. In the city of Antwerp he erected a statue of himself, which was a monument no less of his vanity than of his tyranny: he was figured trampling on the necks of two smaller statues, representing the two estates of the Low Countries. By his unusual and arbitrary demand of new supplies from the states, he greatly aggravated this haughty insult. The exiles from the Low Countries, roused to action by his oppression, fitted out a kind of piratical fleet, and, after strengthening themselves by successful depredations, ventured upon the bold exploit of seizing the town of Bricl. Thus Alva, by his cruelty, became the unwitting instrument of the future independence of the seven Dutch provinces. The fleet of the exiles having met the Spanish fleet, totally defeated it, and reduced North Holland and Mons. Many cities hastened to throw off the yoke: while the states-general assembling at Dordrecht, openly declared against Alva’s government, and marshalled under the banners of the prince of Orange. This situation of affairs convinced Alva of the instability of a government upheld by terror and oppression; he therefore began, when too late, to employ more lenient measures. His preparations to oppose the gathering st\n",

      "Natural History, is a solid, opaque, ash-coloured, fatty, inflammable substance, variegated like marble, remarkably light, rugged, and uneven in its surface, and of a fragrant odour when heated. It does not effervesce with acids; it melts freely over the fire into a kind of yellow rosin; and is hardly soluble in spirit of wine.\n",
      "Ambergris is found swimming upon the sea, on the seacoast, or in the sand near the sea-coast; especially in the Atlantic Ocean, on the sea-coast of Brazil, and that of Madagascar; on the coasts of Africa, of the East Indies, China, Japan, and the Molucca Islands; but most of the ambergris which is brought to England comes from the Bahama Islands, from Providence, &c. where it is found on the coast. It is also sometimes found in the abdomen of whales by the whale-fishermen, always in lumps of various shapes and sizes, weighing from half an ounce to a hundred and more pounds. The piece which the Dutch East India Company bought from the king of Tydore weighed 182 pounds. An American fisherman from Antigua found, about fifty-two leagues south-east from the Windward Islands, a piece of ambergris in a whale, which weighed about 130 pounds, and sold for L.500 sterling.\n",
      "There have been many different opinions concerning the origin of this substance. It has been supposed to be a fossil bitumen or naphtha, exuding from the bowels of the earth in a fluid form, and distilling into the sea, where it hardens and floats on the surface. But having been frequently found in the bellies of whales, it has by others been considered as entirely an animal production. The most satisfactory account of the real origin of ambergris is that given by Dr Swediaur in the 73d volume of the Philosophical Transactions.\n",
      "We are told by all writers on ambergris, that sometimes claws and beaks of birds, feathers of birds, parts of vegetables, shells, fish, and bones of fish, are found in the middle of it, or variously mixed with it. Of a very considerable number of pieces, however, which Dr Swediaur examined, he found none that contained any such thing; though he allows that such substances may sometimes be found in it: but in all the pieces of any great size, whether found on the sea or in the whale, he constantly found a considerable quantity of black spots, which, after the most careful examination, appeared to be the beaks of the Sepia Octopodia ļ and these beaks, he thinks, might be the substances which have hitherto been always mistaken for claws or beaks of birds or shells. The presence of these beaks in ambergris proves evidently that all ambergris containing them is in its origin, or must once have been, of a very soft or liquid nature, as otherwise those beaks could not so constantly be intermixed with it throughout its whole substance.\n",
      "That ambergris is found either upon the sea and seacoast, or in the bowels of whales, is a fact universally credited. But it has never been satisfactorily determined, whether the ambergris found upon the sea and sea-coast is the same as that found in the whale, or whether they are different; whether that found on the sea or sea-coast has some properties, or constituent parts, which that found in the whale has not; and, lastly, whether that found in the whale is superior or inferior in its qualities and value to the former.\n",
      "It is likewise of consequence to know, whether ambergris is found in all kinds of whales, or only in a particular species of them; whether it is uniformly to be met with in those animals; and if so, in what part of their body it is to be found.\n",
      "All these questions we find very fully discussed by Dr Swediaur. According to the best information that he could obtain from several of the most intelligent persons employed in the spermaceti whale-fishery, and in procuring and selling ambergris, it appears that this substance is sometimes found in the belly of the whale, but in that particular species only which is called the spermaceti whale, and which, from its description and delineation, appears to be the Physeter AIacroceplιalus of Linnaeus.\n",
      "The New England fishermen, according to their account, have long known that ambergris is to be found in the spermaceti whale; and they are so convinced of this fact, that whenever they hear of a place where ambergris is found, they always conclude that the seas in that part are frequented by that species of whale.\n",
      "The persons who are employed in the spermaceti whale-fishery confine their views to the physeter macrocephalus. They look for ambergris in all the spermaceti whales they catch, but it seldom happens that they find any. Whenever they hook a spermaceti whale, they observe that it constantly not only vomits up whatever it has in its stomach, but also generally discharges its faeces at the same time; and if this latter circumstance takes place, they are commonly disappointed in finding ambergris in its belly. But whenever they discover a spermaceti whale, male or female, which seems torpid and sickly, they are always pretty sure to find ambergris, as the whale in this state seldom voids its faeces upon being hooked. They likewise generally meet with it in the dead spermaceti whales, which they sometimes find floating on the sea. It is observed also, that the whale in which they find ambergris often has a morbid protuberance, or, as they express it, a kind of gathering in the lower part of its belly, in which, if cut open, ambergris is found. It is remarkable that all those whales in whose bowels ambergris is found, seem not only torpid and sick, but arc also constantly leaner than others; so that, if we may judge from the constant union of these two circumstances, it would seem that a larger collection of ambergris in the belly of the whale is a source of disease, and probably sometimes the cause of its death. As soon as they hook a whale of this description, torpid, sickly, emaciated, or one that does not dung on being hooked, they immediately either cut up the above-mentioned protuberance, if there be any, or they rip open its bowels from the orifice of the anus, and find the ambergris sometimes in one, sometimes in different lumps, of generally from three to twelve and more inches in diameter, and from one pound to twenty or thirty pounds in weight, at the distance of two, but most frequently of about six or seven feet from the anus, and never higher up in the intestinal canal, which, according to their description, is in all probability the intestinum caecum, hitherto mistaken for a peculiar bag made by nature for the secretion and collection of this singular sub-, stance. That the part cut open to come at the ambergris is no other than the intestinal canal, is certain, because they constantly begin their incision at the anus, and find the cavity everywhere filled with the faeces of the whale, which, from their colour and smell, it is Impossible to mistake. The ambergris found in the intestinal canal is not so hard as that which is found on the sea or sea-coast, but soon grows hard in the air. When first taken out, it has nearly the same colour, and the same disagreeable smell, though not so strong, as the more liquid dung of the whale; but on exposing it to the air, it by degrees not only grows greyish, having its surface covered with a greyish dust, like old chocolate, but it also loses its disagreeable smell, and, when kept for a certain length of time, acquires the peculiar odour which is so agreeable to most people.\n",
      "The gentlemen the doctor conversed with confessed, that if they knew not from experience that ambergris thus found will in time acquire the above-mentioned qualities, they would by no means be able to distinguish ambergris from hard indurated faeces. This is so true, that whenever a whale voids its faeces upon being hooked, they look carefully to see if they can discover among the more liquid excrements (of which the whale discharges several barrels) some pieces floating on the sea, of a more compact substance than the rest. These they take up and wash, knowing them to be ambergris.\n",
      "In considering whether there be any material difference between the ambergris found upon the sea or sea-coast, and that found in the bowels or among the dung of the whale, the doctor refutes the opinion that all ambergris found in whales is of an inferior quality, and therefore much lower in price. Ambergris, he observes, is only valued for its purity, lightness, compactness, colour, and smell. There are pieces of ambergris found on different coasts, which are of a very inferior quality; whereas there are often found in whales pieces of it of the first value; nay, several pieces found in the same whale, according to the above-mentioned qualities, are more or less valuable. All ambergris found in whales has at first, when taken out of the intestines, very nearly the same smell and blackish colour as the liquid excrements pf that animal; sometimes it is quite hard, sometimes softish, but never so liquid as the natural faeces. By being accumulated after a certain length of time in the intestinal canal, it seems even there to become of a whiter colour, and less ponderous, and to acquire its agreeable smell. The only reason why ambergris found floating on the sea generally possesses this agreeable smell and hardness in a superior degree is, because it is commonly older, and has been longer exposed to the air. It is more frequently found in males than in females: the pieces found in females are generally smaller than those found in males, and inferior in quality. The disproportionately high price obtained for the larger pieces, therefore, proceeds from an intrinsic value in respect to quality, rather than a fictitious value on account of their rarity.\n",
      "It is known that the sepia octopodia, or cuttle-fish, is the constant and natural food of the spermaceti whale, or physeter macrocephalus. Of this the fishers are so well persuaded, that whenever they discover any recent relics of it swimming on the sea, they conclude that a whale o\n",

      "Amber has been of gi ’ eat repute in the world from the earliest times. Many years before Christ it was in esteem as a medicine; and Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus, AEschylus, and others, have commended its virtues. In the times of the Romans it was highly esteemed as a gem; and in the luxurious reign of Nero immense quantities of it were brought to Rome, and used for ornamenting works of various kinds.\n",
      "• The most remarkable property of this substance is, that when rubbed it draws or attraets other bodies to it; and this, it is observed, it does even to those substances to which the aneients thought it had an antipathy; as oily bodies, drops of water, human sweat, &c. Add, that by the friction it is brought to yield light pretty copiously in the dark; whence it is reckoned among the native phosphori.\n",
      "The property which amber possesses of attracting light bodies was very aneiently observed. Hence Thales of Miletus, 600 years before Christ, concluded that it was animated. But the first person who expressly mentions this substanee is Theophrastus, about the year 300 before Christ. The attractive property of amber is likewise occasionally taken notice of by Pliny, and other later naturalists, particularly by Gassendi, Sir Kenelm Digby, and Sir Thomas Browne; but it was generally apprehended that this quality was peculiar to amber and jet, and perhaps agate, till Gilbert published his treatise de Magnete, in the year 1600. From jjλtκrgon, the Greek name for amber, is derived the term electricity, which is now very extensively applied, not only to the power of attracting light bodies inherent in amber, but to other similar powers, and their various effeets, in whatever bodies they reside, or to whatever bodies they may be communicated.\n",
      "In amber there have been said to be letters found very well firmed; and even Hebrew and Arabic charaetcrs. Within some pieees, leaves, inseets, &e. have likewise been found ineluded; which seems to indicate either that the amber was originally in a fluid state, or that, having been exposed to the sun, it was softened and rendered susceptible of impressions from the leaves, inseets, &e. with which it eame in contact. The latter of these suppositions scems the more agreeable to the phenomenon, because insects, &c. are never found in the centre of pieees of amber, but always near the surface. It is observed by the inhabitants of plaees where amber is produced, that all animals, whcthcr terrestrial, aerial, or aquatic, are extremely fond of it, and that pieces of it are frequently found in their excrements. The bodies of inseets found buried in amber are generally viewed with admiration; but many of the most remarkable are to be suspeeted as counterfeit, the great priee at which beautiful specimens of this kind sell having tempted ingenious cheats to introduce animal bodies in such artful manners, into seemingly whole pieces of amber, that it is not easy to detect the fraud.\n",
      "Of those insects whieh have been originally inclosed in amber, some are plainly seen to have struggled hard for their liberty, and even to have left their limbs behind them in the attempt; it being no unusual thing to see, in a mass of amber that contains a stout beetle, the animal wanting one, or perhaps two of its legs, and those legs left in different places, nearer that part of the mass from which it has travelled. This also may aecount for the common aceident of finding legs or wings of flies, without the rest of their bodies, in pieees of amber; the inseets having, when entangled in the yet soft and viseid matter, escaped, at the expense of leaving those limbs behind them. Drops of clear water are sometimes also preserved m amber. These have doubtless been rcecived into it while soft, and preserved by its hardening round them. Beautiful leaves of a pinnated structure, resembling some of the ferns, or maidenhairs, have been found in some pieees; but these are rare,'and the specimens of great value. Mineral substances are also found at times lodged in masses of amber. Some of the pompous collections of the German princes boast of specimens of native gold and silver in masses of amber; but as there are many substances of the mareasite, and other kinds, that have all the glittering appearance of gold and silver, it is not to be too hastily concluded that these metals are really lodged in these beds of amber. Iron is found in various shapes immersed in amber; and as it is often seen eroded, and sometimes in the state of vitriol, it is not impossible that copper and the other metals may also be sometimes immersed in it in the same state: hence the bluish and greenish colours frequently found in the reeent pieees of amber may be owing, like the partieles of the gem colours, to those metals; but as the gems, by their dense texture, always retain their colours, this lighter and more lax bitumen usually loses what it gets of this kind by keeping some time. Small pebbles, grains of sand, and fragments of other stones, are also not untřequently found immersed in amber.\n",
      "Naturalists have been greatly divided as to the origin of this substanee, and what elass of bodies it belongs to; some referring it to the vegetable, others to the mineral, and some even to the animal kingdom. Pliny describes it as a resinous juice, oozing from aged pines and firs (others say from poplars, whole forests of whieh line the coasts of Sweden), and discharged thenee into the sea, where undergoing some alteration, it is thrown, in this form, upon the shores of Prussia, whieh lie very low. He adds, that it was hence the aneients gave it the denomination succinum, from succus, juice.\n",
      "Mr Brydone, in his Tour to Sicily and Malta, says that the river Giaretta, formerly eelebrated by the poets under the name of Simaethus, throws up near its mouth great quantities of amber. He mentions also a kind of artificial amber, not uncommon there, made, as he was told, from copal, but very different from the natural.\n",
      "According to Hartmann, amber is formed of a bitumen, mixed with vitriol and other salts. But though this were conceded in regard to the fossil amber, many dispute whether the sea amber be so produeed. It is however apparent, that all amber is of the same origin, and probably that whieh is found in the spa has been washed thither out of the eliffs; though Hartmann thinks it very possible that some of it maybe formed in the earth under the sea, and be washed up thenee. The sea amber is usually finer to the eye than the fossil; but the reason is, that it is divested of the coarse eoat with which the other is eovered while in the earth.\n",
      "Upon the whole, it seems generally agreed that amber is a true bitumen of a fossil origin. In the Journal de Physique, however, we find it asserted by Girtanner to be an animal product,—a sort of honey or wax formed by a species of large ant called by Linnaeus formica rufα. These ants, our author informs us, inhabit the old pine forests, where they sometimes form hills about six feet in diameter; and it is generally in these ancient forests, or in plaees where they have been, that fossil amber is found. This substanee is not so hard as that whieh is taken up on the shores of Prussia, and which is well known to naturalists. It has the eonsistenee of honey, or of half-melted wax, but is of a yellow eolour, like common amber: it gives the samđ produet by ehemical analysis, and it hardens like the other when it is suffered to remain some time in a solution of common salt. This aeeounts for the inseets that are so often found inclosed in it. Among these insects ants are always the most numerous; which tends further, Gĩrtanner thinks, to the confirmation of his hypothesis. Amber, then, in his opinion, is nothing but a vegetable oil rendered concrete by the acid of ants, just as wax is nothing but an oil hardened by the acid of bees; a fact incontestably proved, we are told, since M. Me-therie has been able to make artificial wax by mixing oil of olives with nitrous acid, and so perfect was the imitation that it could not be distinguished from the natural.\n",
      "Amber of the finest kind has been found in England. It is frequently thrown on the shores of Yorkshire, and many other places, and found even in our clay-pits. The pits dug for tile-clay, between Tyburn and Kensington gravel-pits, as well as that behind St George’s Hospital at Hyde-park corner, have afforded fine specimens.\n",
      "Poland, Silesia, and Bohemia are famous for the amber which they produce. Considerable quantities of it are also scattered along the shores of the German sea; and in Germany itself it is found on the banks of the rivers as well as in the bowels of the earth. Saxony, Sweden, and many other places in this tract of Europe, abound with it. But the countries lying on the Baltic afford fossil amber in the greatest abundance of all; and of these the most plentiful country is Prussia, and the next is Pomerania.\n",
      "Junker describes, after Neumann, the Prussian amber mines, which are the richest known. First, at the surface of the earth is found a stratum of sand. Immediately under this sand is a bed of clay, filled with small flints of about an inch diameter each. Under this clay lies a stratum of black earth or turf, filled with fossil wood, half-decomposed and bituminous: this stratum is extended upon a bank of minerals, containing little metal except iron, which are consequently pyrites. Lastly, under this bed the amber is found scattered about in pieces, or sometimes accumulated in heaps.\n",
      "Amber has a subacrid, resinous taste, and fragrant, aromatic smell, especially when dissolved. When boiled in water, it neither softens nor undergoes any sensible alteration. Exposed to the fire in an open vessel, it melts into a black mass very like a bitumen. It \n",

      "was one of the most eminent fathers of the church in the fourth century. He was a citizen of Rome, and born in France; according to some historians, in the year 334, but, according to others, in 340. The birth of Ambrose is said to have been attended with a remarkable presage of his future eloquence, by a swarm of bees settling upon his mouth as he lay in his cradle. At the period of his birth his father was pretorian prefect of Gallia Narbonensis; but upon his death, the widow repaired to Rome with her family. Ambrose received a religious education, and was reared in habits of virtuous conduct by his mother, an accomplished woman, and eminent for her piety. The names of his instructors in the rudiments of Greek and Roman literature have not been transmitted to posterity; but in these branches he made early proficiency; and, having directed his attention to the law, he employed his eloquence with such reputation in the pretorian court of Anicius Probus, that he was soon deemed worthy of a place in the council. After he had continued in this station for some time, Probus appointed him consular of Liguria and Emilia, comprehending the territories of Milan, Liguria, Turin, Genoa, and Bologna. Milan was chosen for the place of his residence; and, by the prudent and gentle use of his power, he conducted the affairs of the province with general approbation and growing popularity.\n",
      "In the year 374 Auxentius, the bishop of that city, died, and his death gave sudden change to the fortune and literary pursuits of Ambrose. At that period the tide of religious contention ran high between the Catholics and the Arians, and there ensued a violent contest concerning the choice of a new bishop. When the people were assembled in the church to elect, Ambrose, in the character of governor of the place, presented himself to the assembly, and in a grave, eloquent, and pathetic address, admonished the multitude to lay aside their contentions, and, in the spiritof religious meekness, to proceed to the importantwork of choosing a bishop. It is reported, that when Ambrose had finished his address, a child cried out, “Ambrose is bishop.” The agitated multitude suddenly caught the superstitious flame, and regarding this as a miraculous intimation, they unanimously elected Ambrose bishop of Milan. Some suppose that this was entirely a device of Ambrose or his friends, and others ascribe it to mere accident. Ambrose strongly affected reluctance, and even pretended to fly from the city in order to avoid the intended honour. It is, however, unfortunate for the artifice of the governor, that the place of his concealment was soon discovered, when the emperor’s confirmation of his election was made known to him. Finding it inconvenient any longer to resist the public choice, he exchanged the ensigns of civil for those of ecclesiastical dignity; and, after being baptized, he was ordained bishop of Milan, about the end of the year 374. But whatever may be the sentiments of mankind concerning the singular conduct of Ambrose in accepting an office for which he was certainly unqualified in respect of previous studies, habits, and employments, yet it must be admitted, that he immediately betook himself to the necessary studies, and acquitted himself in his new elevation with ability, boldness, and integrity. Having appropriated his money to the poor, settled his lands upon the church, with the exception of making his sister tenant during life, and having committed the care of his family to his brother, he entered upon a regular course of theological study, under the care of Simplician, a presbyter o Rome, and devoted himself to the labours of the chur ∙\n",
      "Compelled by the irruption of the Goths and the northern barbarians, who rushed down upon the Roman empire, spreading terror and desolation all around, Ambrose, along with several others, fled to Illyricum; but * lιs e ile was of short duration, for the northern invaders a ing been quickly defeated by the forces of the e , m P er °∙' and driven back with considerable loss into their o nions, he and his companions returned to their resρ tive habitations.\n",

      "After his return to.the ecclesiastic station, his eloquence and abilities found ample scope in the dispute between the Arians and Catholics. About this era the doctrine of Arius concerning the person of Christ had been extensively received, and had many powerful defenders both among the clergy and the common people. Ambrose espoused the cause of the Catholics: Gratian, the son of the elder Valen-fmian, marshalled on the same side; but the younger Va-lentinian, who was now become his colleague in the empire, adopted the opinions óf the Arians; and all the arguments and eloquence of Ambrose were insufficient to reclaim the young prince to the orthodox faith. Theodosius, the emperor of the East, also professed the orthodox faith; yet there were numerous adherents to Arius scattered throughout his dominions. In this distracted state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, Palladius and Sccundianus, confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of that empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation; but Ambrose, aware of the consequence, had the eloquence to persuade the emperor that a general council was improper, and that the matter could be determined by a council of the western bishops. The result was, that a synod, composed of 32 bishops, was held at Aquileia in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president; and Palladius being called upon to defend his opinions, declined, insisting that the meeting was a partial one, and that the whole bishops of the empire not being present, the sense of the Christian church concerning the question in dispute could not be obtained. Ambrose mentioned several precedents in favour of the authority of the court; and added, that the oriental bishops, being acquainted with the place and nature of the meeting, might have been present, if they had deemed the matter in discussion worthy of their attention; therefore the court, although Palladius persisted in his refusal ŧö plead his cause, put the vote, and he, along with his associate Secundianus, was ejected from the episcopal office. If Ambrose displayed great ardour in opposing the errors of Arius, he was equally zealous in combating the heathen superstitions. Upon the accession of Valentinian II., many of the senators who remained attached to the pagan idolatry made a vigorous effort to restore the worship of the heathen deities. Symmachus, a very opulent man and a great orator, who was at that time prefect of the city, was intrusted with the management of the pagan cause, and drew up a petition, praying that the altar of Victory might be restored to its ancient station in the hall of the senate, and for the proper support of seven vestal virgins, and the regular observance of the other pagan ceremonies. Great eloquence and peculiar insinuation characterized the petition. He argued that this form of religion had long been profitable to the Roman state, reminded the emperor how much Rome had been indebted to Victory, and that it had been the uniform custom of the senators to swear fidelity to the government upon that altar. He likewise produced many facts to prove the advantages derived to the state from its ancient religious institutions, and insinuated that it was one divinity that all men worshipped under different forms, so that ancient practice should not be rashly laid aside. He even proceeded so far as to state the injustice of increasing the public revenue by robbing the church, and attributed the late famine which had overtaken the empire to the neglect of the ancient worship.\n",
      "To this petition Ambrose replied in a letter to Valen-t∣nιan, arguing that the devoted worshippers of idols had often been forsaken by their deities; that the native valour °f the Roman soldiers had gained their victories, and not the pretended influence of pagan priests; that these idolatrous worshippers requested for themselves what they refused to Christians; that voluntary was more honourable than constrained virginity; that as the Christian ministers declined receiving temporal emoluments, they should also be denied to pagan priests; that it was absurd to suppose that God would inflict a famine upon the empire for neglecting to support a religious system contrary to his revealed will in the Scriptures; that the whole process of nature encouraged innovations, and that all nations had permitted these, even in religion; that heathen sacrifices were exceedingly offensive to Christians; and that every Christian prince should suppress these pagan ceremonies.\n",
      "In the epistles of Symmachus and of Ambrose both the petition and the reply are preserved, in which sophistry, superstition, sound sense, and solid argument, are strangely blended. It is scarcely necessary to add, that the petition was unsuccessful.\n",
      "The increasing strength of the Arians proved too formidable for the zealous Ambrose. The young emperor and Justina, along with a considerable number of clergy and laity professing the Arian faith, requested from the bishop the use of two churches, one in the city, the other in the suburbs of Milan. The prelate believing the bishops to be the guardians both of the temporal and spiritual interests of the church, and that the religious edifices were the unquestionable property of the church, positively refused to deliver up the temples of the Lord into the impious hands of the heretics. Filled with indignation, Justina resolved to employ the imperial authority of her son in procuring by force what she could not procure by persuasion. Ambrose was required to answer for his conduct before the council. He went, attended by a numerous crowd of people, whose impetuous zeal so overawed the ministers of Valentinian, that he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was \n",

      "in ancient architecture, a building of an elliptic form, of two or more stories of open arcades, with a number of interior galleries and arched passages, which served both as a communication and support to several rows of seats which rose above each other, and were arranged round a large space called the arena. The derivation of the word amphitheatre indicates that it is a place where the spectators, circuitously arranged, saw the performance equally well on all sides.\n",
      "The history of amphitheatres is of considerable importance, in consequence of its connection with ancient manners. These structures owed their origin to the barbarity of the ancients, and their ruin to the humanity of the moderns. They are the production of Roman invention in the last ages of the republic. The Romans were immoderately fond of every amusement of a bloody and horrible nature. Their rulers improved this general feature in the Roman character, to rouse and foster that martial spirit which rendered them masters of the world. After the Samnite war had extended the Roman sceptre over Etruria and the whole peninsula of Italy, the first gladiatory conflicts were exhibited in Rome in the year of the city 490. Lucius Metellus brought into the circus the elephants which were part of the spoil of the Carthaginians, in the year 502, and this proved the introduction of wild beasts into the spectacles of Rome. This addition λvas equally agreeable to the Roman taste; and those who courted the popular favour vied with each other in entertaining the people in this barbarous manner. This soon gave birth to a profession of men denominated gladiators, who were trained to the combat, and for reward slaughtered one another in the forum, whilst every devouring animal which the wilds of Asia or Africa produced added to the horrid scene.\n",
      "In the days of Pompey and Caesar these barbarous amusements were given with an astonishing profusion. In these games given by Pompey, the elephants attempted to break down the barrier between them and the people: this circumstance, and the form of the circus not enabling all the spectators to have a full view, induced Caesar to alter the original form, and construct edifices where the people might be entertained without danger or interruption. Amphitheatres were suited to this purpose; therefore they were adopted, and became the common place for the exhibitions both of gladiators and wild beasts.\n",
      "It is supposed that the first amphitheatre was composed of those singular machines, formed bv Caius Curio, for the games which Caesar presented among the funeral honours of his father. In a semicircular form Caius made two large theatres, and opposed their backs to each other; and having amused the people in these the one half of the day, then they wheeled round, forming one spacious theatre, where the gladiators contended during the remainder of the day. Pliny is the only one who makes mention of this amphitheatre; and from his account it is difficult to ascertain whether this was the first idea of an amphitheatre, or whether the previous sight of one had suggested this huge and wonderful structure. It is reported that Julius Caesar, a few years after, formed a hunting theatre of wood; and, in consequence of the circular position of the seats, it obtained the name of anβwι- phitheatre. This appears to have been of a very superior kind, and in great estimation.\n",
      "In the reign of Augustus, Statilius Taurus erected one of stone, but it seems to have been seldom used; and, from its being consumed by fire in the time of Nero, it is evident that it was not wholly of stone. These wooden buildings appear to have been generally temporary, but a few of them permanent, from the establishment conferred upon them. The politic spirit of Augustus induced him to erect several of these; and Caligula began one, which he left unfinished. Nero formed a large and spacious one, which is said to have been a year in building. Herod of Judaea erected amphitheatres both in Jerusalem and in Caesarea. During the reign of Tiberius, one was built at Fidenae, which Tacitus informs us fell while the games were performing, and slew or hurt about 50,000 persons. There was another at Placentia, reported to have been the most spacious in Italy; but it was destroyed by fire in the contest between Vitellius and Otho.\n",
      "The unfortunate accidents which happened to these wooden buildings led to the construction of others of a more durable and stronger nature, where the crowd might be entertained without danger. This honour was reserved to Vespasian and Titus. In his eighth consulate the former began the amphitheatre, which the latter finished during his reign. It is said that the expense of this building would have erected a capital city, and it is deservedly esteemed one of the most celebrated edifices of ancient times. Dio says, that 9000 wild beasts were destroyed at the dedication of this huge building, but Eutropius restricts their number to 5000. After the hunting of these ferocious animals was ended, instantly the arena was filled with water, and sea animals were made to contend, and a sea-fight exhibited. This immense building obtained the appellation of the Coliseum.\n",
      "This amphitheatre became the model of other amphitheatres throughout the empire. Compared with the original model, these were natural valleys, with seats formed in the surrounding heights similar to the amphitheatre at Corinth. On the declivity of two hills seats of stones were sometimes placed, and the extremes formed by regular works of stone. Of this kind was that of Gortyna in Candia. One in the vicinity of Sandwich in Kent had its benches formed of turf; and similar must have been those amphitheatres which were formed along with the camps and military stations of the Roman soldiers.\n",
      "When Christianity became the religion of the empire, it meliorated the dispositions of the Romans, and induced them to lay aside this barbarous custom. Constantine the Great terminated the gladiatory combats in the east during his reign; but they were not finally abolished at Rome until the beginning of the fifth century, in the reign of Honorius. The combats of wild beasts continued, however, some time longer; but during tlιe progress of the fifth century these gradually declined, until they were finally abolished, and the amphitheatres were abandoned to the ravages of time and accident. During the middle ages they were sometimes employed for judicial conflicts, tilts, and tournaments; but these practices having been discontinued, the amphitheatres experienced universal neglect and ruin.\n",
      "It is scarcely possible to give a clear idea of the manner in which such immense crowds of people were seated and arranged, and how they had a convenient entrance and a returning. It has already been mentioned, that these buildings were circuitous, and that the exterior circuit was composed of two or more stories of arcades; and it may now be added, that the number of these stories varied according to the nature of the building. A corresponding number of arched passages and staircases opened upon the ground floor towards these stories, in the direction of radii towards the arena. These communications were again intersected by arched passages, which encircled the whole structure, and afforded an uninterrupted entrance to every part of the amphitheatre. Sometimes an intermediate gallery surrounded the whole in the centre of the fabric, and served as a common place of resort to all the stairs which led to the higher galleries. This was the form of one at Nismes. Sometimes each staircase had its distinct communication by itself. Such was the case with one at Verona.\n",
      "The four radiating entries on the diameter were usually more capacious; and by the two principal of these the emperor, the senate, and other persons of distinction, were conducted to their seats on a place which was called the podium. The other two led to the arena, and by these the gladiators and beasts made their entrance. The various ranks of the people passed by the staircases, which led to their respective seats. The doors which opened from the staircases were called vomitories, and varied in magnitude, according to the extent of the amphitheatre and the number of exterior arches. The number of seats between the several vomitories was unequal, and seems to have been subject to no positive regulation. These benches were about one foot and eight inches in height, and about two feet four inches in breadth. A platform four feet eight inches broad was formed of one of these benches, which served as a circular communication to the whole building. These obtained the name of precinctions, and the boundaries on the side were called belts. The latter were surrounded by balustrades, to protect the persons from falling who occupied the benches in the vicinity. The podium was more spacious than the precinctions, and was a platform encircling the arena. From one precinction to the belt of another, a flight of stairs two feet six inches in breadth descended opposite to every vomitory. Small canals were cut in the tops of the benches, by which the rain and urine were conducted from bench to bench, until they reached the instruments prepared to convey them to the drains below. These stairs radiated from the highest bench to the podium; so that, with the precinctions, they separated the whole cavity into wedge-like divisions, which the people occupied according to their rank.\n",
      "The amphitheatre called the Coliseum was of an elliptical form, whose longest diameter was about 615 English feet six inches, and the shortest 510. The length of the diameter of the arena was about 281 feet, and the breadth 176, reserving a space for the seats and galleries of about 157 feet in breadth. The external circumference covered a superficies of about five acres and a half, and could scarcely be included in a parallelogram of seven acres.

      "These organs, by the possession of which the individuals of the human race are distinguished into two sexes, male and female, consist in the former of impregnating, and in the latter of the impregnable organs. The former may be again distinguished into preparing and transmitting Organs; and the latter into receiving and ootrophic organs, or those which nourish the product of generation.\n",
      "CHAP. I. — THE MALE OR IMPREGNATING ORGANS.\n",
      "The male organs consist of two glandular organs, named testicles with excretory ducts, for secreting the impregnating fluid, and an organ for transmitting it to those of the female.\n",
      "The testicles (testes') are two ovoidal bodies contained on each side of tne mesial plane in a cutaneo-cellular sac named the scrotum, attached to the anterior inferior part of the pubal symphysis.\n",
      "The scrotum consists of skin with very thin corion, resting on loose filamentous tissue, which forms on the mesial plane a thick wall, separating the right half of the scrotal bag from the left. On the median line is a superficial groove, named suture (raphe), at which the corion and filamentous tissue, elsewhere loose, are united into a solid and firm substance. Most of the old anatomists mention a muscular layer known by the name of dartos, and to which they ascribe the contraction of the scrotum on exposure to cold; but the existence of this muscular layer is not supported by inspection. The scrotal skin is well Supplied with arteries, and especially veins connected with those of the epigastric, external iliac, femoral, obturator, and external pudic, the branches of which anastomose freely. The nerves are from the lumbar, obturator, and crural.\n",
      "The scrotal filamentous tissue incloses on each side a thin membranous sac of a pyriform shape, with the base below, and tapering to a neck above. Adherent on the outside to the filamentous substance, this membranous sac is free and smooth within, except at the neck, where it embraces a part distinguished by the name of spermatic chord. This, which is the sheath-like or vaginal coat (tunica vaginalis), is distinguished into two parts, an inferior pyriform, forming a cavity for the testicle, and a superior cylindrical, covering the spermatic chord, and adhering to it. This membrane is said to be fibrous externally; but it appears to be merely condensed filamentous tissue. Within it is evidently a transparent serous membrane, both in qualities and distribution. It is continued from the adherent part of the chord downward, and over the testicle.\n",
      "Within the cavity of the former are contained the testicles, both suspended by the spermatic chord, with the epididymis behind. Their substance is inclosed in a firm, opaque, white, fibrous investment, covered by a thin transparent membrane, reflected from the vaginal coat. The former is the tunica albuginea, or proper tissue of the gland; the latter is the vaginal coat of the testicle (tunica vaginalis testis).\n",
      "The testicle consists of minute irregular-shaped granules, of a white or gray-white colour, soft, closely compacted, and with numerous capillaries distributed through them. More minutely examined, these are found to be capillary tubes of extraordinary length, folded on themselves, and contorted so as to occupy a small space, and when unfolded extending, according to some anatomists, 16 feet, according to others to 25 or even 100 ells. These long tortuous tubes, which are named the seminiferous (ductus seminiferi), are estimated at about 300 in number. They communicate by one extremity with the bloodvessels and lymphatics of the testicle, and by the other, after several unite into one common duct, terminate in about 20 larger tubes, denominated egredient ducts (vasa efferentia), which, united in a cluster by means of filamentous tissue, and invested by part of the tunica albuginea, form at the upper part of the gland a whitish cylindrical body, about six lines long and two broad, distinguished by the name of the process of Highmore (corpus Highmori). These efferent vessels unite and form a single' tube of great length, which, folded on itself by innumerable turns, connected by filamentous tissue, and invested by tunica albuginea, constitutes the epididymis, attached by its head to the testicle, and by an incurvated extremity∣ named tail, continuous with the common excretory duct (vas deferens).\n",
      "The latter is a long fibro-cartilagĩnous tube, ascending upwards from the tail of the epididymis, and making part of the spermatic chord, with which it enters the abdomen at the inguinal aperture. At the inner margin of this it separates from the chord, and descends into the pelvis, first by the side, then at the posterior and inferior fundus of the bladder; and, approaching that of the opposite side with the vesicula seminalis on the outer margin, each vas deferens is in contact with the other at the base of the prostate gland. Here each receiving a tube from the corresponding vesicula, forms a common duct (ductus ejaculans), which traverses the prostate, and terminates in the urethra about one inch and a half from its vesical end, on each side of the eminence named veτu-montanum.\n",
      "The spermatic chord, by which the testicle is suspended, consists of the spermatic artery or its divisions, derived in general from the aorta, two or three spermatic veins, several lymphatics, and the vas deferens, inclosed in filamentous tissue, and covered by a slip of muscular fibres denominated the suspensory muscle (cremaster, tunica erythroides), detached partly from the internal oblique and transverse of the belly, fixed partly at the inner surface of the ligament of Poupart and the tuberosity of the pubis.\n",
      "The spermatic artery divaricates into several branches, which are distributed, after a few sent to the epididymis, among the seminiferous ducts. They communicate with numerous tortuous veins, which are collected into a cluster known by the name of the pampiniform body, situate immediately below the tunica albuginea.\n",
      "Below the inferior fundus of the bladder, on the outside of that organ, are placed two bodies, oblong, flattened, pyriform, with the base behind, composed at first sight of a series of cells separated by septa. Each of these bodies, which have been named the seminal vesicles (vesiculae seminales), consists of a long tortuous membranous tube, convoluted on itself, and with the folds aggregated by bridles of filamentous tissue, which convert it into communicating sacs. The cavity of this canal, which communicates with the urethra by a tube, common to the vesicles and the vasa deferentia, has been supposed to serve as a reservoir for the seminal fluid after secretion by the testicles; but this supposition is by no means verified, and is open to several objections.\n",
      "The transmitting organs consist of the penis with the urethra and prostate gland.\n",
      "The penis, the shape of which is well known, consists, of two parts, the cavernous body (corpus cavernosum), and the spongy body (corpus spongiosum) containing the urethra. The cavernous body, single before, bifurcated behind, may be described as two cylindrical bodies, inclosed in a fibrous investment, which, uniting them on the mesial plane, forms a partition (septum medium), perforated nevertheless with orifices for vessels. The divaricating posterior extremities (crura) are firmly attached to the ιschio-pubal rami on each side. The intermediate triangular interval is occupied by the perineal filamentous tissue, fat, the perineal muscles, and the spongy body in the middle. Above and before, both are connected to the pubal symphysis by a triangular, flat, fibrous substance, named the triangular or suspensory ligament.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spongy body is a cylindrical cellulo-vascular tube, inclosing the urethra, and occupying the middle depression, along the lower surface of the cavernous body, from ’its anterior extremity, where it constitutes the glans, to the angular bifurcation of the cavernous body, where it is expanded into a substance denominated the bulb of the urethra. The spongy body is invested on the side and below by integuments only.\n",
      "Both these parts, but especially the cavernous body, consist of numerous minute arteries, communicating directly with elongated and dilatable veins, and constitute the best example of erectile arrangement in the body. The injection of these vessels constitutes the erection of the penis, and induces the contraction of the urethra necessary to expel the seminal fluid. The two extremities of the spongy body, the glans before and the bulb behind, form the limits of the erectile tissue round the urethra. The anterior extremity is covered by loose skin, which forms the foreskin (prceputium), and, in the shape of a thin semimucous corion, provided with epidermis, is continued over the glans, from which it passes insensibly into the mucous membrane of the urethra.\n",
      "With the penis several muscular organs are connected. The ischio-cavernosus and transversus perinoei on each side connect the cavernous body to the ischium; and the bulbο-cavemοsus connects it to the bulb of the urethra. Mr Houston of Dublin has lately discovered a packet of muscular fibres situate between the pubal arch and the penis on each side, which, by compressing the dorsal vein, may, he imagines, contribute to erect the organ.\n",
      "The cavernous and spongy bodies are supplied with blood from the terminal end of the internal pudic artery, by means of two vessels, the cavernous and the dσrsal. The bulb receives branches from the transverse perineal artery.\n",
      "The prostate gland is a body cordiform or flat conoidal in shape, with the base behind and the apex before, corresponding to the vesical end of the urethra, situate behind the pubal symphysis before, and below the neck of the bladder, in the angle between it and the rectum, and between the levator ani of each side.\n",

      "D. The subject of this article, who has been brought into notice principally from the more recent encouragement given to agriculture, and the versatility of his own genius, was born at the village of Hermiston, in the county of Edinburgh, in the year 1739. His parents were in humble life, and had possessed a farm for some generations, which he was destined to inherit and to cultivate. At that period improvement was in infancy, and the husbandman had to contend with a climate whose uncertainty seemed to keep pace with the progress of his skill, and which too often disappointed him of the fruits of his industry. Anderson, while yet at an early age, lost his parents: however, his education was uninterrupted; and conceiving that an acquaintance with chemistry would promote his profession, he attended a course of lectures on that science, then delivered by Dr Cullen. None of the other pupils besides himself took notes of his lectures, which being afterwards surreptitiously obtained from him, with the design of publication, he defeated the intended purpose, apprehensive that his preceptor’s fame might be diminished by these imperfect transcripts. His own active occupations had already commenced, and, along with the practice of husbandry, he prosecuted his original taste for literature.\n",
      "Enlarging the sphere of his employments, Anderson forsook his first possession, for a farm of 1300 acres, which he rented in Aberdeenshire, though nearly in a state of nature, and where agriculture is still behind the southern districts. But previous to this he became known to men of letters, by some essays on planting, which, under the signature Agricola, he ventured to commit to the world through the medium of the Edinburgh Weekly Magazine, in 1771. Soon embarking in a higher sphere of literature, he composed the article Monsoon for the first edition of this Encyclopaedia, in 1773, wherein he threw out some luminous ideas, and, among other observations, predicted from physical facts, and the state of geographical knowledge, that no polar continent would be found by the circumnavigators then employed by government. In the year 1777 he published a considerable quarto volume, said to have been composed two years preceding, on the means of exerting a spirit of national industry with regard to agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and fisheries; and in this he enters into detailed views of many subjects of political economy. The interest of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland is in a particular manner considered; and the author maintains, that the only effectual means of increasing agriculture is by promoting manufactures; as also, that the neglect∙which the agriculture of these parts of the kingdom experienced, resulted from the neglect of manufactures. Scotland, he affirms, is better adapted than England for the production of wool; and this, as well as other products, he thought, would be best encouraged by premiums. The advantages which might result from attending to the fisheries, he judged, would be very great, and the shoals of herrings frequenting the coast could be converted into a source of national wealth under suitable establishments. Anderson, who soon after had die degree of doctor of laws conferred on him by the University of Aberdeen, did not abandon these inquiries. He printed a tract regarding the fisheries, which was circulated among his friends; and, in consequence of being more widely diffused, he was appointed by the Lords of the Treasury to survey the western coast of Scotland, for the purpose of obtaining satisfactory information on the subject. This he did in 1784, and received the full approbation of his employers; and he published a brief account of the Hebrides, a chain of islands then as little within the general acquaintance of the inhabitants of Great Britain as if they had been under the dominion of another country. The principal obstacles to the fishery, Dr Anderson considered, were to be found in a duty on salt and coals, and he recommended the repeal of both. It is certain that, from thenceforward, this great branch of national industry has received infinitely more patronage than before his report, and, while we only shared the labours of the Dutch for centuries, the fisheries on our own coast have since been monopolized by ourselves. Nothing can be more impolitic than to fetter the exertions of the industrious by exorbitant duties, or equally oppressive with denying fuel to the poorer classes, where it is scarce, by duties on its importation.\n",
      "Dr Anderson had now withdrawn from his northern farm, where he resided above 20 years, and settled in the vicinity of Edinburgh. His agricultural speculations were still continued; and when a parliamentary grant was about to be proposed to Mr Elkington for a particular mode of draining land, he reclaimed the practice as having been observed by himself many years anterior. Repeated examples, indeed, prove that the rewards granted by Parliament for improvement are attended with such slight investigations, that the merits of real invention are overlooked. Dr Anderson now projected a periodical publication called The Bee, consisting of miscellaneous original matter, which attained the extent of 18 volumes in octavo. It was published weekly, and a large proportion of it came from his own pen, which is seldom a prudent course in an editor. The relation of Great Britain and her colonies, and the political rights of mankind—subjects which had excited strong interests throughout Europe—also received some commentaries from Dr Anderson. He wrote a tract called The Interest of Great Britain with respect to her Colonies, and commenced a correspondence with General Washington, which was afterwards published.\n",
      "Towards the year 1797 he again removed to Islesworth, in the neighbourhood of London, where he undertook another periodical publication, appearing at more distant intervals than the former, entitled Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History, Arts, and Miscellaneous Literature. This work was prefaced by two copious dissertations, the one on agriculture, the other on natural history; and opened with a discussion regarding a very curious and important subject, namely, an inquiry into what are denominated varieties in plants and animals. Many useful and interesting remarks appear in the course of this publication, a portion of which was supplied by other contributors; and it is embellished by beautiful vignettes from engravings on wood. Owing to some difficulties attending the publication, it ceased in 1802. Though natural history is rather predominant, the rest of his leading subjects are not overlooked. Dr Anderson henceforward lived in a great measure in retirement, though occasionally reminding the world of his wonted inquiries, by the publication of tracts on unconnected subjects. He obtained a patent for an improved hot-house, wherein no fuel was used; and employed himself in experiments regarding the degree of temperature and humidity most beneficial to plants. Likewise, having observed the uncommon depredations of wasps, he is said, after satisfying himself of their manner of increase, to have devised a plan for their absolute extermination. This was chiefly by the destruction of the females before founding their respective colonies by the depositation of innumerable eggs; and hand-bills were circulated under the auspices of an association formed by him, offering a reward for every female brought in dead within a specified time. It does not appear, however, that the breed was at all diminished by the proposed expedient.\n",
      "Dr Anderson still remained in his retreat, enjoying the cultivation of his garden; and nothing of importance is known to have proceeded from his pen. After a gradual decline, partly occasioned by the over-exertion of the mental.energies, he died in the year 1808, aged 69. He was twice married; first, to Miss Seton of Mounie; secondly» to an English lady. By his first marriage he had thirteen children, six of whom survived him. One of his sons made distinguished progress in the art of engraving on wood; and, if the vignettes of the Recreations in Agriculture were executed by him, they afford ample testimony of his abilities.\n",
      "Dr Anderson was endowed with a vigorous understanding, which he chiefly displayed in treating of agricultural matters, and those connected with rural economy; but he was at the same time of a versatile talent, which could readily be occupied on transient facts and occurrences. Many of his works were of a fugitive nature, consisting of small impressions, which were not renewed, and hence are difficult to be obtained at present, if they have not totally disappeared. None of them soars to the more lofty regions of science; they are directed to practical views in useful projects, and for the most part relate to subjects of ordinary detail. Of this the reader will be enabled to judge by the subjoined list, which we believe is the most copious that has yet appeared. The industry of Dr Anderson was indefatigable, whether in personal exertion or mental energy; and he possessed elevated sentiments of independence. During a period of overstrained political fervour, certain papers formed part of the periodical works already referred to, which were thought libellous on the government. Although Dr Anderson’s principles were noted for attachment to the existing administration, he was called upon to give up the author of the obnoxious compositions, which he steadily refused, and, even in the face of the civil magistrates, charged his printers not to violate their fidelity to him and the author in betraying his name. The business terminated here, until a factious individual insinuated to the same magistrates that the compositions had proceeded from one of the supreme judges, whose party politics were avowedly hostile to those of government. Dr Anderson having learned the reproach, hastened to relieve the object of it by divulging the name of the r\n",

      "a city of Scotland, in the county of Fife, pleasantly situated in a spacious bay of the German Ocean, into which flow the river Eden, the small rivulet of Kinness, and several other streams. It was formerly a place of much greater extent and importance. At present it is only about a mile and a half in circuit, and consists of three leading streets, intersected by a few considerable lanes. The principal street is well built, and is straight and broad, and of late years its appearance has been much improved. The town contains many interesting memorials of antiquity. Of the splendid cathedral, which was founded by Bishop Arnold in 1159, and attained to its highest magnificence in 1318, part of the east and west ends, and of the south side, are all that now remain. The length of this edifice from east to west was 350 feet within the walls; that of the transept 180 feet. This whole pile of building, which it took 150 years to complete, was in June 1559 demolished in a single day by John Knox and his infuriated followers. About 40 yards to the south-east is the chapel of St Regulus, the tower of which is a lofty square prism, the side of the base being 20 feet, and the height 108. The chapel to the east of the tower, which was the principal one, remains; but of a small chapel to the west, which formerly existed, there is now no trace. The arches of the windows and doors are round, and the figure of some of them is more than half of the circle, which is an undoubted proof of their antiquity. The priory, which was founded by Robert, bishop of St Andrews, during the reign of Alexander I. in 1120, was of great extent, and richly endowed. The prior had precedence of all abbots and priors, and on festival days had a right to wear a mit re and all episcopal ornaments. The walls of the pre-cìncŧ are all that now remain to mark the vast extent of this edifice. Part of the top of the great altar towards z the east end of the cathedral was discovered between 30 and 40 years ago, in consequence of an excavation made in the hope of finding concealed treasure. At a much more recent period, the soil, which had for ages been permitted to accumulate, having been removed, part of the pavement was laid open, and several shafts of two rows of pillars parallel to each other, by which it is supposed that galleries in the inside of the walls had been supported. The other religious houses were, that of the Dominicans, founded in 1274 by Bishop Wishart; another of Observantines, founded by Bishop Kennedy, and finished by his successor Patrick Graham in 1478; and, according to some, the Carmelites had a fourth. Immediately above the harbour stood the collegiate church of Kirk-heugh, originally founded by Constantine III., who, retiring from the world, became here a Culdee. From its having been first built on a rock, it was styled Proepositura Sanctae Mariae de Rupe.\n",
      "On the east side of the city are the remains of the castle, on a rock overlooking the sea. This fortress was founded about the year 1200, by Roger, one of the bishops of St Andrews, and was repaired towards the end of the 14th century by Bishop Trail, who died in it in 1401. He was buried near the high altar of the cathedral, with this singular epitaph:\n",
      "Hic fuit ecclesiae directa columna, fenestra Lucida, thuribulum redolens, campana sonora.\n",
      "The castle was the residence of Cardinal Beaton, who, after the cruel execution of the celebrated reformer George Wishart in front of it, was afraid of the fury of the people; and his knowledge of this, joined to his apprehension of an invasion from England, induced him to strengthen the fortifications, with a view of rendering the castle impregnable. In this fortress he was surprised and assassinated by Norman Lesley, aided by fifteen others. Early in the morning of May 29, 1546, they seized on the gate of the castle, which had been left open for the workmen who were finishing the fortifications; and having placed sentinels at the door of the cardinal’s apartment, they awakened his numerous domestics one by one, and, turning them out of the castle, without violence, tumult, or injury to any other person, inflicted on Beaton the death he justly merited. The conspirators were immediately besieged in this castle by the regent, earl of Arran; and although their strength consisted of only 150 men, they resisted his efforts for five months, owing more to the unskilfulness of the attack than the strength of the place, for in 1547 the castle was reduced and demolished, and its picturesque ruins serve as a land-mark to mariners. The entrance to the castle, and the window out of which it is said Cardinal Beaton leaned to witness the cruel martyrdom of George Wishart, are still pointed out.\n",
      "The parish church is a spacious structure, 162 feet in length by 63 in breadth, and is large enough to accommodate 2500 persons. It contains a lofty monument of white marble, erected in honour of Archbishop Sharpe, who, in revenge for his oppressive conduct, was murdered by some of the exasperated reformers of that day. On this monument is a rude piece of sculpture representing the tragical scene of the murder. To the north is situated the college church, which belongs to the united college of St Salvator and St Leonard. It was founded in 1458 by Bishop Kennedy, and contains a beautiful tomb of its rounder, who died in 1466; which is a fine specimen of leftθ 0t ^ 1 * c architecture of that period. About the year 683, on opening this tomb, six highly ornamented silver maces Were discovered, which had been concealed there in times of trouble, three of which are still preserved iņ the university, and three were sent to the other universities of Scotland. On the top is represented our Saviour; around are angels with the instruments of his passion. With these are shown some silver arrows, with large silver plates affixed to them, on which are inscribed the arms and names of those who were victors in the annual competitions of archery, which were regularly held until within these few years. Golf is now the reigning game. That sport, and foot-ball, were formerly prohibited by an act of parliament passed in the reign of James II. in 1457, as interfering too much with the acquisition of dexterity in archery, an accomplishment in those days of much consequence to the safety of the state. The statute has been long obsolete, and the inhabitants, and the students who attend the university, have full permission to enjoy this elegant amusement.\n",
      "The celebrated university of this city was founded in 1411 by Bishop Wardlaw. It consisted formerly of three colleges. 1. St Salvator’s was founded in 1458 by Bishop Kennedy. This was a handsome building, with a court or quadrangle, which is 230 feet long by 150 wide, and a gateway surmounted by a spire 156 feet high. On one side is the church; on another what was the library of St Salvator’s; the third contains apartments for students; the fourth is unfinished. The buildings connected with the college being in a state of great decay, a grant has been made by government for erecting a new structure. Part of this building will soon be finished, and the remainder, it is expected, will be immediately after commenced. When it is completed it will be in a high degree elegant and commodious. 2. St Leonard’s College was founded by Prior Hepburn in 1522. This is now united with the last, and the buildings sold, and converted into private houses. 3. New or St Mary’s College was established by Archbishop Hamilton in 1552; but the house was completed by Archbishop Beaton. This is said to have been the site of a celebrated school long before the establishment even of the university, where several eminent clergymen taught gratis the sciences and languages; but it was called the New College, because of its late erection into a divinity college by the archbishop. The buildings of this college have been substantially repaired, and with great taste.\n",
      "The university is governed by a chancellor,—an office which it was originally intended should be permanently exercised by the archbishop of St Andrews. Subsequent to the Reformation, the chancellor has been elected by the two principals and the professors of both colleges.\n",
      "The rector is the next great officer, to whose care are committed the privileges, discipline, and statutes of the university. The colleges have their principals, and professors of different sciences, who are indefatigable in their attention to the instruction and the morals of the students. The place possesses, in its pure and salubrious air, and in its extensive grounds for exercise, very great advantages for the education of youth. In St Salvator’s College are taught the languages, philosophy, and the sciences. St Mary’s, which stands in a different part of the town, is reserved exclusively for theology. The classes and discipline of the two colleges are quite distinct, each having its respective principal and professors. They have a common library, which is entitled to a copy of every work entered in Stationers Hall, and which now (1830) contains upwards of 40,000 volumes. An addition has been in the course of last season made to the library, which was much required, in consequence of the great increase of the number of books.\n",
      "Seventy-five bursaries or endowments belong to the university, and are conferred on the students. Of these, 58 belong to the United, and 17 to the New College. The number of students at St Andrews never exceeded 300 at any period. During the present year (1830) they amount to 190 at both colleges—149 at the United College, 41 at St Mary’s.\n",
      "The trade of St Andrews was once very considerable. So late as the reign of Charles I. it had thirty or forty trading vessels, and carried on a considerable herring and white fishery, by means of busses, in deep water, which had for ages been a most profitable branch of commerce, and a source of wealth. During the troubles which followed the death of this monarch, this whole coast,\n",

      "an extensive coast and territory of Western Africa, extending to the south of the river Congo or Zaire. According to Degrandpré, the name is given to he whole coast, from Cape Lopez Gonsalvo, in 0.44. to St Phelipe de Bengal, in lat. 12.14.S., a range of nearly 12 degrees, or about 800 miles. The country strictly called Angola, however, occupies only the middle part of this pace between Congo on the north and Benguela on the south, being watered by the large rivers Conan and Dando, to the former of which especially, the Portuguese maps assign a very long course through the interior; but neither of these rivers has been ascended to any considerable height.\n",
      "From the early Portuguese accounts, it would appear that Angola or Ngola was a title assumed by the kings, and transmitted by one to another from the original founder of their dynasty. The first Ngola was reported by tradition to have been raised to distinction by the skill with which he exercised the occupation of a smith; and though this mode of elevation may be somewhat foreign to our ideas, yet this trade is in its products so important to a warlike people, and in the infancy of art is attended with such difficulty, that among the nations of Africa generally it is held in peculiar honour. Ngola seems also b have secured the attachment of his countrymen by various benefits, particularly by forming a store of grain, from which, during periods of scarcity, he supplied their necessities. Among his successors, several were fierce nd warlike; one, in particular, named Chilivagni Angola, ready extended the boundaries of the kingdom, making it comprehend Matamba and great part of Benguela. His successor Bandi Angola, however, being hard pressed by the Giagas, a fierce and wandering tribe from the interior, applied for aid to the king of Congo, and was aided by a body of Portuguese, who were then established in that territory. Through their valour and discipline Bandi was enabled to repel the invaders, and was thus induced for some time to lavish on the strangers the highest honours. Becoming, however, jealous of their power, and perhaps disgusted with their haughty deportment, he formed a scheme to cut them off, which they escaped only partially, and by a very hasty flight. Returning to Portugal, they recommended very strongly Angola as a theatre both of commerce and conquest,—an advice highly accordant with the enterprising and ambitious views by which that court was then actuated.\n",
      "The river Congo had in 1484 been discovered, and in some degree explored, by Diego Cam; but his successors, Bartholomew Diaz and Vasco de Gama, when sailing along the coast to the southward, were solely intent on reaching and passing the dangerous cape which formed the utmost boundary of the African continent. After the splendid discoveries and settlements attempted to be formed on the coast of India, the Almeidas and the Al-buquerques pushed onwards to that region without allowing themselves to be detained by undertaking any settlements on this barbarous coast. The king, however, about the middle of the 16th century, sent out an armament under Paulo de Diaz, a descendant of Bartholomew, constituting him viceroy of all the territories which he should conquer in this part of Africa. Diaz landed, and established the Portuguese headquarters at a place which he called Loando St Paul, near the mouth of the Coanza; then proceeded with an armament up that river, and erected a fort on its banks, whence his troops began to spread over the surrounding country. The king, unable to brook such rivals to his power, assembled an army, which, with absurd exaggeration, is represented as exceeding 100,000 men. It was probably, indeed, much superior in numbers to the handful which the Portuguese could oppose to it; but such’was their superiority in arms and discipline, that both the king, and his son, who soon succeeded him, were beaten in successive encounters. At length there arrived, as ambassadress at the camp of the Portuguese, no less a person than the king’s sister, Zingha Bandi, whose manners and address struck them with surprise and a sort of admiration. They relate, that on being introduced to Don John, who had succeeded to the rank of viceroy, and seeing no chair provided for her, without making any complaint, she caused her attendant to bend down on her hands and knees, and made use of her back as a seat. A demand being made of vassalage and tribute, she rejected it with indignation; and it was finally agreed that both parties should remain in their present position, and a mutual exchange of prisoners take place,—terms which leave much room to doubt if the successes of the Portuguese were so decided as they chose to represent. Zingha, on the whole highly pleased with her reception, remained with them a considerable time, during which she became a convert to Christianity, and finally parted on the most friendly terms.\n",
      "The Portuguese were not long in receiving very unfavourable tidings of their new convert. By the murder of her brother and his son, she paved her way to the sovereignty; and then began, equally with her predecessors, to feel deep dissatisfaction at the great extent of valuable territory possessed by this foreign nation. Unable to hope for its recovery by fair means, she formed alliances with the neighbouring states, and even with the ferocious and formerly hostile tribe of Giagas; after which she commenced war, and for many years carried it on with the utmost fury, putting to death, amid the most cruel tortures, all Europeans who fell into her hands. The Portuguese boast of their numerous victories over Zingha; yet admit that they were often very hard pressed, and had at one time their whole force cooped up and closely besieged on an island in the Coanza. They were at the same time involved in war with the Dutch, who in 1641 took their principal settlement of St Paul de Loanđo, which was recovered, however, by an expedition sent thither on the 15th August 1648. As Zingha rejected all terms of peace which did not include the entire restoration of the conquered country, the Portuguese endeavoured to set up in opposition to her two successive members of the royal family, whom they called John I. and II.; but these phantom monarchs never enjoyed any weight with the people in general. At length the queen, haviňg attained to an advanced age, being no longer seconded by the Dutch, and finding all her efforts to expel the Portuguese abortive, listened to overtures of peace. She indignantly rejected any demand of homage, or of the most trifling tribute; and the treaty was concluded altogether on equal terms, except that she paid a high ransom for one of her sisters, who had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese. Permission was then obtained to send missionaries to her coast, who persuaded her to resume the profession of Christianity, which she had renounced during her long period of enmity; and, on the 15th July 1662, her union with the church of Rome was celebrated with extraordinary pomp.\n",
      "Zingha died at the age of eighty, and the crown then devolved on her sister’s husband Mona Zingha, who commenced a violent war against the Europeans, which was in a ' few years terminated by his death. Since that time the affairs of the Portuguese have been involved in that mystery which they studiously throw over all their colonial transactions; but it is not believed that they now occupy more than a very limited range of territory around their ports of St Paul de Loando and St Phelipe de Benguela, which they maintain for the purpose of carrying on the slave-trade.\n",
      "The whole of this coast, according to Degrandpré, to whom wc are indebted for the only recent account of it, has been singularly favoured by nature. The soil consists generally of a rich black loam, fitted for yielding in the utmost luxuriance all the productions of tropical climates. In its present uncultivated state, it is covered with dense and varied vegetation. The forests reach to the top of the hills, and their trunks are often washed by the waves. This vegetation bears generally the same character as in other parts of tropical Africa. Some of the trees, under the influence of heat and moisture on a rich soil, arrive at the most extraordinary dimensions. Mention is made of the mapou, which seems to be the same species with the calabash of Adanson, and whose trunk it has required a boat’s crew, with arms extended, to embrace. This huge production of nature is unfortunately incapable of being applied to any use whatever: the wood, moist and spongy, is fitted neither for carpentry nor even fuel; the fruit is small and unpalatable; the foliage too scanty to afford any grateful shade. On the other hand, the family of the palms are profusely distributed, and minister to the most important uses of human life. The cocoa-palm, in particular, serves almost every economical purpose.. Its juices afford both food and drink; its wood is hard and durable; its filaments form strong ropes; the leaves afford a roofing which resists the rain; even the rind of the fruit is made into vessels for domestic purposes. The date-palm exists, but the soil is too moist to produce it in abundance. The culinary vegetables of Europe, when planted, grow to an extraordinary size, but soon degenerate in a soil which appears foreign to their nature. Cultivation is confined to small spots resembling gardens, in the immediate vicinity of the towns and villages, leaving all the open country in a state of nature. Its efforts are chiefly bestowed on the manioc, plantations of which surround all the villages; and the root, ground down by a species of mill, and then dried in little furnaces, affords the bread generally used in the country.\n",
      "The animal races are numerous, all wild, and of the same species which generally prevail throughout Africa. Elephants are less numerous than in some other quarters; but hyaenas, ounces, and tiger-cats people the forests; and there are a\n",

      "----\n",
      "by the workmen called nealing, is a process used in glass-making, and in the manufacture of certain metals. In glass-making it consists in placing the bottles, &c. whilst hot, in a kind of oven or furnace, where they are suffered to cool gradually. They would otherwise be too brittle for use. The difference between unannealed and annealed glass, with respect to brittleness, is very remarkable. When an unannealed glass vessel is broken, it often flies into a small powder, with a violence seemingly very unproportioned to the stroke it has received. In general it is in greater danger of breaking from a very slight stroke than from one of some considerable force. One of these vessels will often resist the effects of a pistol bullet dropt into it from the height of two or three feet; yet a grain of sand falling into it will make it burst into small fragments. This takes place sometimes immediately on dropping the sand into it; but often the vessel will stand for several minutes after, seemingly secure; and then, without any new injury, it will fly to pieces. If the vessel be very thin, it does not break in this manner, but seems to possess all the properties of annealed glass.\n",
      "The same phenomena are still more strikingly seen in glass drops or tears. They are globular at one end, and taper to a small tail at the other. They are the drops which fall from the melted mass of glass on the rods on which the bottles are made. They drop into the tubs of water which are used in the work; the greater part of them burst immediately in the water. When those that remain entire are examined, they discover all the properties of unannealed glass in the highest degree. They will bear a smart stroke on the thick end without breaking; but if the small tail be broken, they burst into small powder with a loud explosion. They appear to burst with more violence, and the powder is smaller, in an exhausted receiver, than in the open air. When they are annealed they lose these properties.\n",
      "Glass is one of those bodies which increase in bulk when passing from a fluid to a solid state. When it is allowed to crystallize regularly, the particles are so arranged that it has a fibrous texture. It is elastic, and susceptible of long-continued vibrations; but when a mass of melted glass is suddenly exposed to the cold, the surface crystallizes, and forms a solid shell round the interior fluid parts. This prevents them from expanding when they become solid. They therefore have not the opportunity of a regular crystallization, but are compressed together with little mutual cohesion. On the contrary, they press outward to occupy more space, but are prevented by the external crust. In consequence of the effort of expansion in the internal parts, the greater number of glass drops burst in cooling; and those which remain entire are not regularly crystallized. A smart stroke upon them communicates a vibration to the whole mass, which is nearly synchronous in every part; and therefore the effort of expansion has little more effect than if the body were at rest; but the small tail and the surface only are regularly crystallized. If the tail be broken, this communicates a vibration along the crystallized surface, without reaching the internal parts. By this they are allowed some expansion; and overcoming the cohesion of the thin outer shell, they burst it, and are dispersed in powder.\n",
      "In an unannealed glass vessel the same thing takes place. Sometimes the vibration may continue for a considerable time before the internal parts overcome the resistance. If the vessel be very thin, the regular crystallization extends through the whole thickness; or at least the quantity of compressed matter in the middle is so inconsiderable as to be incapable of bursting the external plate.\n",
      "By the process of annealing the glass is kept for some time in a state approaching to fluidity; the heat increases the bulk of the crystallized part, and renders it so soft,, that the internal parts have the opportunity of expanding! and forming a regular crystallization.\n",
      "In the manufactures in which the malleable metals are employed, annealing is used to soften a metal after it has been rendered hard by the hammer; and also to soften cast-iron, which is rendered very hard and brittle by r a . pid cooling.\n",
      "In the manufacture of steel goods, which are firstform. ed by the hammer, and require to be filed or otherwise treated, and in which softness and flexibility are essential to the change, annealing is absolutely necessary. This is particularly the case in making files and scissors, that the metal may be left sufficiently soft for cutting’the teeth, and for filing off those parts which cannot be ground. Annealing is not less necessary in the drawing of wire, whether iron, copper, brass, silver, or gold. The operation of drawing soon gives the wire a degree of hardness and elasticity which, if not removed from time to time by annealing, would prevent the extension of the wire, and render it extremely brittle. The same operation is also necessary in rolling or flatting those metals which are in a cold state, such as brass, silver, gold, &c. The brazier who forms vessels of copper and brass by the hammer, can work upon it only for a little time before he is obliged to anneal it. ∙\n",
      "The common methods employed for annealing iron and steel are very injudicious, and materially injure the latter when it is used for making cutting instruments. After they have been formed by the hammer, they are generally piled up in an open fire, slowly raised to red heat, and then allowed as gradually to cool. By this method the surface of the steel will be found considerably scaled, from the action of the oxygen of the atmosphere. When it is remembered that steel consists of iron joined to carbon, it will be evident that the steel immediately under the scaly oxide will be deprived of its carbon, which has been carried off by the attraction of the oxygen; and, in consequence, will lose the property of acquiring that degree of hardness necessary to a cutting instrument.\n",
      "Nothing, therefore, can be more obvious, than that steel particularly should be annealed in close vessels, to prevent that effect. For this purpose the goods should be placed in a trough or recess made of fire-stone or fire-brick, and stratified with ashes or clean sand, and finally covered with a thick stratum of the same; but if the size of the vessel be small, it may have a cover of its own materials. This oven or trough must now be heated by the flame of a furnace passing under and round it, till the whole is of a red heat. It must then be suffered to cool, without letting in the air. The goods so treated will be much softer than by the common method. The surface, instead of becoming scaled, will have acquired a metallic whiteness, from the presence of a small quantity of carbonaceous matter contained in the ashes in which they were imbedded. They will become so flexible also, as to allow them to bend considerably without breaking, which is very far from being the case before the operation. The fracture, before annealing, will be smooth and short; but afterwards it will be rough, exhibiting bright parts, of a crystalline appearance. Wire, especially that of iron and steel, should be treated in a similar way when it is annealed. Th e wire used for some purposes requires to be soft, and is sold in that state. If the wire, after finishing, when it 18 bright and clean, were to be annealed in contact with oxygen, it would not only lose all its lustre and smoothness, but much of its tenacity. The process above mentioned will therefore be particularly necessary in annealing fin 18 * 1 ' ed wire, as well as in softening it from time to time during the drawing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Copper and brass suffer much less than iron and steel from annealing in the open air, and do not require to be heated above a low red heat. If, however, the lustre is to be preserved, a close vessel would be desirable. The latter metals, after annealing, although much discoloured by the oxygen of the atmosphere, may be cleansed by immersion in a hot liquor composed of water and a small quantity of sulphuric or nitric acid. Very small brass or copper wire is frequently annealed by exposing it to the flame of hay or straw. In casting minute pieces of pig-iron, which is generally done in wet sand, the metal possesses the property of steel to such a degree as to assume, by the rapid cooling, a degree of hardness equal to hardened steel; at the same time that the articles are so brittle as to break by falling on the ground. When, however, these goods are treated in the way above directed, they acquire a degree of softness which renders them penetrable by the file, and at the same time capable of bcnding. In this state they are much less tenacious than steel, but still so much so as to have been sold in the form of cutlery for steel.\n",
      "The change which metals undergo by annealing is not yet thoroughly understood. Most of the malleable metals are susceptible of two distinct forms, one called the crystalline form, whieh they assume by slow cooling; and the other the fibrous, which is acquired by hammering or rolling. When this, however, is carried beyond a certain point, the metal becomes so hard that it is not capable of being bent far without breaking. All the malleable metals in the ingot or in their cast state are brittle, and exhibit a crystalline fracture. By hammering or rolling they become more tenacious, and break with difficulty, exhibiting what is called a fibrous fracture. At the same time they become stiffer and more elastic. They lose the latter properties by annealing, but become more malleable. If the annealing, however, be long continued, the malleability diminishes, and they again have a crystalline fracture. Zinc by wire-drawing becomes very flexible, and possesses a degree of tenacity not inferior to that of copper; but, if it be kept in boiling water for a length of time, it will resum\n",

      "a maritime county of Ireland, in the province of Ulster, situate in the northern extremity of the island. It presents a considerable line of coast to the Northern Ocean and to the Irish Channel. By the former it is bounded on the north, and by the latter on the east. Carrickfergus Bay, or Belfast Lough, and the river Lagan, on the south-east, divide it from the county of Down, as far to the south as Spencer’s Bridge. To the southwest it has the same county, which, running to a point, meets Loughneagh at Shanport. The winding shores of Loughneagh and Loughbeg form its boundaries on the west, as far as the point where it meets the river Bann; whence this river taking a northern course, inclining west, separates the counties of Antrim and Derry, until it touches the liberties of Coleraine (about 3000 acres), which are on the Antrim side of that river.\n",
      "This county lies between 54° 26'and 55° 12' north latitude. Its greatest length, from Bengove Head north to Spencer’s Bridge south, is 41 Irish miles; and its greatest breadth, from the Gobbins east to Toome west, is about 24 miles; comprising, according to the latest authorities, 420,999 Irish acres.\n",
      "In 1584-5 the county was divided into eight baronies, viz. Dunluce, Glenarm, Toome, Antrim, Belfast, Massereene, Carey, and Kilconway. Of late years all except the two last have been subdivided into half-baronies, called Upper and Lower. There are also smaller divisions, as parishes, granges, manors, constablewicks, townlands or quarterlands. The number of parishes is 72, the townlands amount to 1543. As far as the original names of the latter have been discovered, they are purely Celtic, and expressive of the qualities of the land, or of some other local circumstances. This subdivision is said to have taken place in the 13th century. Several of the granges are extra-parochial, and some of them do not pay tithes.\n",
      "The county returns four members to the imperial parliament, viz. two for the shire, and one for each of the towns of Belfast and Lisburn, both of which are close boroughs. Carrickfergus, though within the lower half-barony of Belfast, yet is a county corporate, distinct from the county of Antrim. It is a free borough, and returns one member to parliament.. .In Carrickfergus are held the assizes, elections, and sessions twice every year, for the county of Antrim. The other chief towns are, Ballymena, Ballymony, Antrim, and Larne: sessions arc held in the first three, and also in Belfast. . ?.. l .\n",
      "1 he bishopric of Connor comprehends the county'of Antrim and liberties of Coleraine, except the parish of Aghalee, in the barony of Massereene, which is in the diocese of Dromore, and the townland of Ballyscullion-beg, on the Antrim side of the river Bann, attached to that of Derry.\n",
      "The interior of the county on the eastern side is mountainous, nearly destitute of plantations, and abounding i∏ bogs, many of which, from their situation, appear irreclaimable. This character also in some measure applies to the northern side; and it is computed that at least 119,136 acres are incapable of improvement. The baronies of Belfast, Antrim, Massereene, and Toome, are the most level and fruitful. A stupendous assemblage of basaltic columns, the Giant’s Causeway, which is described under its own title, is seen on the maritime confines of Antrim; as also Fairhead, and other lofty capes and promontories. These are composed of thousands of prismatic pillars of various dimensions, ranged in successive strata, and so closely connected in some places that a cavity formed in the surface holds water. The principal mountains are. Knocklead, near Ballycastle; Aura, Trostram, Slemish;and Devis, near Belfast.\n",
      "Besides basalt, there are found limestone, gypsum, coals, surturbrand or fossil wood, freestone, and marble. The fossil wood, or wood-coal, in most places, as at Ballintoy and Killymorris, is covered with columns of basalt. In burning it emits a disagreeable smell, resembling that of rotten wood. Notwithstanding the compressed state in which it is found, the bark and knots are quite distinct, and the rings denoting the annual growth of the wood may be counted. In some instances the roots of the trees maybe traced. Their heads all lie to the east, and seem as if laid down by a storm. Of the three coal mines which are wrought in Ulster, there are two in Antrim; the one at Ballycastle, the other at Killymorris. The greater quantity of coal raised at Ballycastle is exported; at Killymorris little is raised, except in wet seasons when peat is scarce.\n",
      "The rivers of this county are numerous, but in general small. The most considerable are, the Lower Bann, which discharges the waters of Loughneagh into the sea near Coleraine; the Lagan, which falls into the Lough of Belfast; and the Maine, which rises near Ballymony, and disembogues itself into Loughneagh near Randlestown. The other rivers are the Bush, Revel, Braid, Kells-water, Six-mile-water, Crumlin, and Glencavy, none of which is navigable. Near Ballycastle and Rasharkin are chalybeate springs; and there is a salt spring near Carrickfergus. Loughneagh, belonging more properly to the county of Armagh, will be described under that article. It may be proper, however, to notice in this place, that, of the two islands in this expanse of water, Ram Island, from its contiguity to Antrim, is considered as belonging to that county. It contains about seven acres, and is the property of Lord O’Neill, who has erected on it a beautiful cottage.\n",
      "Rathlin Island lies off the northern coast of the county, opposite to the town of Ballycastle, from whose quay its nearest point is distant five miles. This island is about five miles in length, and, at.a mean, upwards of three quarters of a mile in breadth, divided into 25 quarterlands, and containing 1996 acres, about one fourth of which is arable. Barley is almost the only grain sown, and, with kelp, furnishes their chief exports. In 1802 the island contained 145 dwelling-houses, and 1021 inhabitants: in 1821 it had 1080 inhabitants.· On the northern angle of the island are some vestiges of a castle celebrated as having afforded refuge in 1306 to Robert Bruce. Near-this building is a natural cavern called Bruces Cave; at its entrance is a wall of lime and stone, which, had evidently been erected for its defence.\n",
      "No regular accounts of the climate of Antrim have been kept except at Belfast; and from these it appea ri that less rain falls here than is generally supposed, the annual fall of rain, on an average of six complete years, /being only 24∙700 inches. The greatest height of the barometer between the years 1796 and 1809 was 31 inches, the lowest 28 inches. The greatest height of the thermometer during that period was 78° ∙80, the lowest 25°. The mean temperature of the northern coast of Antrim, near the town of Ballycastle, in latitude 55° 12', as observed in the year 1788, by means of copious springs flowing from limestone soil, was 4b o .\n",
      "The estates in Antrim are in general freehold, being cither immediate grants from the crown, or held under those grants: the only exceptions are the properties held under the see of Connor. Some of the estates are very large. The marquises of Hertford and Donegall, and the Antrim family, possess the fee of the greater part of the county. The estate of the first includes 11 parishes, containing nearly 80,000 English acres. The marquis of Donegall usually lets his lands on a fine for 61 years, or three lives: of late he has also granted many perpetuities. Most of the Antrim estate is let on perpetuity, in lots worth from L.1000 to L.4000 per annum. The other chief proprietors are Lord O’Neill, the countess of Massereene, Colonel Packenham, and Lord Templeton. The estate of the last is only leasehold under the marquis of Donegall. In January 1830 the total number of registered freeholders in this county for L.10 and upwards was 2037: in the same year the anìount of the county cess was L.4l,627. 9s. lid.\n",
      "The farms in Antrim are in general small; in the arable districts they generally vary from six to thirty acres, and the average rent is estimated at between 20s. and 35s. the Irish acre. The principal feature in the tillage system of a great part of the county is the potato fallow. The quantity of potato land is commonly regulated by the manure that can be collected: of late years the culture of potatoes has been much increased by the use of lime. After potatoes, wheat or oats are sown; if the latter, two or three crops are successively taken. When the ground is exhausted, potatoes are again planted, or the land is suffered to rest for a year or two, until it is covered with natural grass, in which state it is termed lea. The sowing of wheat is chiefly confined to the baronies of Belfast, Antrim, and Massereene. In 1763 there was not one flour-mill in the county. Flax is also sown after potatoes, except in the lower or northern part of the county. It bears a very small proportion in the general crop, less being sown than formerly. Flax-seed is rarely attempted to be saved. Of late years a considerable quantity of flax has been imported, chiefly from Holland. In 1830 the quantity of flax-seed imported at Belfast was 5637 hogsheads, the greater part of whieh was sown in the counties of Down, Armagh, and Derry. Barley is also sown in many places, but seldom in large quantities. Die culture of beans is chiefly confined to the parishes of Island-Mag¢e and Cairncastle; they are mostly exported to Scotland. Turnips or vetches are rarely sown. Kail are seldom planted as food for cattle. Sueh is the principal feature of the husbandry of the county of Antrim, which, however, from the improvements made by individuals, admits of many exceptions. This is strikingly exemplified in those districts where the tenants hold leases under liberal landlords there underwoods have been cleared off, bogs or marshes reclaimed into arable lands or meadow, and better and less cumbrous fences erected\n",

      "d’, a French geographer of the highest eminence, and perhaps the most celebrated in modern times. He was born at Paris on the Hth of July 1697. His passion for geographical research displayed itself from his earliest years. At the age of 12, while reading the Latin authors at college, he amused himself with drawing maps of the countries which they described. While he was thus busily employing himself one day in the class, his master observed and was about to punish him; but upon casting his eye upon the performance, he immediately judged him to be rather deserving of encouragement. D’Anville from this time devoted himself entirely to geography, particularly that of the ancient world; and at the age of 22 he began to delineate maps which attracted the attention of the most eminent geographers.\n",
      "There are two modes by which problems in geography may be solved; one mathematically, by astronomical observation or geometrical measurement; the other historically, by the distances of places inferred from the narrative of historians and travellers. The former is certainly the most satisfactory, and would supersede every other, could it be extended over the whole surface of the globe. But, notwithstanding the splendid progress made since the era of D’Anville, it is still far from such a degree of perfection. In all countries the bulk of the positions must be filled up, and in some the whole must be constructed from mere historical materials. Perhaps there is no department of science which requires greater extent of knowledge and accuracy of judgment. The variety of sources out of which the materials must be drawn is almost infinite; and their application is equally nice and difficult. It must be regulated by a complete acquaintance with all the modes of measurement used by all nations; by a careful notice of those errors and contradictions which naturally arise from a partial and limited observation; and by the marking of certain delicate processes in the human mind, by which space and distance are sometimes diminished, and more frequently exaggerated. In the skilful geographer, sound natural judgment, enlightened by experience, creates, as it were, a new sense, which enables him to see consistency amid a labyrinth of contradictions, and to elicit truth from a multitude of statements that are all erroneous. This art may be said to have originated with D’Anville, and to have been brought by him to its highest perfection.\n",
      "The course of study on which D’Anville entered was truly immense. Works professedly geographical formed the least part of it; those of all the ancient and modern historians, travellers, narrators of every description, were assiduously examined. He studied, but only for the sake of the occasional geographical lights which they afforded, the philosophers, orators, and poets; for it was remarked that, in perusing these masterpieces of human genius, he was totally indifferent to every thing which did not tend to fix a geographical position. The object of this immense labour was to effect a complete reform in the science of geography; to banish the system of copying blindly from preceding maps, and never to fix a single position without a careful examination of all the authorities upon which it rested. By this process he detected many and great errors in the works of his most celebrated predecessors, while his own accuracy was soon attested on all sides by the travellers and mariners who had taken his works as their guide. His principles led him also to another innovation, which was that of omitting every name for which there existed no sufficient authority. The public were at first amazed at seeing vast spaces, which had before been covered with countries and cities, suddenly reduced to a perfect blank; but they soon recognised that this was the only accurate course, and that the defect lay in the science, not in the geographer.\n",
      "D’Anville was at first employed in the humbler task of illustrating by maps the works of different travellers, such as Marchais, Charlevoix, Labat, and Duhalde. The question respecting the figure of the earth coming to be much agitated, he published, in 1735 and 1736, two treatises, with a view to illustrate it. But this attempt to solve a geometrical problem by historical materials was eminently unsuccessful. Maupertuis having gone to measure a degree within the polar circle, the result λvas found directly opposite to our geographer’s prediction. This, however, was considered by the intelligent public rather as fixing limits to his mode of investigation, than as implying any want of diligence and ability in its employment.\n",
      "Any loss of reputation which this failure might occasion was completely 7 retrieved by his map of Italy, published in 1743. It was marked by a species of investigation, often employed by D’Anville with peculiar success. This consisted in the application of ancient materials to correct the existing geography. By the diligent study of the Latin authors, he was enabled to trace numerous errors which had crept into the delineation of this interesting country. A trigonometrical survey which Pope Benedict XIV. almost immediately after caused to be made in the Ecclesiastical States, confirmed, in a surprising degree, all these alterations. On this occasion he first set the example, which cannot be too much applauded, of accompanying the map with a memoir, exhibiting a view of the data on which it had been constructed.\n",
      "He now applied himself to ancient geography, always his favourite department, and the aspect of which, under his hands, was soon completely changed. He illustrated successively, by maps, all the countries known to the ancients, among which Egypt attracted his peculiar attention. To render these labours more extensively useful, he published in 1768 an Abridgement of Ancient Geography. His attention was finally turned to the middle ages, which were illustrated by his States formed in Eurορt after the Fall of the Western Empire, and by some othe works equally learned. Entirely devoted to geographica inquiries, the appearance of his successive publications formed the only events, by which his life was diversified. From causes which are not explained, he was late m being admitted into the literary societies. In 1754, at the age of 60, he became a member of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, whose Transactions he enriched with many papers. In 1775 he received the only place in the Academy of Sciences which is allotted to geography; and in the same year he was appointed, without solicitation, first geographer to the king. But these honours came too late to illustrate a life which was now drawing to its utmost verge. His last employment consisted in arranging his collection of maps, plans, and geographical materials. It was the most extensive in Europe, and had been purchased by the king, who, however, left him the use of it during his life. This task performed, he sunk into a total imbecility, both of mind and bodv, which continued for two years, and ended only with 'his death in January 1782, when he had nearly reached the great age of 85.\n",
      "D’Anville, with the qualities which form the great geographer, united all the essentials of an honourable and worthy character. The advancement of the science to which he had devoted himself formed almost the sole passion of his life; and, mingling little with society, he contracted peculiarities which solitary study is but too apt to engender. He talked with little interest on any subject except geography. This topic necessarily led to that of his own discoveries, on which he was never weary of expatiating. He boasted without any reserve of the services whieh he had rendered to that science, using not unsrequently the expression of Augustus, “I found it of brick, and left it of marble.” He, however, did full justice to the merit of those who excelled in other branches of knowledge; and to such as furnished him with materials for his researches, his gratitude was unbounded.\n",

      "Under the article Bee, in this work, directions will be given at considerable length as to the management of an apiary, and various methods detailed of procuring honey and wax from the hive without destroying the bees themselves. The most economic mode of attaining these ends deserves more attention as a national object than it has in general received in this country. It appears, from the returns of the custom-líouse, that England pays annually to the north of Germany from L.40,000 to L.50,000 sterling for the wax and honey which are imported from thence, and which might very easily be raised by a more extended and judicious cultivation of bees at home. Greater attention to this useful appendage to the cottage would not only be productive of commercial advantage, but would tend to improve the condition of the lower order of peasantry. It is not generally known, indeed, what profitable returns may be obtained, at a trifling expense of time and labour, by very simple processes. Mr Huish, the author of a valuable practical treatise on the management of bees, has made a calculation, from which he infers, that even supposing the first cost of a swarm to be one guinea, which is the price in the places where they are sold the dearest, the cottager is almost certain, by proper care and management, of clearing, in five years, a net produce of nearly L.60, and of having besides, at the end of that period, ten good stocks of bees in lιife garden.\n",
      "The principal objects to be attained in the construction and management of an apiary, are to secure the prosperity and multiplication of the colonies; to increase the amount of theii∙ productive labour; and to obtain their products with facility, and with the least possible detriment to the stock. Tlιe apiary should afford to the bees the best shelter against moisture and the extremes of heat and of cold, and especially against sudden vicissitudes of temperature; it should protect them against their numerous enemies; it' should afford them every facility of constructing their combs, and of rearing their young; it should allow of every part of the combs being occasionally inspected, and being capable of removal when requisite; and, while due attention is paid to economy, it should be made óf materials that will insure its durability. Much ingenuity has been displayed by different apiarians in the construction of hives which should unite in the greatest possible degree all these advantages. Although it be in vain to hope that every one of these objects can at once be perfectly attained, yet there is still great room for improvement on the hives that are at present in common use; and we shall here point out a few of the more reCėnt modes of construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some cultivators of bees have been chiefly anxĩ- 'ous to promote their multiplication, and to prevent the escape of the swarms in tlιe natural way, by procuring what they have termed artificial swarms, —which they effected by separating a populous hive, previous to its swarming, into two parts, and allowing to each greater room for the extension of their works; others have contemplated only the abundance of the products which they yielded, and the facility of extracting them from the hive, without showing any particular solicitude as to the preservation of the bees themselves. Another class of apiarians have, on the other hand, had it more particularly in view to facilitate the prosecution of researches in the natural history and economy of bees. The hive invented by Mr Huber is peculiarly calculated for the last of these objects, and its construction is founded on an accurate knowledge of the habits of these insects. He has given it the name of niche en livre ou en feuillets, from its opening and shutting somewhat in the manner of the leaves of a book. This booh or leaf hive is composed of from eight to twelve square wooden frames, placed vertically, and joined together sidewise like the hoops of a cask. Each frame consists of two uprights, one inch in thickness, a foot in height, and an inch and a third in width, connected by an upper and lower cross bar, ten inches long, and of the same breadth and thickness as the former; so that all the frames may be joined together, without leaving any interval. The two external frames are closed each by a pane of glass, which is covered by a shutter on the outside; and the whole is properly .secured in its place, and further protected by an external cover. An aperture must of course be left in the lower part of one of the frames to serve as a door. In order to determine the bees to construct their combs in the plane of each leaf, a small piece of honeycomb is fixed, by means of pegs, to the top of each in the proper position, as it is well known that bees always complete their work in the direction in which they find it begun, unless they meet with some insurmountable obstacle. 4 proper distance is thus preserved between the lateral surfaces of the perpendicular combs; and the external ones, being only three or four lines distant from the glass panes, may be easily inspected by opening the shutters; and also by opening in succession the different divisions of the hive, both surfaces of every comb may at pleasure be fully brought into view. No difficulty is experienced in introducing swarms into hives of this construction; and after the lapse of a few days, when the’ colony is fully established, the bees will very patiently submit to be daily inspected.\n",
      "Mr Huber’s hive is exceedingly well calculated for producing artificial swarms on the principle of Schirach’s discovery, of which a full account will be given in the article Bee. It allows us to judge by inspection whether the population is sufficient to admit of division,—if the brood is of the proper age,—and if males exist, or are ready to be produced, for impregnating the young queen; all which circumstances are of material consequence to the success of the operation. It is essential that some of the larvae should not have been hatched above three days before this attempt is made. The frames must then be gently separated at the middle of the hive, and two empty frames be introduced in the interval between the former; each of these new frames having a partition which closes them completely, so as to enable the two portions to be entirely separated without leaving any opening. The door of that portion in which the queen happens to be. at .this time may remain open, but the one belonging to the other part must be closed, so as to retain the bees that have no queen prisoners for 24 hours, allowing still, however, sufficient circulation of air. After this interval of time they appear to have forgotten their queen, at least they are no longer anxious to seek for her, but bestow all their solicitude in the education of the larvae, so as to convert a certain number of them into queens to supply the loss they have sustained. This they accomplish in ten days or a fortnight after the operation. The two colonies are now perfectly distinct, and are never found afterwards to intermix.\n",
      "Another advantage attending a hive of this construction consists in its enabling us to force the bees to produce a much greater quantity of wax than they would naturally do. The interval which separates the combs when the bees have not been disturbed in their operations is constantly the same, namely, about four lines. Were they too distant, it is evident that the bees would be much dispersed, and finable to communicate their heat reciprocally, and the brood would not be. preserved in a sufficient degree of warmth. Were the combs too close, on the contrary, the bees could not freely traverse the intervals, and the work of the hive would suffer. It is evident that we may avail ourselves of this instinct, and, by separating farther asunder the combs that are already built, induce the bees either to extend the breadth of those they had begun, or to build others in the interval, if sufficient space be allowed them for this purpose. Thus, by interposing three empty frames, one between every alternate interval of the combs in a hive containing six combs, three additional combs, if the proper season be chosen, will be obtained at the end of a week; and if the weather continue favourable, the operation may be repeated, and the same number of additional combs procured the week after.\n",
      "The principal obstacles to the general employment of Mr Huber’s hives are the expense of constructing them, and the greater degree of attention which they perhaps require from the cultivator. It has also been objected that the flatness of the roof was prejudicial, by allowing the πjoisture which exhales from the bees to collect at the top, and to fall in drops at different parts, to the great injury of the subjacent contents of the hive. Feburier proposes therefore the employment of frames in the form of a trapezium, so that the roof shall be considerably inclined to the horizon. He borrows this shape from Bose, whose hive consists, however, only of two boxes joined together sidewise, and separable in order to form artificial swarms. This was.an improvement upon Gelieu’s hive, which was formed of two square boxes united laterally. Delator had recommended a still more simple form than that of Bose, though less convenient; namely, that of a triangle resting on its base. Mr Ravenel’s hive consists of three square boxes instead of two; Mr Scrain’s is also made up of three boxes, but they are low and of great length, and are joined endwise,—a communication being established between them by apertures made in the divisions which separate the boxes. It is now, however, well established, that partitions of any kind are detrimental to the prosperity of the colony. The same objection applies, though perhaps.in an inferior degree, to the system of storied hives, or those which are divided into stories one above another. A great variety of the latter description, however, have been recommended by different \n",

      "so called from its near resemblance to water-colour drawings, is of modern invention, and was much practised about 12 or 15 years ago, since which period it has not been so much in fashion.\n",
      "It is performed in a variety of ways; but the most approved is by covering or immersing the copper-plate in a solution of resinous matter, rendered so in rectified spirits of wine, and by working or drawing the object which is wished to be represented, upon the plate, with a prepared pigment, commonly called the bursting ground. These solutions and grounds are made of a variety of substances, described in recipes at the end of this article.\n",
      "The work is generally commenced by etching, or tracing the outline upon the plate with an etching needle or other sharp instrument, which being done, and the etching ground removed, the plate must be made particularly clean and free from grease, with whitening and water. The plate is then to be placed in a flat tin or earthen vessel, in an inclined position, and the resinous solution or ground (No. 1, &c.) poured quickly upon it from the top to the bottom, so that the superfluous ground may run off, and be preserved for after-use in a vessel so placed as to receive it. Should the subject to be engraved be a landscape, it will be advisable to allow the ground upon the plate to dry in the inclined position, because the granulation of the shade or tint has a tendency to be closer and finer in proportion as it is nearer the top of the plate; and in this way the sky is represented by the finest grain at the top, and the foreground by the coarsest at the bottom of the plate. Should the subject require an equality of tint or grain, it will be procured by reversing the inclined position of the plate backwards and forwards as quickly as possible after the ground has been poured on it. The spirit of wine will very speedily evaporate, leaving the plate dry, with the ground upon it ready for work; but in order to render it more secure, it may be held over a clear fire, with the back of the plate next the coals until the resin of the ground is a little heated, and so fixed to the plate more completely. Care must, however, be taken, in this operation, not to melt the resinous granulations so much as to cause them to unite into solid masses.\n",
      "The design is now to be drawn upon the plate with the bursting ground (No. 10, &c.), exactly in the same manner as any water-colour drawing is set about: every part where a tint is required is to be covered over with the bursting ground, and the lights alone left untouched with it. When this composition is quite dry, take a broad camel»\n",

The plate is now to be surrounded with a border of wax (14), so as to retain the aqua fortis. When the varnish is dry, as much clean water must bc poured upon the copper as can be contained within the border wax, and in about 15 minutes the bursting ground will burst open the varnish, and leave the aquatinta ground ready for being bit in with the diluted acid. The bursting away of the bursting ground may be aided with the help of a clean camel-hair pencil or goose-qui∏ feather; but if the composition bc properly made this will not be necessary. The plate may now be said to be ready for the first tint being bit in with the aqua fortis, which must be allowed to remain upon it until the shade is seen to be of a proper colour, when the acid must be poured off, and the plate cleaned with water, to prepare it for the second tint; which is to be accomplished in the same manner as described for the first; and thus the greatest softness of shade, and the utmost sharpness of touch in the foreground or sky, may be attained. A pair of bellows may be used to dry the plate more quickly between the bitings with the aqua fortis, and so prevent the copper from becoming corroded by the water. From the description above given, it will be obvious that in some cases the bursting ground will not be required, and that the lights alone will need to bc stopped out with the varnish ;—such as in fleecy white clouds, the high lights upon metallic substances, &c.; all which practice will soon suggest to the artist.\n",
      "Before we proceed to describe some other modes of performing this operation, we may remark, that when very fine grounds are required, it is customary only to bite in the lightest shades with the first granulation, and then to clean the plate and lay on a second, or even a third and fourth ground, at various stages of the work. But it must be held in mind, that in proportion as. the grounds are multiplied, the granulations are subdivided, and their rich grain lost; while at the same time the work is rendered less serviceable, by its casting off a smaller number of impressions.\n",
      "Should the bursting ground not flow on the plate freely, out of the camel-hair pencil, in consequence of the plate being greasy, it may be washed with very weak aqua fortis before commencing. If the weather should be very cold, it is difficult to obtain a good ground; on which account it will be advisable to heat the apartment with a stove to a moderate summer heat.\n",
      "Dust Grounds are prepared by covering the plate with powders of various mixtures, and fixing them by holding it over a clear fire; and the operation o: biting in the subject with the aqua fortis, and the painting of the objects upon the plate, may be performed in the manner above described, and either with or without the bursting grounds. The powders may be applied to the surface of the copper in a variety of ways. As good a mode as any is to cover over the top of a small box with one or two layers of muslin, and dust the powder through these layers of muslin equally upon it. For this purpose the plate will require to be a little greasy, that the powder may adhere the more readily; and when the whole surface is covered, give the plate a sharp stroke upon the back, that the superfluous particles may be disengaged.\n",
      "Madame Prestel’s ground, celebrated for its fineness, is produced in the following manner: The plate is placed with its face upwards in a box, about six inches deep, covered with a lid: at one end introduce through a ein ular hole the small end of a hair-dresser’s powder machine, filled with finely pulverized resin, and work it till the plate is completely covered with the powder, which fix over a clear fire, as already described.\n",

The Arachnides were first formed into a distinct class by Μ. Lamarck, whose arrangement of the Linnaean Aptera is admitted by Latreille to approach the most nearly to the natural order.\n",
      "The third primary division in the system of Cuvier, that of the articulated animals (animalia articulata), contains four great classes, viz. Annelides, Crustacea, Arachnides, and Insecta. We have already stated our intention (see Animal Kingdom) to treat of the first of these classes under the title of Helminthology, of the last under Entomology, and of the two intermediate classes in the order of their alphabetical occurrence. We shall I therefore now proceed with the history and classification of Arachnides.\n",
      "The naturalists who preceded Lamarck appear to have confounded this class either with the true Insecta, or with the crustaceous tribes, such as crabs and lobsters. It was in the course of his public lectures (in 1800) that the last-named, observer instituted for their reception a separate class, under the title which they now bear.\n",
      "Cuvier, in one of his earliest works (Tableau Elémentaire de l'Hist. Nat. des Animaux, 1798), continued, with his contemporaries, to class the Arachnides with insects, of which he regarded them as forming the third principal division, preceded only by the Crustacea and Myriapoda; thus far departing from and improving the old Linnaean system, by assigning them a higher place in his general arrangement, but not yet admitting them to the honour of a separate class.\n",
      "Lamarck published the first edition of his Systeme des Animaux sans Vertèbres in the year 1801, and he there explains the reasons which induced him to form the separation previously advocated in his lectures.\n",
      "Μ. Latreille did not admit the classic separation of the Arachnides, either in his Histoire Naturelle de Crustacés et des Insectes (1802-5), or in his later work, the Genera Cηιstaceorum et Insectorum (1806-7), but merely placed them at the head of the class of insects. In a subsequent volume, however (Considérations Generales sur ľ Ordre Naturel des Crustacés, &c. 1810), he practically admits the propriety of Μ. Lamarck’s views; and in it we find the Arachnides forming a separate class, and constituted of the same materials as those used by his predecessor. In that portion of Baron Cuvier’s Regne Animal (vol. iii. 1817) of which Μ. Latreille is the author, we find the same arrangement followed, with this exception, that in the last-named work the Myτiapoda and Chelopoda are removed from the Arachnides and placed at the head of the class Insecta—a modification likewise adhered to both in the Familles Naturelles du Règne Animal (1825), and in the recent edition of the Règne Animal itself ( 1829), which contains the latest view of Μ. Latreille. By these, in as far as concerns our general principles of arrangement, 've shall be chiefly guided in the course of this article; but we conceive it due to Μ. Lamarck to present our readers, in the first place, with a short statement of his opinions.^[1. See the Histoire Naturelle des Animaux tans Vertèbres, ’ i vols. 8vo∙ Paris, 1815—22. ]\n",
      "He defines the Arachnides as follows: Oviparous animals, at all times provided with articulated legs,—not subject to metamorphoses, nor ever acquiring new kinds of organs. Respiration tracheal or branchial: stigmatiform openings for the entrance of the air. A rudimentary heart and circulation in the greater proportion of species. Copulationes plures per vitam in plurimis.^[2. “Animalia ovipara, pedibus articulatis in omni tempore instructa, ad metamorphoses non subjecta, nec nova partium genera acquirentia. Respiratio trachealis aut branchialis; orificiis pro aeris intromissione stigmatiformibus. Cor circulatioque in pluribus inchoatis. Copulationes,” &c. ut supra. ]\n",
      "It is known that no vertebrated animal provided with feet has ever more than four; and that among such as are invertebrated, those which in a state of complete development are provided with feet, have never less than six. Amongst invertebrated animals, insects have essentially the smallest number of feet; for the various orders and families of that class, when arrived at their final development, have never more than six. They are hence called hexapods by some modern writers. It is otherwise, however, with the Crustacea and Arachnides, the greater proportion of which have more than six feet. Certain species, in their earliest state, have no more than that number; but their other feet appear as they advance in age. A few are hexapod, or six-footed, during the entire term of their existence; but in addition to those characters whieh determine the class to which they belong, various other relations connect them with their congeners, and show that they are not genuine insects.\n",
      "Among those articulated animals which possess no system of circulation, insects alone undergo genuine metamorphoses; and none of the Arachnides are subject to such changes. Now, as all Arachnides are essentially distinct from the Crustacea, and as they differ from insects in the important characteristic just mentioned, it follows, according to Μ. Lamarck, that they constitute an assemblage of beings which ought not to be held in separation, however diversified they may be in various points of their organization.\n",
      "The most remarkable circumstances in the structure of Arachnides are the following: That while many of these creatures are obviously provided with a circulating system, others present no vestige of that system; that the former breathe by means of branchial cells, while the latter respire through tracheae; and that certain tribes are provided with antennae, and others are entirely destitute of any such organs. These apparent non-conformities of structure result from this, that throughout the extended course of their class, the organization of the Arachnides undergoes rapid and remarkable changes; and if in the course of our observations we were to attend not only to the differences of external or internal parts, but to the progress of nature in the order of her productions, we would sooner perceive the propriety of that succession or change of organization even among animals really allied to each other by the great majority of their relations; and it would not have been deemed necessary to remove to another class such of the Arachnides as were antennated, because it would have been then more clearly perceived how incompatible was such a change with the assignment of their natural and appropriate place in the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The class of Arachnides, as established by Lamarck in his Cours, contained five or six small families, which, though each possessed of particular characters of distinction, it would have been difficult to separate from their common frame-work, without considerable inconvenience to whatever other class one or more of such families might have been removed. If, for example, the antennated Arachnides should be classed among insects, we then destroy the most simple and satisfactory definition which can be given of the last-named class, while we are forced to assign to the animals with which we unite them a position in the general series unsuitable to their real nature and attributes. If we transport the tracheal Arachnides to the class Insccta, in order to enable us to define the latter class by the exclusive character of respiring by tracheae, then insects can no longer be said to be uniformly distinguished by the possession of antennae, and the genus Phalangium, &c. would be separated from the class which contains the spiders. For these reasons Lamarck is of opinion that the division which contains his Arachnides, whether antennated or non-antennated, ought to be preserved in its integrity, if we wish to avoid the impropriety of associating with insects other forms of animal life which nature has distinguished by different characters.^[3. Animaux sans Vertèbres, tome v∙ p. 6. ]\n",
      "A class may be constituted of natural materials, and contained within suitable limits, and nevertheless present among its various families animals of very different forms and construction. During every period of its existence, a butterfly presents an aspect very dissimilar to that of a scarabaeus, yet both belong to the true Insccta. When strong general affinities {analogies d’ensemble) prevail, those special diversities of structure which are occasionally observable are insufficient to authorize a separation of classes. The genera Aranea, Phalangium, and Galeodes, are very nearly related to each other, although the first respire by obvious branchial cells, while the others enjoy a tracheal respiration.\n",
      "The non-antennated Arachnides arc in general provided with eight feet; and the Acarides and Pycnogonides conduct· naturally to the Phalangides, such as the genus phalangium and others. Now, if these Acarides belong essentially to the Arachnides, can the parasitical genera, such as Pediculus and Ricirtus, which lead towards them so evidently, be regarded as belonging to another class? The transition is so gradual and prepared, that the Acarides, provided for the most part with eight feet, like the other non-antennated Arachnides, yet present us with many genera (such as Astoma, Leptis, Caris) which have never more than six. Lamarck maintains the necessity of preserving the class Arachnides according to the limits which he has himself assigned to it, because its being so preserved relieves the class of insects from species with which that class has little or no connection. Without citing the impossibility of assigning a suitable position among insects to tribes like the Parasites, the Thysanoura, and the Myriapoda, the strongest objection to the reunion of these animals with insects is, that it will alter th\n",

      "a measure of the comparative density and rarity of bodies. The name does not occur in ancient authors; hydroscopium and baryllium being the ancient names of the instrument. This instrument was known in the civilized part of the Roman empire about the year 400, as appears from the fifteenth epistle of Synesius, addressed to Hypatia, daughter of Theon; and to Hypatia some modern writers have erroneously ascribed its invention. The instrument is also described in some verses annexed to Priscian; and the principles on which its operation is founded are to be seen in the treatise of Archimedes on floating bodies (De Hurnido Insidentibus). The term, as used by writers on natural philosophy, is chiefly applied to instruments which are made to float, so as to indicate the specific gravity of the liquids in which they are placed: the pese liqueur and hydrometer, in common use for measuring the specific gravity of vinous spirits, are instruments of this kind.\n",
      "A floating body displaces a portion of the liquid, the weight of which is equal to its own weight: the liquid acting upwards with a force equal to this weight, and the weight of the body acting downwards with the same force, equilibrium takes place. If the body be afterwards placed in a liquid of less density, the part of the body immersed will be greater than when the body was in the more dense liquid, because it requires a greater volume of this less dense liquid to equal the weight of the floating body. The absolute weights of two bodies being the same, their specific gravities are in the inverse ratio of their volumes — = ^ r , when G is put for the specific g V gravity of the first body, g for that of the second; V for the volume of the first, and ν for the volume of the second. On this principle the common hydrometer is constructed;, the instrument described by Synesius is also of this kinđ.t In order that a small difference in the volume immersed≈ may be sensible, the part which is intersected by the surface of the fluid is in the form of a very slender cylinder, the great bulk of the instrument being always immersed in the liquid. At the inferior part is a small ball, containing mercury or small lead shot, which serves as ballast, bringing the centre of gravity low, so that the instrument may float erect, and without much lateral oscillation. The common hydrometers are made of glass, and sometimes of brass, or tin or pewter, and some have been made of amber as objects of curiosity. W τ hen made of glass, a scale, inscribed upon paper, is inserted ι∏ the cylindrical stalk: the division of the scale at whae the surface of any liquid intersects the stalk, denotes the specific gravity of that liquid. The divisions of the sea e should be formed by immersing the instrument in liquids of known specific gravity, and marking a number corresponding to that specific gravity opposite to each division· The specific gravities of water and alcohol mixed m ' 3 \" rious proportions have been accurately ascertained byι' i I Gilpin· (See his Tables, and Dr Blagden’s paper in the Philosophical Transactions.) On immersing the instrument in a mixture of known proportions of these two liquids, the point at which the surface intersects the stalk is to be marked with the number expressing the specific gravity of the mixture taken from the table. Some hydrometers, such as that constructed by the French chemist Éeaumé, and which is much used in France under the name of Aréomètre de JBeaume, have the scale divided into equal parts, so that the divisions do not correspond as they ought to do with the numbers which express specific gravities. . .\n",
      "In the araeometer of Fahrenheit, the uncertainty arising from the erroneous division of the scale is obviated, no division being required. The form of the instrument is the same as that just described, only at the top there is a small cup, into which weights are put, so as to bring the surface of the denser liquid to a fixed mark on the stalk: when the instrument is placed in a liquid of less density, some of the weights are taken out till the mark again comes to the surface. Suppose the weight of the instrument and of the weights in the cup together equal to 1000, when sunk to the mark in distilled water at a certain temperature; the instrument is now taken out of the water and immersed in a liquid, where 10 must be taken out of the cup in order to bring the mark to the surface; the immersion in water indicates that a volume of water weighs 1000; the immersion in the second liquid shows that an equal volume of this liquid weighs 990; when the volumes of bodies are equal, the specific gravities are directly as the absolute weights GW . .\n",
      "— = —, consequently the specific gravity of the second liquid is 990, that of water being 1000. To save computation, it is convenient· that the whole weight of the apparatus, when in distilled water at a certain temperature, should be represented by 1000; for this purpose the instrument-maker divides the weight of the apparatus into l00u parts, and forms small weights consisting of one, two, three, &c. of these 1000th parts, the relation of which to the ounce or pound does not require to be known; the weights thus formed are to be used with the instrument.\n",
      "The araeometer of Nicholson is like that of Fahrenheit, with the addition of an immersed cup, whereby it is rendered proper for ascertaining the specific gravity of solids. Suppose that it requires 400 grains m the exterior cup to sink the instrument to the mark in distilled water, at 60 degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer; hi, The body under examination is put into the exterior cup, and weights (say grains) are taken out till the mark again stands at the surface; this gives the absolute weight of the body 300 grains. 2dly, The body is then put into the immersed cup S, taking carc to brush off any air-bubbles with a hair pencil, and in order to bring the mark to the surface, a weight (say 100 grains) must be put into the exterior cup, that is, the. weight of a volume of water equal to the body is 100 granu. Ιhe first part of the process gave the absolute weight of the b∩dy 300 grams; and the volumes being equal, the specific gravities are as the absolute weights; conse quently the specific gravity of the body is 300, that of water emg 100. This araeometer may be used to find the specific gravity of liquids: the process, in that case, is the same as that described above in speaking of the araeometer of Fahrenheit. The araeometer of Nicholson is useful to the mineralogist for ascertaining the specific gravity of minerals, the specific gravity being a convenient character for distinguishing one kind of mineral from another. It is sometimes made of tinned iron, but where more accuracy is required, copper is the material employed. When put together, it does not exceed a foot in length, and therefore is suited to form a part of the travelling mineralogist’s apparatus.\n",
      "Some araeometers have been constructed with the exterior cup C placed underneath, and supported by a stirrup, whose upper part is fixed to the stalk of the araeometer, as represented on the margin. This is done in order to place the centre of gιavity low, that the araeometer may thereby float more steadily. The araeometer floats in a cylindrical vessel fitted to the size of the stirrup, and this vessel is supported on a stand so formed as not to interfere with the free motion of the stirrup.\n",
      "The araeometer ofDeparcieux is like the common hydrometer, only the ball is much more voluminous. This renders it capable of indicating the small difference which exists in the specific gravity of the water of different springs, for which purpose Deparcieux proposed it. The dilatation of the large glass bulb by heat has a considerable effect on the operation of this instrument, and this dilatation being different in different instruments, renders the results inaccurate. The different araeometers above mentioned have the advantages of being easily made and easily carried about; but where the specific gravity of a body is required with the greatest accuracy recourse must be had to the hydrostatic balance, which ought to be constructed with the utmost care by the most skilful artist.\n",
      "The following algebraic expressions may serve to elucidate some of the properties of the araeometers hitherto spoken of:\n",
      "g is the specific gravity of water, whi ch is 1000 ounces when the ounce and foot are taken as unities, 1000 ounces avoirdupois being the weight of a cubic foot of water.\n",
      "z is the diameter of the wire-stalk of the araeometer.\n",
      "<κ is 3∙14<15, &c. the number expressing the periphery of a circle whose diameter is 1.\n",
      "⅜πz 2 is the surface of a transverse section of the wirestalk.\n",
      "v is the volume of the bulb or body of the araeometer. w is the whole weight of the araeometer.\n",
      "x is the length of the stalk that is plunged in the water.\n",
      "’ rws 2 is the volume of the immersed portion of the stalk.\n",
      "When the araeometer floats in equilibrio, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own weight; therefore, ∕ . i θ ∖ 1 w ⅛( w — <l ν ) w — gυ is the difference between the quantity of water displaced by the whole araeometer, and the quantity displaced by the bulb alone; w — gv, therefore, is the volume of water displaced by the immersed portion of the stalk. As the diameter of the stalk z is very small, the cylinder of water w — gv, which has z for its diameter, is likewise very small, and does not exceed a few grains in weight; therefore a small variation in w (the weight of the araeometer), or in g (the density of the liquid), occasions a great variation in x (the length of the immersed part of the stalk). The value of x changes rapidly, when z (the diameter of the stalk) is changed.\n",

      "one of the greatest poets of Italy, was born at Reggio in Lombardy, on the 8th day of September 1474. His father was Niccolò Ariosto, commander of the citadel of Reggio, and his mother Daria Malaguzzi of that city, where the family still exists. He showed a strong inclination to poetry from his earliest years, but was obliged by his father to study the law—a pursuit in which he lost five of the best years of his life. Having obtained liberty to follow his inclination, he applied himself to literature; and he intended to peruse the classics under Gregorio da Spoleti. But after having had the benefit of this learned man’s instructions for a short time, during which he read the best Latin authors, he was deprived of it, Gregorio having gone to France as tutor of Prince Sforza; and he thus lost the opportunity of learning Greek, as he intended. His father dying soon after, he was compelled to forego his literary occupations to undertake the management of the family, whose affairs were embarrassed, and to provide for the subsistence and education of his nine brothers and sisters, one of whom was a cripple. He, however, wrote some comedies in prose, and some lyrical pieces, about this time; and was then appointed one of the gentlemen of the cardinal Ippolito of Este. This prince usurped the character of a patron of literature, whilst the only reward which the poet received for having dedicated to him the Orlando Purioso, was the question, Where did you find so many stories, Master Ludovic? The poet himself tells us that the cardinal was ungrateful; deplores the time which he spent under his yoke; and adds, that if he received some miserable pension, it was not to reward him for his poetry, which that prelate despised, but to make some just compensation for the poet’s running like a messenger, with risk of life, at his eminence’s pleasure. Nor was even this miserable pittance regularly paid during the period that the poet enjoyed it. The cardinal went to Hungary in 1518, and wished Ariosto to accompany him. The poet excused himself, pleading ill health, his love of study, the care of his private affairs, and the age of his mother, whom it would have been disgraceful to leave. His excuses were not received, and even an interview denied to him. Ariosto then boldly said, that if his eminence thought to have bought a slave by assigning him the scanty pension of seventy-five crowns a year, he was mistaken, and that he might withdraw his boon, which it seems that prelate did·\n",
      "\n",
      "Alfonso, duke of Ferrara, then received Ariosto among his courtiers, which was an act of pure justice, that poet having distinguished himself as a diplomatist, chiefly on being sent twice to Rome as ambassador to the Pope Giulio II. The fatigue of one of these hurried journeys brought upon him a complaint from which he never recovered; and on his second mission he was nearly killed by orders of that violent pope, at that time much enraged against the duke of Ferrara. On account of the war, his salary of only 84 crowns a year was suspended, and withdrawn altogether after the peace; in consequence of which Ariosto asked the duke either to provide for him, or to allow him to go to seek employment elsewhere. A province belonging to that sovereign, situated on the wildest heights of the Apennines, being then without a governor, Ariosto was sent thither in that character, and remained there for three years. This was not a sinecure. The province was distracted by factions and banditti, the governor had not the requisite means to enforce his authority, and the duke did not support his minister as he ought. Yet it is Said that Ariosto’s government satisfied both his sovereign and the people confided to his care; and a story is added of his having fallen in, when walking out alone, with a party of banditti, whose chief apologized to the governor for not having immediately shown to him that respect which his rank required.\n",
      "Although he was dissatisfied with his office, he would not accept an embassy to Pope Clement VIL, which the secretary of the duke offered him; and spent the remainder of his life at Ferrara, writing comedies, superintending their performance, as well as the construction of a theatre, and correcting his Orlando Furioso, of which the complete edition was published only in 1532. He died of a consumption on the 6th of June 1533.\n",
      "That he was honoured and respected by the first men of his age is a fact; that most of the princes of Italy showed him great partiality is equally true; but they limited their patronage to kind words. It is not known that he ever received any substantial mark of their love for literature: hc lived and died poor. He proudly wrote, on the entrance of a house built by himself,\n",

      "which serves to show the incorrectness of the assertion of flatterers, followed by Tiraboschi, that the duke of Ferrara built that house for him. The only one who scems to have given any thing to Ariosto as a reward for his poetical talent is the marquess del Vasto, who assigned him an annuity of one hundred crowns on the revenues of Casteleone in Lombardy; but it was only paid, if ever, from the end of 1531. That he was crowned as poet by Charles V. seems untrue, although a diploma may have been issued to that effect by the emperor.\n",

      "His satires, in which we see him before us such as he was, show that there was no flattery in this portrait, from these compositions (the interest of which is only equalled by the elegance as well as naïveté of the poetry, and the shrewdness of observation of human nature which the poet displays), we are highly pleased with a noble sentiment of independence displayed by Ariosto. He seems to have been very fond, and even jealous, of his ιberty. ∩ e waś, moreover, of a changeable disposition, which he very frankly confesses in his Latin verses, as well as in the satires.\n",

      "Hence he never would bind himself, either by going into orders or marrying, till towards the end of his life, when he married Alessandra, widow of Tito Strozzi. He had no issue by her, although he left two natural sons by different mothers.\n",
      "His Latin poems do not perhaps deserve to be noticed, because, in the age of Flaminio, Vida, Fracastoro, and San-nazzaro, and from a poet like Ariosto, we have a right to expect better things. FIis lyrical compositions show a poet, although they do not secm worthy of Ariosto. His comedies, of which he wrote four, besides one which he left unfinished, arc avowedly imitated from Plautus and Terentius; and although natives may admire in them the elegance of the diction, the liveliness of the dialogue, and the novelty of some scenes, few will feel interest either in the subject or in the characters, and none will approve the immoral passages with which they are disfigured—a fault more to be reproached to the audience and the patrons of theatrical representations in those days than to the poet.\n",
      "Of all the works of Ariosto, however, the most sol d and best known monument of his fame is his poem the Orlando Furioso, the extraordinary merits of which have cast into oblivion the numberless romance poems which inundated Italy during the 15th, !6th, and 17th centuries.\n",
      "The popularity which a poem, now shamefully neglected, the Orlando Innamorato, by Bojardo, enjoyed in Ariosto’s time, cannot be well conceived, now that the enthusiasm of the Crusades, and the interest which was attached to a war against the Moslems, are no longer felt. Bojardo wrote and read his poem at the court of Ferrara, but died before he was able to finish it. Many poets undertook the difficult task of completing that magnificent work; but it was reserved to Ariosto both to finish and to surpass his original. Bojardo did not perhaps yield to Ariosto either in vigour or in richness of imagination, but he lived in a less refined age, and died before he was able to put a finishing hand to that part of the poem which he had written yielding to the impulse of his exuberant fancy; but Ariosto united to a powerful imagination a refined taste and an elegant mind. He began to write his poem about 1503; and after having consulted the first men of the age of Leo X., hc published it in 1516, in only 40 cantos; and up to the moment of his death never ceased to correct and improve both the subject and the style. It is in this latter quality that he excels, and for which Italians gave him the name of Divino Lodovico. When jesting he never forgets that he was a gentleman; when attempting pathetic descriptions or narratives, he searches the reader’s deepest feelings. In his machinery he displays a vivacity of fancy with which no other poet can vie; but he never lets his fancy carry him so far as to omit to employ, with an art peculiar to him, those simple and natural pencil-strokes with which he gives to the most extraordinary feats a colour of reality which conciliates our reason without undeceiving our bewildered imagination. The death of Zerbino, the complaints of Isabella, the effects of discord among the Saracens, the flight of Astolfo to the moon, the passion which causes Orlando’s madness, teem with beauties of every species. It is to be observed that the supposition that the poem of Ariosto is not connected throughout is utterly unfounded; there is a connection which, with a little attention, will become evident. The love of Ruggero and Brada-mante forms the main subject of the Eurioso ; and every part\n",

      ",ARREOYS. Among the more singular secret societies which mankind have formed, is one in Otaheite and the neighbouring islands for the destruction of their own species, called^Arreoy, Aτehοe, or Earοwie ; and it is not a little remarkable that it should subsist among tribes distinguished for courteousness and humanity. Wc read in the older authors that there is an absolute prohibition against the females of Formosa rearing children before the age of thirty-six, though it does not appear that there is any limitation as to the age at which their espousals may take place. But in the event of pregnancy, it is necessary that abortion should follow, which is accomplished by the aid of the priestesses of the island. Among the Arreoys, however, extirpation of the infant being constitutes the leading feature of their ordinances.\n",
      "Whether Mendana, Quiros, and the earlier navigators of the South Pacific Ocean, discovered this society, does not appear: it has, at any rate, been reserved for those of later date to unfold its principles and peculiarities, though, indeed, its constitution is still enveloped in much mystery, the members being bound to the strictest secrecy.\n",
      "The society of Arreoys consists of hundreds or perhaps thousands of both sexes, who engage to destroy their own offspring at the moment of birth. It is chiefly composed of persons distinguished by valour and merit, and hence one or more individuals of each family of the chiefs are of the number. It has been remarked, that all the men profess themselves warriors, and are in general stout and well made; that the greatest trust and confidence are reposed in them; and it rather appears that the women consist of the higher ranks only. There are different gradations in this community, which are to be recognised from the mode of tattooing: the more profusely the men are tattooed, the higher is their rank in society; the first are called Ava bly αreema tutοwe ; 2, Areernα bly; 3, Ahοwhοa ; 4, Harrotxa; 5, Eote οle ; 6, 7, Po ; and youths training up are designed Mο ; but the meaning of these names is not explained. By the fundamental laws of the society, the offspring must be destroyed, yet it is not known with certainty by whom or in what particular manner; the murder is always perpetrated in secret, probably by strangulation; all the attendants are excluded; for it is said, were they to witness it they would be adjudged guilty of participation, and put to death. Sometimes the mother, animated by natural affection, tries to preserve her infant, and resists the persuasions of her husband and his brother Arreoys, who wish to consign it to destruction. But in general ţhe enormity of the crime does not appal the females, though they are described to be affectionate and tender. We find a dancing girl pregnant by an Arreoy expressing herself thus to the English navigators: “Perhaps the Etοοa or deity of England might be offended with the practices of the Arreoys, but her own was not displeased with them. However, she promised if we would come from England for her child, she might perhaps keep it alive, provided we gave her a hatchet, a shirt, and some red feathers.” That the rules of the community are very strict, may be inferred from an instance given by Captain Bligh. A chief, a member of the society, married a sister of the king of Otaheite, by whom he had eight children, and the whole were destroyed at their birth! Nor did this enormity seem to originate from any other source, as the parents afterwards adopted a nephew as their heir.\n",
      "It may here be observed, that there are other practices among these people regarding infanticide, which, though we want materials for positively affirming the fact, may perhaps be connected with the institutions of the Arreoys. When an Otaheitan chief has a child by a woman of the lower orders, it is never suffered to live; and the like seems to take place reciprocally among the higher ranks of females. The king and queen of Otaheite having ceased to cohabit, he had taken another wife, and she associated with one of her atfendants of low rank. When pregnant, the missionaries endeavoured to persuade her to spare her child, which she said she would have done had it been her husband’s, but now it would be base-born, and must perish; and she resisted all entreaties to the contrary. Afterwards, having visited them, she excused herself for having put the infant to death, stating that it was the custom of the country to murder all base-born children, and hers being by a low man, she had only complied with the usual practice. Indeed it is affirmed by the missionaries who visited that island in 1797 to be a common proceeding among all ranks to strangle infants the moment they are born. “A perpetrator of this horrid act,” the narrator observes, “was among those whom curiosity attracted to visit us. She was a good-looking woman, and esteemed by the natives a great beauty, which I suppose to be the inducement that tempted her to murder her child; for here the number of women bearing no proportion to the men, those esteemed handsome were courted with great gifts, and got so accustomed to change their husbands, to go with them from place to place, and run after the diversions of the island, that rather than be debarred those pleasures, they stifle a parent’s feelings, and murder their tender children.” Thus many hundreddľ born into the world are never suffered to see the light; and so little criminality in the opinion of the natives is attached to the deed, that many women disclose the number they have put to death without scruple. It has bear calculated that at least two thirds of the births on the island perish in this manner.\n",
      "The Arreoys enjoy great privileges, and are everywhere united by the reciprocal ties of friendship and hospitality. When they visit different islands, they receive presents, and are entertained with feasting and dramatic exhibitions; and all this they seem to expect rather as a matter of right than of courtesy. Their clothes are of the finest materials. They pass their time in luxurious idleness, perfuming their hair with fragrant oils, singing and playing on the flute, and passing from one amusement to another. “Wherever they go,” says Forster, “the train of sensual pleasure awaits them.\" They feast on the choicest vegetables; and an abundance of dogs’ flesh and poultry are liberally provided by the lower classes for their entertainment. They are copiously supplied with kava; and for them are performed nocturnal sports of music and lascivious dances, to which no other spectators are admitted. Their presence seems to enliven the whole country; and among the various entertainments to which it gives birth, is one called hοpοwpah, of a dramatic nature, in which they themselves act a part. As soon as one Arreoy visits another, though a stranger, he immediately has his wants supplied and his wishes gratified; he is introduced' to other members, who vie with each other in loading him with courtesies and presents. They are of all others the most luxurious and profuse, often consuming the whole provisions of a district. When Captain Cook lay at Hua-hei∏e, no less than 70 canoes were observed crossing over to another island with 700 Arreoys on board; and thus they keep great meetings at appointed times, and travel in companies from one island to another. It has been affirmed, but perhaps without sufficient foundation, that a promiscuous intercourse of the sexes prevails in their society; however, they are permitted great latitude in their amours, except in times of danger, as almost all are fighting men. Sufficient inducements are, therefore, held out to be admitted into this mysterious community.\n",
      "Any one may withdraw at pleasure from the society; and an example is given of a chief who had killed his firstborn child, but preserved the second, having withdrawn in the interval. A woman who ceases to be an Arreoy incurs a reproachful name, signifying “bearer of children.” Thus, while in most other countries the name of parent confers honour, and respect, among the Arreoys of Otaheite it is used as a term of contempt and reproach. A chief of some repute, hearing that the king of Great Britain had a numerous offspring, declared that “he thought himself a much greater man, because he belonged to the Arreoys.”\n",
      "With respect to the origin of this society, Forster was the first to offer any conjectures, ii In a country,” says he, “which has emerged so lately from barbarism as Otaheite, we cannot suppose that such a community, which is evidently injurious to the rest of the nation, would have maintained itself to the present time, were not its advantages so considerable as to require its continuance.” There are two causes, he adds, which favour the existence of the Arreoys; first, the necessity for entertaining a body of warriors to defend. their fellow-citizens from the invasions and depredations of enemies; secondly, it was necessary, by such an association, to prevent the too rapid increase of the number of their chiefs. “Perhaps,” he remarks, “some intelligent Otaheitan lawgiver might foresee that the common people would at length groan űnder the yoke of such petty tyrants, whose number was ever multiplying.” The ordinary practice of infanticide is ascribed by Mr Wilson, who visited the South Seas in 1801, merely to the love of pleasure and avarice, which latter passion had gained great ascendancy since the intercourse of the islanders with Europeans: “being well aware,” says he, “that the beauty of females rearing families experiences an earlier decay, it is anxiously preserved for their visitors, by destruction of their offspring, or even by procuring abortion.” Before offering any opinion on this point, we shall notice a custom in the northwest of India somewhat analogous, which al\n",

      "extending from the equator to the Arctic Sea, necessarily possesses great variety of climate. But though here, as in every other country, the climate is regulated by the distance from the equator, this general law is modified by accidental causes, which it is curious to trace. In the wide extent of Asia great peculiarities of temperature occur, which cannot be very clearly explained. The system of the universe is conducted on so vast a scale that our faculties of observation do not keep pace with its great movements. How can we, for example, trace the rapid course of the winds, on which the temperature of countries so essentially depends, traversing as they do the whole space of the habitable globe at the rate of 1000 miles in 24 hours? How can we ascertain their origin and follow their progress, which is modified by the various interruptions of mountains, continents, and seas. How can we distinctly point out, amid such a complication of unknown facts, the connection between cause and effect? To such inquiries some uncertainty will always attach, and anomalies may appear of which we can oner no solution. In these circumstances, facts are our only sure guides; and to these, therefore, în the following observations, we shall endeavour to adhere.\n",
      "The height of the land above the level of the sea is as sure a cause of cold as distance from the equator; and countries are not only cold in proportion to their height, but a mass of cold air is accumulated above them, which, being dispersed, is carried towards the equator, and extends the dominion of cold into the regions of heat. Land and water, also, are the causes either of heat or cold, according to their situation. The great mass of the ocean is little affected by the changes of the seasons; and it consequently preserves the medium temperature of the whole year. Hence the vicinity of the ocean cools the temperature of the equinoctial regions; and in higher latitudes it moderates the extremes both of heat and cold, being in winter of a higher temperature, and in summer of a lower temperature, than the superincumbent air. The surface of the earth, again, imbibes heat or cold much more readily than the ocean; and it is only at considerable depths that it is found to give the medium temperature of the year. The vicinity of land, therefore, in the polar countries, is the cause of cold, while in the southern regions of the equator it is an equally powerful cause of heat. Thus Africa, which extends so far to the south, and which contains a greater proportion of land within the tropics than any other division of the globe, is a vast store-house of heat, from which it is dispersed far and wide, and even reaches the shores of Europe in hot and parching winds; while, on the other hand, the breadth and extent of the American continent towards the north sufficiently accounts for the coldness of its climate, the north-west winds which sweep across its frozen wastes extending their inroads into the regions of heat as far sometimes as Mexico or Vera Cruz.^[7. See Humboldt’s Political Essay on the Kingdom of Nero Spain. He mentions, that at Vera Cruz the centigrade thermometer sometimes falls, owing to those northern blasts, to 0 or to 32 degrees of Fahrenheit; and that even at Mexico they sometimes, though .rarely, bring down the thermometer to the freezing point. ] The influence of the ocean in moderating the severity of the winter is exemplified in the climate of Great Britain, where no such intense cold ever prevails as in corresponding latitudes on the continent of Europe, and more especially on that of Asia. The climate of a country is also affected by the direction of the winds; and hence the eastern shores of America, owing to the tradewinds, which blow from the east, and are cooled in their passage across the Atlantic, have not the same sultry heats as the opposite shores of Africa, where the same winds are heated to an intense degree in their passage over the burning deserts of the interior. The northern frontiers of Asia, and its prodigious elevation towards the centre, necessarily consign the greatest portion of it to the dominion of cold. Among, the central mountains perpetual winter reigns; and from these snowy deserts the influence of cold is widely extended over the high plains of the interior. In Thibet, which is about the same latitude as Northern Africa or Arabia, namely, between the 30th and 35th degrees, there is a continuous and severe winter of three months, which is of such uniform severity that at its commencement the Inhabitants kill their meat, and it is kept perfectly fresh for three months.^[8. Turner’s Embassy to Thibet, p. 217, 301, 35G. ] To the west, along the whole range of elevated land that extends into Persia and to the Caspian Sea, the climate is modified by the elevation of the ground. In the countries of Balk aqd Buckharia, which lie on the northern declivity of the great ridge of the Hindoo Coosh Mountains, in the same latitude as the south of Europe, namely, the 39th and 40th degrees, and all along the banks of the Oxus, the climate is remarkably severe. For three months the winter is intensely cold, the wind being dry and piercing, and the snow lying deep on the ground. The rivers are all frozen over, and the Oxus during all that period is passable for caravans.^[9. Fraser’s Narrative of a Journey into Khorassan, Appendix, p. 95. ] The summer, again, is equally hot. Persia, in like manner, being nearly in the same latitude as Arabia, the hottest part of the earth, and having an excessively hot summer, has in the northern and central parts the severe winter of a northern climate, with drifting snow, which lies deep on the ground for three months; and this is owing entirely to its elevation, which is estimated by Fraser to be 4000 feet above the Caspian Sea.^[10. Kinneir’s Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire, p. 122. It is mentioned in the Journal of a Mr Campbell, quoted by Sir J. Malcolm, that while he was at Tabreez a heavy fall of snow occurred in May; and in December and January the thermometer at night was never above zero. (Sir J. Malcolm’s History of Persia, vol. ii. p. 509.) ] The lower valleys and exterior plains of Asia, which lie to the south of the Himalaya Mountains, including Arabia, the southern and flat parts of Persia, Hindostan, and India beyond the Ganges, constitute the tropical and warm regions of this continent, of which the climate, though it agrees in general with their position on the globe, still varies from local causes. Hindostan, for example, and India beyond the Ganges, though they approach nearer to the equator, are not nearly so hot as Arabia or the adjacent countries. The course of the seasons is also more constant; and it is here that we meet with those remarkable winds, the monsoons, which blow six months in opposite directions, from the south-west and north-east, with some slight variations, and which extend their influence over all the countries which lie between the mouth of the Indus and the Chinese Sea. The monsoons follow the course of the sun, and this fact points to the cause of the phenomenon. Heat and cold being the great agents which, by rarefying or condensing the air, disturb its equilibrium, and set the* ’ winds in motion, land, when it is heated by the solar rays, acts on the superincumbent air, and causes it to ascend, when it is immediately replaced by an irruption of cold air from the sea. Hence the regular sea-breeze which prevails in all the tropical islands during the day, and the opposite current from the land during the night; and this alternation of the sea and the land breezes, occasioned within 24 hours by the varying temperature of an island, is’just an example of the effect that must be produced by a heated continent and by the change of the seasons. As the sun advances into the northern tropic, the land of Asia, Europe, and almost the whole of Africa, is heated by his influence; by which the air being rarefied, and rising aloft, a current of colder air rushes in from the sea. Accordingly it is found, that with the approach of summer, the plains of Hindostan, Burmah, and China, heated by the intense rays of a vertical sun, violently attract the cold air, which flows with a steady stream from the Southern Ocean, exactly in the tract of the heated continent, ’ namely, from the south-west to the north-east. When the sun passes into the southern hemisphere, the monsoon alters its course. Winter now reigns in the mountainous and northern parts of Asia, and the heat in the lower regions is not so great. The land, in place.of heating, cools the air, which flows into the warm regions of the south from the north-east in the direction of the continent, as it formerly flowed towards the north from the south-east.’ The south-west monsoon sets in about the beginning of June in all the islands of the Indian Ocean, and traverses the southern plains, until it is turned towards the west by the central mountains, and finally arrested in its progress. It is ushered in with the most tremendous thunder and lightning, with tempests of wind and floods of rain. This is the commencement of the periodical rains through all the tropical regions of Asia, which are at their height in July, and gradually abate about the end of September, departing amid thunders and tempests, as they came. Before the setting in of the monsoons there is a clear sky, with a hot parching wind, succeeded by sultry calms, under which all nature seems to droop. The rains effect a sudden and total change in the aspect of the country: the rivers are swollen, the air is pure and refreshing, the sky varied with clouds, and the earth covered with the most luxuriant verdure.^[11. Elphinstone’s Account of Cabul, chap. v. ] Such is the climate of Southern Asia, from China to the coast of Africa. But the peninsula of Arabia is not subject to the influence of the monsoons; and in place of the tropical rains, it has generally, in the \n",

      "so called from the bitumen which floats upon its surface, and equally well known under the name of the Dead Sea, a name associated with many fables, and derived from a long standing belief that no creature could live in its waters, or within the reach of its pestiferous exhalations.\n",
      "# Very different accounts have been given of the dimensions and other properties of this lake, by the ancient writers Diodorus, Pliny, Strabo, and Josephus. These accounts have, however, been corrected by modern travellers, although, from the difficulty of approaching it, their information is not so full or accurate as might be desired. Pliny estimates it to be 100 miles in length by 25 in breadth. Josephus reckons the length, from the mouth of the Jordan to the town of Segor, 66 miles, and the breadth 15 miles. This agrees with the estimate of modern travellers, which is 60 or 70 miles in length and from 10 to 20 in breadth. Carne, in his Letters from the East, estimates the length at 60 miles, and the breadth at from 8 to 10. It is about 180 miles in circuit. In form it is curved like a bow, and placed between two ranges of mountains, bold and craggy, and of the most majestic appearance, by which it is sheltered, so that when the wind is blowing all around it is perfectly calm like a sheet of lead. But the grandeur of its features is blended with an air of sadness and desolation, and all travellers have been struck with the death-like stillness of its waters, which seem to accord well with its mysterious character and name. This lake has been seldom visited, owing to the wild Arabs who inhabit the country, and who rob and murder without mercy the defenceless traveller. Mr Buckingham, who had only a distant view of it, mentions that the inhabitants who live within 15 miles distance of its shores have no information respecting it, and believe in all the wonderful tales and superstitions which are circulated of its marvellous properties. It was since visited by Mr Carne, whose Letters contain a lively picture of eastern scenery and manners; and his representation of the death-like stillness of this lake and the adjacent country agrees with that of all former travellers. “There was not,” he observes, when he visited it, “a breath of wind; and the waters lay dead on the shore. Whoever has seen the Dead Sea will have its aspect impressed on his memory. It is in truth a gloomy and fearful spectacle. The precipices in general descend abruptly into the lake, and on account of their height it is seldom agitated by the winds. Its shores are not visited by any footstep save that of the wild Arab, and he holds it in superstitious dread. On some parts of the rocks there is a thick sulphureous incrustation, which appears foreign to their substance; and in their steep descents there are several deep caverns, where the benighted Bedouin sometimes finds a home.” The same writer observes, that though the sun shone full on the bosom of the lake, and though it had the appearance of a plain of burnished gold, yet “the sadness of the grave was on it and around it, and the silence also. However vivid the feelings are on arriving on its shores, they subside after a time into languor aηd uneasiness; and you long, if it were possible, to see a tempest wake on its bosom, to give sound and life to the scene.”^[1. Letters from the East, by J. Came. ]\n",
      "The lake Asphaltites receives the waters of the river Jordan, and other brooks and springs from the adjacent mountains, yet never overflows, though it has no visible outlet for those copious Supplies. This fact seems to have embarrassed some naturalists, who, in order to account for it, have had recourse to the hypothesis of a secret communication with the Mediterranean. But it has been demonstrated by accurate calculation, that evaporation is more than sufficient to carry off the waters brought by the river. Under the influence of a dry and hot climate, it is in fact very considerable, and frequently becomes sensible to the eye by the fogs with which the lake is covered at the rising of the sun, and which are afterwards dispersed by the heat. To the north it has the plain of Jericho, and to the south extends, on both sides of the Jordan, the great plain, which is open, and stretches beyond the reach of the eye. It is this plain of which, according to Mr Buckingham, Josephus gives so accurate a description.\n",
      "This lake is supposed to occupy the site of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, destroyed by fire, as is recorded in the sacred volume, for their unparalleled iniquities; and the strange properties ascribed to its waters, and other marvellous stories connected with it, seem to have a reference to this awful tradition. It was at one time supposed that no living creature could exist in its waters—that they exhaled such a poisonous effluvia that the birds of the air died in attempting to fly over it. The apples that were said to grow on its shores, fair without, but full of ashes and bitterness within, were also supposed to contain some moral or illustration of its ancient story; and it was affirmed that the ruins of the five cities which were destroyed by fire were still seen at the bottom of the lake in clear weather. Josephus mentions that a constant smoke was seen to arise from its surface. Almost all these stories have been exploded by the testimony of modern travellers, although some of them have an obvious foundation in the physical properties of the waters. Their taste is remarkably bitter, saline, and pungent; and hence has arisen the notion of its pestiferous vapours and deadly influence. We are told even by Volney, that its waters are destructive both of animal and vegetable life; but he denies that its vapours have any deadly quality, for swallows, he says, are often seen to skim its surface without injury. Μ. de Chateaubriand, who visited its shores in 1807, with an imagination abundantly disposed to the marvellous, has given the first decided testimony that it abounds in fish. He reached the lake when it was already dark, and passed the night among some Arab tents. “About midnight,” says he, “I heard a noise upon the lake, and was told by the Bethlehemites who accompanied me, that it proceeded from legions of small fish which come out and leap about on the shore.” This interesting traveller speaks in the following terms of its saline properties :—“The first thing I did on alighting was to walk into the lake up to my knees, and to taste the water. I found it impossible to keep it in my mouth. It far exceeds that of the sea in saltness, and produces upon the lips the effect of a strong solution of alum. Before my boots were completely dry, they were covered with salt; our clothes, our hats, our hands, were in less than three hours impregnated with this mineral.”\n",
      "The common story, that nothing will sink in it, is to be ascribed to the extraordinary density of its waters. Bodies follow the general law, and sink or swim, according to the proportion of their gravity to the gravity of the water of the lake; but its specific gravity is such that a man may lie upon its surface motionless, without danger of sinking. This effect was experienced by Pococke, and by a Scotish traveller, Mr Gordon of Clunie, who also bathed in it. This gentleman brought home a phial of its water, and Dr Marcet found its specific gravity to be 1’211; “a degree of density,” says he, “not to be met with in any other natural water.” Dr Marcet was employed to analyse Mr Gordon’s specimen, which that gentleman had presented to Sir Joseph Bankes in 1807; and the whole process, with its results, is detailed in the Philosophical Transactions for that year. It was found that 100 grains of the water contains the following substances, in the under-mentioned proportions :—\n",
      "Grains.\n",
      "Muriate of lime 3∙920\n",
      "Muriate of magnesia 10∙246\n",
      "Muriate of soda 10∙360\n",
      "Sulphate of lime 0∙054\n",
      "24∙580\n",
      "The water of the Dead Sea had been previously analysed by Messrs Macquer, Lavoisier, and Sage, of whose experiments an account was published in the Mémoires de ľAcademie des Sciences for the year 1778. Their analysis afforded results greatly different from those obtained by Dr Marcet, which that gentleman ascribes to some inaccuracy in their mode of operating. We find, however, that the processes employed by Dr Marcet have been called in question, and the accuracy of his proportions denied, by a very skilful chemist, who subsequently instituted an analysis of the Dead Sea water. We allude to Klaproth, who procured a specimen brought from the East by the Abbé Mariti, and whose analysis offered the following proportions :—\n",
      "Muriate of magnesia 24∙20\n",
      "Muriate of lime 10∙60\n",
      "Muriate of soda 7∙80\n",
      "42∙60\n",
      "Water 57∙40\n",

      "Klaproth also found the specific gravity to be 1∙245 instead of 1∙211; agreeing in this respect more nearly with Macquer and Lavoisier, who stated it at 1*240. The specific gravity of Dr Marcet’s specimen may, however, have been less from its having been taken from the lake not far from the influx of the Jordan, on which account it might be somewhat diluted.\n",
      "Dr Clarke mentions that the inhabitants of the country still regard the Dead Sea with feelings of terror. This may be owing to the tradition that its waters cover the engulphed cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, or to the ideas entertained of the peculiar insalubrity of its exhalations. It is much to be regretted that this traveller was prevented by the Arabs, who infested the neighbourhood, from exploring the lake, which he only saw at some distance; as, with his attainments, he could not have failed to gather some interesting information regarding its natural history. Though Μ. de Chateaubriand, a few years after, succeeded in reaching its banks, he could only, owing to the same cause, remain a few hours; and besides, however capable of interesting his readers, he was not so well qualified for accurate or scientific observation.

      "which had as yet only consisted of a knowledge of isolated facts, acquired a systematic form, and almost a new existence, from the genius and assiduity of Hipparchus, one of the most astonishing men of antiquity, and perhaps the greatest of all in the sciences which are not purely speculative. This illustrious founder of astronomical science was born at Nice in Bythinia, and observed at Rhodes. Flamsteed and Cassini, probably mis-Λed by some ambiguous expressions of Ptolemy, have related that his observations were made at Alexandria; and this opinion seems generally to have been adopted by historians. The question has been examined carefully, and at considerable length, by Delambre (Astronomie Ancienne), who comes to the conclusion that there is no reason whatever to infer that Hipparchus ever saw Alexandria. Ptolemy, in reporting the observations of Hipparchus, supposed Rhodes and Alexandria to be situated on the same meridian, and consequently does not find it necessary to mention the place at which the observations were made.\n",
      "Hipparchus commenced his brilliant career by verifying the determination of the obliquity of the ecliptic made by Eratosthenes. He next directed his attention to the length of the tropical year. By comparing an observation of his own, of the summer solstice, with a similar one made by Aristarchus 140 years before, he found that the anciently received value of 365į days was too great by seven minutes. This leaves the tropical year a value still too great; but it is probable that the error arose from the inaccuracy of the observation of Aristarchus: for the observations of Hipparchus, compared with those of the moderns, make the length of the tropical year amount to 365 days, 5 hours, and 49 minutes, which is only 12 seconds greater than the truth. By a careful observation of the solstices and equinoxes, he discovered that the year is not divided by these points into four equal parts, the sun occupying 94⅜ days in passing from the vernal equinox to the summer solstice, and only 92į from the same solstice to the equinox of autumn. The sun, consequently, remained 187 days in that part of the ecliptic which lies between the equator and the north pole, and therefore only about 178 in the other part. This observation led Hipparchus to the great discovery of the eccentricity of the solar orbit. He accounted for the apparent inequality of the sun’s motion, by supposing that the earth is not placed exactly at the centre of the circular orbit of the sun, and that consequently his distance from the earth is subject to variation. When the sun is at his greatest distance, he appears to move more slowly; and when he approaches nearer, his motion becomes more rapid. The distance of the earth from the centre of the orbit is called the eccentricity : it produces an equation between the real and apparent motions, which is called the equation of the centre. He determined the magnitude of this equation in terms of the radius of the ecliptic, and fixed the position of the line of the apsides, or that which joins the two opposite points of the orbit which are at the greatest and least distance from the earth. With these data he formed the first tables of the sun which are mentioned in the history of astronomy. The discovery of the eccentricity also led Hipparchus to that of the inequality of the lengths of the solar days at different seasons of the year. In the interval which elapses between the sun’s passage over the meridian and his return to it the following day, the sun advances by his own proper motion towards the east nearly a degree. But the rate of this motion is unequal, varying between 57 and 61 minutes of a degree; and the accumulation of · the inequalities forms what iā called the equation of time, that is, the difference between the true time, as shown by the sun, and the mean time, shown by a well-regulated clock, the motions of which are equal and uniform.\n",
      "The attention of Hipparchus was next directed to the motions of the moon; and on this subject his researches were attended with equal success. From the comparison of a great number of the most circumstantial and accurate-observations of eclipses recorded by the Chaldeans, he was enabled to determine the period of the moon’s revo-' lutιon relatively to the stars, to the sun, to her nodes, and to her apogee. These determinations are among the most precious relics of ancient astronomy, inasmuch as they corroborate the results of theory in one of its finest deductions—the acceleration of the mean lunar motion—and thus furnish one of the most delicate tests öf the truth of Newton’s law of gravitation. It was, indeed, by a comparison of the observations of Hipparchus with those of the Arabian and modern astronomers, that Dr Halley was led to the discovery of that curious and important phenomenon. Hipparchus also determined the eccentricity of the lunar orbit, and its inclination to the plane of the ecliptic; and the values which he assigned to these elements, making allowance for the evection and the inequalities of the moon's motion in latitude, are to a few minutes the same as those which are now observed. He had also an idea of the second inequality of the moon’s motion, namely, the eveetion, and made all the necessary preparations for a discovery which was reserved for Ptolemy. He likewise approximated to the parallax of the moon, which he attempted to deduce from that of the sun, by determining the length of the frustum cut off from the cone of the terrestrial shadow by the moon when she traverses it in her eclipses. From the parallax he concluded that the greatest and least distances of the moon are respectively equal to 78 and 67 semi-diameters of the earth, and that the distance of the sun is equal to 1300 of the same semi-diameters. The first of these determinations exceeds the truth; the second falls greatly short of it, the distance of the sun being nearly equal to 24,000 terrestrial semi-diameters. It may, however, be remarked that Ptolemy, who undertook to correct Hipparchus with regard to the parallax, deviated still farther from the truth.\n",
      "The apparition of a new star in the time of Hipparchus induced him to undertake the formation of a catalogue of all the stars visible above his horizon, to fix their relative positions, and mark their configurations, in order that posterity might have the means of observing any changes which might in future take place in the state of the heavens. This arduous undertaking was rewarded by the important discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, one of the fundamental elements of astronomy. By comparing his own observations with those of Aristillus and Timocharis, he found that the first point of Aries, which, in the time of these astronomers, or 150 years before, corresponded with the vernal equinox, had advanced two degrees, according to the order of the signs, or at the rate of 48 seconds a year. This determination is not very far from the truth; for, according to modern observations, the rate of the precession is about 50T seconds annually. His catalogue contained 1080 stars: it is generally, but erroneously, stated to have contained only 1022, after that of Ptolemy, in which the nebulous and some obscure stars are omitted. He also commenced a series of observations to furnish his successors with the means of forming a theory of the planets. Hipparchus likewise invented the planisphere, or method of representing the starry firmament on a plane surface, which afforded the means of solving the problems of spherical trigonometry in a manner often more exact and more commodious than the globe itself. He was the first who demonstrated the methods of calculating triangles, whether rectilineal or spherical; and he constructed a table of chords, from which he drew nearly the same advantages as we derive at present from the tables of sines. Geography is also indebted to him for the happy idea of fixing the position of places on  the earth by means of their latitudes and longitudes; 'and he was the first who determined the longitude by the eclipses of the moon.\n",
      "These various labours and brilliant discoveries give a high idea of the industry and genius of Hipparchus. His writings have unfortunately all perished, excepting a commentary on the poem of Aratus; but the principal elements of his theories, together with a few observations, have been preserved in the Almagest of Ptolemy.\n",
      "After the death of Hipparchus, nearly three centuries elapsed before any successor arose worthy of the name. During this long period astronomy gained no essential advancement. Some rude observations, scarcely superior to those of the Chaldeans, and a few meagre treatises, are the only monuments which exist to testify that science had not fallen into utter oblivion in an age so fertile of poets and orators. Geminus and Cleomedes wrote treatises, which have been preserved to our times; Agrippa and Menelaus are said to have observed; the Roman calendar was reformed by Julius Caesar and the Egyptian astronomer Sosigenes; and Posidonius measured a degree, and remarked that the laws of the tides depend on the motions of the sun and moon.\n",
      "Ptolemy was born at Ptolemais in Egypt, and flourished at Alexandria about the 130th year of our era, under the reigns of Adrian and Antoninus. This illustrious ornament of the Alexandrian school is entitled by his own discoveries to the high rank among astronomers which has universally been assigned to him; but the most signal service which he conferred on science was the collection and arrangement of the ancient observations. Out of these materials he formed the Miyαλtj '∑υvτaξις, or Great Composition, a collection which exhibits a complete view of the state of astronomy in the time of Ptolemy, and which contains the germ of most of the methods in use at the present day.\n",

      "a great and illustrious French poet, was born at Ferte-Milon on the 21st of December. 1630. He was the son of John Racine, controller of the salt magazine of that city, and of Joan Sconin, daughter of the king’s warden of thewoods and waters Of Villers-Caterets. Deprived of his father and mother at the early age of three, he passed under tile guardianship of his paternal grandfather, also named John Racine, who, not long afterwards, bequeathed the trust to his widow. He studied first at Beauvais; next at Paris, in the college of Fearcount; and lastly at Port-Royal-des-Champs, whither a number of eminent persons had retired to devote themselves to piety and the instruction of youth, amongst whom were the advocate Lemaitre, Dr. Hamon, Nicole, Lacy, and Launcelot, authors of the Logic, the General Grammar, and other works, known under the title of Me· thodes de Port-Royal. Launcelot, in particular, undertook to teach Greek to the youthful Racine. But besides the taste for sound literature and serious studies, these mn-mortal solitaries inspired their pupil with those religious principles which never abandoned him, and which were common to an the great writers and great men of that age. The docility of Racine towards his masters equalled his ardour for study. On one occasion, however, he showed himself refractory. Having accidentally met with the Greek romance of Theagenes and Chariclea, he commenced the perusal of this work of fiction, when his master surprising him, whilst thus engaged, took from him the book, and consigned it to the flames. The youth procured another copy, and learned it by heart, after which he placed it in the hands of Launcelot, saying, “You may bum this also.” An act of disobedience of a kind so novel was the more readily excused because it was not likely to have many imitators.\n",
      "The first poetical essay of Racine was La Nymphe de la Seine, an ode which he composed for the marriage of Louis XIV. and which having made him known to Chaplain, the temporary arbiter of literary reputations and court favours, produced him a hundred louis, which Colbert sent him on the part of the king; and not long afterwards, he received a pension of six hundred livres. Four years later, towards the close of 1663, another ode, La Renommée aux Muses, composed on the occasion of the establishment of the three Academies, procured for him a second royal gratuity, the order for which was couched in terms peculiarly flattering to the youthful poet. This ode, though inferior to the preceding, was nevertheless more fortunate. Recompensed, like the other, by the king, it had the good fortune to be criticised by Boileau. The poet took an early opportunity to thank the critic, and this proved the origin of that connexion so intimate, so honourable, so useful to Racine, and which was not one of the least advantages which fortune gave him over Corneille. A little before this period, Racine had made the acquaintance of Molière, and had communicated to him a tragedy, entitled Theagene et Chari-clee, taken from the romance, which had afforded him such delight at Port-Royal. Molière, disapproving of this production, gave him the plan of the Thébaide, ou les Frères Ennemis, a subject on which it is alleged that he had himself been engaged. Racine executed the design, and the piece had some success. Alexandre, which was performed the following year, 1665, met with a still more favourable reception, and showed great progress in the versification of the author, who was then only twenty-five years of age. But, excepting the verses, neither of these works gave any indication of what Racine afterwards proved. They were but feeble imitations of Corneille, of whom, by a misfortune common to all imitators, Racine had only adopted the defects; that is, the cold gallantry mixed with heroism, the idle maxims, the metaphysical reasonings, and the elaborate declamation. Corneille, to whom Racine read his Alexandre, counselled him, it is said, to write no more tragedies. At a subsequent period the same advice was given to Voltaire by Fontenelle, after the reading of Brutus. But it is fortunate for letters that such counsels are never followed. Voltaire replied to Fontenelle by the production of Zaire, and Racine responded to Comeille by that of his Andro-maque. Finding himself pursuing a wrong direction, he suddenly changed his route and took a different one, unknown perhaps even to Comeille himself. The latter had astonished and surprised his audience; his young rival sought to move and to soften them. Pity appeared to him a tragic resource more active, more extensive, and of an effect more penetrating and less transitory, than admiration. He studied the human heart, its passions, its weaknesses, and its most secret recesses, and there he discovered a species of tragedy altogether new, of which he gave the first and probably most inimitable model in his Andromaque; that one of all his tragedies which, without being the most perfect, produces the greatest effect on the stage, by the vigorous and just expression of the sentiments and characters, and by the alternations of hope and fear, of terror and pity, with which the poet agitates the soul.\n",
      "The representation of the Andromaque in 1667, was followed almost every year by a new masterpiece. But at first Racine surprised the public by an excursion into the domain of Molière. The Plaideurs, imitated from the Wasps of Aristophanes, is a comedy the plot of which is somewhat feeble and inartificial; but in nature, truth, facility, and gaiety, it is admirable, and its verses became so fixed in the general mind that they passed into proverbs. The piece was first represented at Paris in 1668, when it was indifferently received; but it succeeded pretty well at Versailles, and the players, elated with the success, came to awaken Racine in the middle of the night, to communicate the good news. The noise of vehicles at such an hour, in the Rue des Marais, convinced first the neighbours, and next day all Paris, that justice had avenged itself on the author of the Plaideurs, by causing him to be seized and sent to the Bastille. This pleasant mistake, and the knowledge which soon became general, that the comedy had obtained the suffrage of the monarch, conciliated the favour of the loyal Parisians; and from that time the piece has continued in possession of the stage, privileged to extort a smile, perchance a laugh, even from the iron visage of justice herself It is not true, as has sometimes been said, that the Plaideurs is the work of several hands. Racine may have received from his friends hints or suggestions for some scenes, and borrowed from certain hommes de palais, or gentlemen of the robe, some formulas and expressions foreign to his habitual studies; but the unity of the style and the general coherence of the whole are too perfect to be the work of any but one and the same hand.\n",
      "The success of the Andromaque, which was only equalled by that of the Cid, had excited envy; perhaps, also, it had rendered the public fastidious. In 1669, Britannicus was coldly received, and with difficulty reached the eighth representation. At first no one felt the truth, the depth, and the force displayed in the magnificent historical picture of Nero and his court. Boileau alone was struck with its merit, and hurrying to embrace Racine, he exclaimed, “Voila ce que vous avez fait de mieux.” This great critic was not only useful to Racine in praising his performance, his severity was of full more service in inducing him to suppress two scenes which deformed his work; one between Burrhus and Narcissa, at the commencement of the third act; and another, in the fifth, in which Junia is brought back into the presence of Nero. Britannicus was followed by Berenice, which, in some respects, is one of the most remarkable of Racine’s works. At the solicitation of the celebrated Henrietta of England, Racine and Corneille both treated this subject which is so little fitted for representation, neither being aware that the other was engaged upon it. Besides the pleasure of seeing two illustrious rivals unconsciously contending for the palm, this princess secretly promised herself another, in the treatment of the heroic separation of the two august lovers; but a premature death deprived her of the pleasure she had anticipated, in witnessing this singular competition. Three words of Suetonius represent the subject of the piece: Invitus invitam dimisit; too slight a foundation upon which to work, and in the case of Corneille, who was now old, an ungrateful task, far more dangerous to him than even to Racine. The two rival plays were represented towards the close of 1670; that of Corneille at the Palais-Royal, by the company of Molière, and that of Racine at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. Corneille’s totally failed; that of Racine had thirty consecutive representations, during which it drew tears alike from the court and the city. The great Conde replied to some criticisms which were made in his hearing in the following verses of the piece itself:\n",
      "Depuis cinq ans entiers chaque jour je la vois,\n",
      "Et crois toujours la voir pour la première fois.\n",
      "It has been said, and even zealous admirers of Racine have confessed, that Berenice was not a veritable tragedy. But, tragedy or drama, what signifies the title which maybe given to it, provided we be agreed that it is a miracle of art, and that never, in any piece, were greater difficulties more meritoriously overcome. The style possesses exquisite beauties in detail, and an inexpressible charm pervades the diction throughout.\n",
      "Bajazet appeared in 1672, and obtained immediate vogue, partly, no doubt, from the novelty of the manners and costumes, but in a greater degree, from admiration of the force and truth with which the poet had delineated the characters of Roxana and Acomat; two real creations, which, in spite of all its faults, will make Bgjazet immortal. At the same time, there is not a little truth in \n",

      "Ann, the celebrated author of the Romance of the Forest, and the Mysteries of Udolpho, was born in London on the 9th of July 1764. She was the daughter of William and Ann Ward, who, though in trade, were respectably connected, and nearly the only persons of their two families not living in handsome, or at least easy independence. Her paternal grandmother was a Cheselden, the sister of the celebrated surgeon, of whose kind regard her father had a grateful recollection; and her maternal grandmother was Anne Oates, sister of Dr. Samuel Jebb of Stratford, the father of Sir Richard, on which side she was also related to Dr. Halifax, bishop of Gloucester, and to a gentleman of the same name, who was physician to the king. Of the history of her early years, during which the mind usually gives indications of its prevailing tendencies, no record whatever has been preserved. About the time of her twentieth year, however, she is described as possessing a figure exquisitely proportioned, a fine complexion, a beautiful and expressive countenance, and tastes which led her to take delight in contemplating the glories of creation, particularly the grander features they display, listening to music skilfully performed, hearing passages from the Greek and Latin classics recited and translated, and preferring the pleasures of meditation to those of society.\n",
      "Thus respectably born and connected, Miss Ward, at the age of twenty-three, acquired the name which she subsequently rendered so celebrated, by marrying Mr. William Radcliffe, a graduate of Oxford, and then a student of law. This gentleman, however, renounced the prosecution of his legal studies, and afterwards became proprietor and editor of the English Chronicle. Mrs. Radcliffe having thus a strong inducement to cultivate her literary powers, first came before the public as a novelist in 1789, two years after her marriage, and when she was yet only twenty-five years of age. The romance which she then produced, however, gave but a faint indication of the eminent powers afterwards displayed by the author. In the Castles Of Athlin and Dun-bαyne, the scene is laid in Scotland during the dark ages, but without any attempt to delineate the peculiar manners or scenery of that country; and although we may trace some germs of that talent for the wild, the romantic, and the mysterious, which she afterwards employed with so much effect, yet, on the whole, this production cannot be regarded as at all worthy of her pen. Mrs. Radcliffe’s genius, however, was more advantageously displayed in the Sicilian Romance, which appeared in 1790, and attracted a considerable share of public attention. This work displays the exuberant fertility Of imagination which formed the principal characteristic of the author’s mind. Adventures heaped on adventures, in rapid and brilliant succession,with all the hair-breadth charms of escape or capture, hurry the reader along with them; whilst the imagery and scenery by which the action is relieved, resemble those of a splendid oriental tale. Still the work bore marked traces of the defects incident to an unpractised author. The scenes were inartificially connected, and the characters hastily sketched, without any attempt at individual distinctions; the staple materials consisted of ardent lovers and tyrannical parents, with domestic ruffians, guards, and others, who had wept or stormed through the scenes of romance, without much change of character or features, for half a century before. Nevertheless, this praise may be claimed for Mrs. Radcliffe, that she was the first to introduce into her prose fictions a beautiful and fanciful tone of natural description and impressive narrative, which had hitherto been exclusively applied to poetry. Her style was as full of imagination as her subject, and she established a clear title to be considered as the first poetess of romantic fiction, that is, taking poetry in its true acceptation, apart from the mere accessory of rhythm.\n",
      "The Romance of the Forest appealed in the year 1791,and at once raised the author to that pre-eminence in her own style of composition, which her works have ever since maintained. In this new effort, her fancy was more regulated, and subjected to the fetters of a regular story. The characters, too, were depicted with skill far superior to that which the author had hitherto displayed, and the work attracted the public attention in proportion. That of La Motte, indeed, is sketched with particular talent, and the interest of the piece mainly depends upon the vacillations of a character, which weakness and vice are at every moment on the point of rendering an agent in the greatest atrocities. He is the exact picture of the needy man who has known better days; one who, spited at the world, from which he had been driven with contempt, and condemned to seek an asylum in a desolate mansion full of mysteries and horrors, avenges himself by playing the gloomy despot within his own family, and tyrannising over those who were subjected to him only by their strong sense of duty. The heroine, too, has some pleasant touches of originality, which she displays in her grateful affection for the La Motte family, and her reliance on their truth and honour, when the wife had become unkind, and the father treacherous. But this was not the department of art on which Mrs. Radcliffe’s popularity rested. “The public,” says Sir Walter Scott, “were chiefly aroused, or rather fascinated, by the wonderful conduct of a story, in which the author so successfully called out the feelings of mystery and awe, while chapter after chapter, and incident after incident, maintained the thrilling attraction of awakened curiosity and suspended interest. Of these every reader felt the force, from the sage in his study, to the family group in middle life, which assembles round the evening taper, to seek a solace from the toils of ordinary existence, by an excursion into the regions of imagination. The tale was the more striking, because varied and relieved by descriptions of the ruined mansion, and the forest with which it is surrounded, under so many different points of view, now pleasing and serene, now gloomy, now terrible; scenes which could only have been drawn by one to whom nature had given the eye of a painter, with the spirit of a poet.”\n",
      "In 1798 Mrs. Radcliffe visited the scenery on the Rhine, and it is supposed that the Mysteries of Udolpho were written, or at least corrected, after the period of this journey; the mouldering castles of the robber-chivalry of Germany, situated on the romantic banks of that celebrated stream, having, it is thought, given a bolder flight to her imagination, and a more glowing character to her colouring. The scenery on the Lakes of Westmoreland, which Mrs. Radcliffe had about the same period visited, was also calculated to awaken her fancy; nature having in these wild but beautiful regions, realised the descriptions in which she delighted toin-dulge. Her remarks upon the countries through which she travelled were given to the public in 1793, under the title of a Journey through Holland, &c. This, however, was merely a sort of intercalary production. As already hinted, her next effort in the province of romance, was the Mysteries of Udolpho, Of this much was of course expected; and the booksellers felt themselves authorised in offering for the work, what was then considered as an unprecedented sum, namely, L.500. But although a writer’s previous reputation often proves the greatest enemy he has to encounter in a second attempt upon public favour, yet Mrs. Radcliffe’s popularity stood the test, and was enhanced rather than abated by the Mysteries of Udolpho. “ The very name,” says Scott, “was fascinating; and the public, who rushed upon it with all the eagerness of curiosity, rose from it with unsated appetite.” The author pursuing her own favourite bent of composition, and again waving her wand over the world of wonder and imagination, had judiciously employed a spell of broader and more potent command. Every thing in the Mysteries of Udolpho is on a larger and more sublime scale than in the Romance of the Forest. The interest is of a more agitating and tremendous nature; the scenery is of a wilder and more terrific description; the characters are distinguished by fiercer and more gigantic features. “Mon-toni, a lofty-souled desperado, and captain of Condottieri, stands beside La Motte and his Marquis, like one of Milton’s fiends beside a witch’s familiar. Adeline is confined within a ruined mansion-house; but her sister-heroine, Emily, is imprisoned in a huge castle, like those of feudal times. The one is attacked and defended by bands of armed banditti; the other only threatened by a visit from constables and thief-takers. The scale of the landscape is equally different; the quiet and limited woodland scenery of the one work, forming a contrast with the splendid and high-wrought descriptions of Italian mountain grandeur which occur in the other. In a word, the Mysteries of Udolpho was, at its first appearance, considered as a step beyond Mrs. Radcliffe’s former work, high as it had justly raised her; and this impression has been confirmed by subsequent comparative perusal.”\n",
      "The next production by which Mrs-Radcliffe arrested the attention of the public, was destined to be her last. The Italian, which appeared in 1797, was purchased by the booksellers for L.800, and favourably received by the public. Sir Walter Scott praises the author for her judgment “in taking such a point of distance and distinction, that while employing her own peculiar talent, and painting in the style of which she may be considered the inventor, she cannot be charged with repeating or copying herself.” But mere change of subject, or taking a point of distance and distinction, as remote as possible from the scenes in which her imagination had previously expatiated, does not necessarily imply originality of invention in the const\n",

In the former the drops are so small that they are quite invisible; in the latter, although their size be larger, they seem to have very little more specific gravity than the atmosphere itself, and may therefore be reckoned hollow spherules rather than drops. This subject will be found fully discussed in the articles on Meteobology, Physical Geography, and Weather.\n",
      "Preternatural Rains. We have numerous accounts, in the historians of our own as well as other countries, of preternatural rains; such as the raining of stones, of dust, of blood, nay, even of living animals, as young frogs, and the like. We cannot doubt the truth of what authors of veracity and credit relate to us of this sort, nor can we suppose that the falling of stones and dust never happened; the whole mistake consists in supposing them to have fallen from the clouds. But as to the blood and frogs, it is very certain that they never fell at all, and the opinion to the contrary has been produced by a mere deception of sight. Men are extremely fond of the marvellous in their relations; but the judicious reader must examine strictly whatever is reported of this kind, and not sufi - er himself to be deceived.\n",
      "There are two natural methods by which quantities of stones and of dust may fall in certain places, without their having been generated in the clouds or descended as rain. The one is by means of hurricanes; the wind which we frequently see tearing off the tiles of houses, and carrying them to considerable distances, being equally capable of raising a quantity of stones, and dropping them again at some distant place. But the other, which is much the most powerful, and probably the most usual way, is by the eruptions of volcanoes and burning mountains tossing up, as they frequently do, a vast quantity of stones, ashes, and cinders, to an immense height in the air; and these, being hurried away by the hurricanes and impetuous winds which usually accompany such eruptions, and being in themselves much lighter than common stones, from being half calcined, may thus be easily carried to vast distances, and there falling in places where the inhabitants know nothing of the occasion, cannot but be supposed by the vulgar to fall on them from the clouds. It is well known, that, in the great eruptions of AEtna and Vesuvius, showers of ashes, dust, and small cinders, have been seen to obscure the air, overspread the surface of the sea for a great way, and cover the decks of ships; and this at such a distance, that it might appear scarcely conceivable they should have been carried so far: and probably, if the accounts of all the showers of these substances mentioned by authors were collected, they w ould all be ascertained to have fallen within such distances of volcanoes, whilst, if compared as to the time of their falling, they would be found to correspond in that also with the eruptions of those mountains. We have knowm instances of the ashes from Vesuvius having been carried thirty, nay, forty leagues; and peculiar accidents may have carried them still farther. It is not to be supposed that these showers of stones and dust fall continuously in the manner of showers of rain, or that the fragments or pieces are as frequent as drops of water. It is sufficient that a number of stones, or a quantity of dust, fall at once on a place, where the inhabitants can have no knowledge of the point whence they came, and the vulgar will not doubt their dropping from the clouds. Nay, in the canton of Berne, in Switzerland, the inhabitants accounted it a miracle that it rained earth and sulphur upon them at a time when a small volcano terrified them; and even whilst the wind was so boisterous, and hurricanes so frequent, that they saw almost every moment the dust, sand, and little stones torn up from the surface of the earth in whirlwinds, and carried to a considerable height in the air, they never considered that both the sulphur thrown up by the volcano, and the dust, sand, and stones carried from their feet, must soon afterwards fall somewhere. It is very certain that in some of the terrible storms of hail, where , the hailstones have been several inches in circumference, there have been found, on breaking them, what people called stones in their middle; but these observers need only to wait the dissolving of one of these hailstones, to see the stone in its centre also disunite, it being formed merely of the particles of loose earthy matter, which the water, exhaled by the sun’s heat, had taken up with it in extremely small molecules, and this serving to give an opaque hue to the inner part of the congelation, to which the freezing of the water alone gave the apparent hardness of stone.\n",
      "The raining of blood has ever been accounted a more terrible sight and a more fatal omen than the other preternatural rains already mentioned. It is very certain that nature forms blood nowhere but in the vessels of animals, and therefore showers of it from the clouds are by no means to be credited. Those who suppose that what people took for blood has actually been seen falling through the air, have had recourse for its origin to flying insects, and suppose it to be the eggs or dung of certain butterflies discharged as they were high up in the air. But this seems to be a very wild conjecture, as we know of no butterfly the excrements or eggs of which are of such a colour, or its abode so high in the air, or its flocks so numerous, as to be tile occasion of such a phenomenon.\n",
      "It is most probable that these bloody waters were never seen falling; but that people, seeing the standing waters blood-coloured, were assured, from their not knowing how it should else happen, that it had rained blood into them. A very’ memorable instance of this took place at the Hague in the year 1670. Swammerdam, who relates it, tells us, that one morning the whole town was in an uproar on finding, as they thought, their lakes and ditches full of blood; for these having certainly been full of water the night before, they agreed that it must have rained blood during the night. But a certain physician went down to one of the canals, and taking home a quantity of this blood-coloured water, he examined it by the microscope, and found that the water was water still, and had not at all changed its colour; but that it was full of prodigious swarms of small red animals, all alive, and very nimble in their motions, the colour and prodigious number of which gave a reddish tinge to the whole body of the water in which they lived. The certainty that this was the case, did not however persuade the Hollanders to part with the miracle. They prudently concluded, that the sudden appearance of such a number of animals was as great a prodigy as the raining of blood would have been; and remain assured to this day, that this portent foretold the scene of war and destruction that Louis XIV. afterwards brought into that country, which had previously enjoyed forty years of uninterrupted peace.\n",
      "The animals which thus colour the water of lakes and ponds are the pulices arborescentes of Swammerdam, or the water-fleas with branched horns. These creatures are of a reddish-yellow or flame colour. They live about the sides of ditches, under weeds, and amongst the mud; and are therefore the less visible, except at a certain time, which is in the beginning or end of June. It is at this time that these little animals leave their recesses to float loose about the water, and meet for the propagation of their species; and by this means they become visible in the colour which they give the water. The colour in question is visible, more or less, in one part or other of almost all standing waters at this season; and it is always at the same season that the bloody waters have alarmed the ignorant.\n",
      "The raining of frogs is a thing not less wonderful in the accounts of authors who love the marvellous than those of blood or stones; and this is supposed to happen so frequently, that there are multitudes who pretend to have been eyewitnesses of it. These rains of frogs always happen after very dry seasons, and are much more frequent in the hotter than in the cold countries. In Italy they are very frequent; and it is not uncommon to see the streets of Rome swarming with young frogs and toads in an instant after a shower of rain. Nay, they have been seen to fall through the air down upon the pavements. This seems to be a strong circumstance in favour of their being rained down from the clouds; but, when strictly examined, i t comes to nothing. For these frogs which are seen to fell are always found dead, lamed, or bruised by the fall, and never hop about like the rest; and they are never seen to fall, except close under the walls of houses, from the roofs and gutters of which they have accidentally slipped down. Some people who love to add to things strange others yet stranger, affirm that young frogs have fallen into their hats in the midst of an open field; but this is equally idl e and false.\n",
      "Others, who cannot agree with the opinion of their felling from the clouds, have tried to solve the difficulty of their sudden appearance, by supposing them hatched out of the egg, or spawn, by these rains. Nay, some have supposed them to be made immediately out of the dust. But there are unanswerable arguments against all these suppositions. Equivocal generation, or the spontaneous production of animals out of dust, is now wholly exploded. The fall from the clouds would destroy and kill these tender and soft-bodied animals. And they cannot be at this time hatched immediately out of eggs, because the young frog does not make its appearance from the egg in form, but has its hinder legs enveloped in a skin, and is what we call a tadpole; and the young frogs are at least a hundred times larger at the time of their appearance \n",

      "an eminent scholar and philologist, was born at Brendekild, in the island of Even, in the year 1784. He studied at the university of Copenhagen, and early distinguished himself by his singular talent for the acquisition of languages. In the year 1808, he was appointed assistant keeper of the University Library, and some years afterwards made professor of Literary History. In 1811, he published, in the Danish language, his Introduction to the Grammar ot the Icelandic and other Ancient Northern Languages, the materials of which were entirely derived from the immense mass of manuscript and printed works which had been accumulated by his predecessors in the same field of research. This grammar appears to have given a fresh impulse to the study of the ancient northern languages, even in Germany. The reputation which Rask acquired by it recommended him to the Arna-Magnaean Institution, by which he was employed as editor of the Icelandic Lexicon of Biorne Haldorsen,\n",
      "\n",
      "which had long remained in manuscript To this work, which appeared in 1814, Bishop Miiller contributed a preface, in which he pronounces a just eulogium on the talents and the spirit of research displayed by the youthful editor. About the same time, Rask, who had never been in Iceland, paid a visit to that country, where he remained from 1813 to 1815, during which time he made himself completely master of the language, and familiarized himself with the literature, manners, and customs of the natives. To the interest with which they inspired him, may probably be attributed the establishment at Copenhagen, early in 1816, of the Icelandic Literary Society, which was mainly instituted by his exertions, and of which he had the honour to be the first president.\n",
      "Whilst thus employed, however, he was about to enter upon a more ample field pf enterprise. In October 1816, he left Denmark on a literary expedition, which had been fitted out for the double purpose of prosecuting inquiries into the languages of the East, and collecting manuscripts for the University Library at Copenhagen. The king of Denmark having liberally provided him with the requisite means, he proceeded first to Sweden, where he remained two years, in the course of which he made an excursion into Finland, for the purpose of studying the language of that country. Here he published, in Swedish, his Anglo-Saxon Grammar, in 1817; and during the same year there appeared at Copenhagen, in Danish, an Essay on the Origin of the Ancient Scandinavian or Icelandic Tongue, in which he traced the affinity of that remarkable idiom to the other European languages, particularly to the Latin and the Greek. In 1818, he published a second edition, very much improved, of his Icelandic Grammar, translated by himself into Swedish; and in the course of the same year he also brought out the first complete editions of Snorro’s Edda, and Saemund’s Edda, in the original text, along with Swedish translations of both Ed-das, the originals and the versions occupying each two volumes. From Stockholm he proceeded, in 1819, to St Petersburg, where he wrote in German an interesting paper on the Languages and Litcrature of Norway, Iceland, Sweden, and Finland, which was published in the sixth number of the ViennaJahrbucher. From Russia, which he traversed, he proceeded through Tartary into Persia, and resided for some time at Tauris, Teheran, Persepolis, and Shiraz. It may be mentioned here, as an instance of his remarkable facility in acquiring languages, that, in about six weeks, he made himself sufficiently master of the Persian to be able to converse freely in that language with the natives. In 1820, he embarked at Abuschekr, in the Persian Gulfj for Bombay, which he reached in safety; and during his residence there he wrote, in English, a Dissertation on the Authenticity of the Zend Language, which he addressed to the governor, the Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone, and which was afterwards published in the third volume of the Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay. The same production, with corrections and additions, was afterwards deemed worthy of insertion in the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society. From Bombay he proceeded through India to Ceylon, where he arrived in 1822, and soon afterwards wrote, in English, a Dissertation respecting the best Method of expressing the Sounds of the Indian Languages in European Characters, which was printed in the Transactions of the Literary and Agricultural Society of Colombo. Professor Rask, having at length completed his researches on the scale prescribed, set out for Europe, and reached Copenhagen in the beginning of May 1823, after an absence of nearly seven years. He brought home with him a considerable collection of rare and curious oriental manuscripts, Persian, Zend, Pali, Cingalese, and others, which now enrich the university and royal libraries of the Danish capital.\n",

      "pose. Between the period of his return from the East and that of his death, which occurred far too soon for the interests of philology, Professor Rask published in his native language a Spanish Grammar in 1824, an Italian Grammar and a Frisic Grammar in 1825, a Treatise respecting the Ancient Egyptian Chronology in 1827, the Ancient Jewish Chronology previous to Moses in 1828, and an Essay on Danish Orthography in the same year. He likewise edited an edition of Schneider’s Danish Grammar for the use of Englishmen in 1829, and superintended the English translation of his Anglo-Saxon Grammar in 1830. This last work supplies what had long been a desideratum in English literature. Before its appearance, persons whose taste might dispose them to investigate our early vernacular remains, had no guides to direct them, and each had to form for himself a Grammar and a Dictionary of the Saxon. Hickes’ was full of blunders, and in these Elstob, Lye, Manning, and others had religiously followed him, superadding their own contingents respectively. By the publication of Rask’s Saxon Grammar, however, we were to a certain degree freed from this lamentable state of things, and facilities were affordedfor the acquisition of the language, which previously had no existence. The attentive student will at once perceive the important light which he has thrown upon its principles, by w τ hat he has advanced regarding accentuation, in all which the soundness of his views is fully supported by the manuscripts. He has divided nouns into simple and complex, and adjectives into definite and indefinite; a division which is new to us in this country, and, by its simplicity of arrangement, forms a striking contrast to the endless subdivisions, exceptions, and annotations of Hickes. But it is in the investigation of the verbs that Rask appears to the greatest advantage. His classification of them is simple and obvious; nor can there be a better proof of his accuracy than the perfect order and regularity which it enables us to detect in numerous formations previously considered as irregular. His observations on prefixes and postfixes are written with less care, and he has also treated the important branch of syntax in too slight and perfunctory a manner; omissions which excite some surprise, in a scholar possessing such an entire mastery over the Anglo-Saxon.\n",
      "We must return to the author himself, however, one of whose last literary efforts we have thus incidentally noticed. In private life the character of Professor Rask was such as to command admiration and respect. His manners, though somewhat retiring, were mild and gentle, and his morals unimpeachable. His mode of living was simple in the extreme, and his temperance that of an anchoret. The habits of Study and application which he had acquired in his youth were never laid aside. In company he was diffident, and always expressed himself with modesty; but when the subject involved any thing relative to his own history or pursuits, he evinced a reluctance to converse, which seemed to grow upon him with years, and almost amounted to a morbid sensibility. His facility in the acquisition of languages was extraordinary; he appeared to gain a knowledge of them by a sort of intuition, and his mind seemed to recollect rather than to learn. In 1822, he was master of no less than twenty-five languages and dialects. His knowledge of English was extensive and correct. He spoke and wrote it with such fluency and precision, that Englishmen to whom he was introduced were accustomed to ask him how long he had been in England, considering that such an acquaintance could only be gained by a residence in the country where it was spoken. Risk, in his personal appearance, was thin and spare, but well made; his habits of temperance, regularity, and exercise, had contributed to give him all the appearance of a healthy man, and he seemed destined to attain a ripe old age. He was capable of enduring much fatigue, and even the privation of necessary rest; changes of climate seemed to produce no impression upon his constitution;\n",
      "\n",
      "the scorching sun of India, and the biting frosts of Iceland, were equally braved and disregarded. But, with all this apparent superiority to ordinary infirmities, he fell a victim to consumption, brought on, it is believed, by those habits of intense application, and abstinence from proper nutriment, to which we have already alluded; and he died at that period of life (forty-eight) when the faculties of the human mind have little more than attained their maturity, leaving behind him a name that will not soon be forgotten.\n",
      "The acquirements of Professor Rask were multifarious and extraordinary, and such as justly entitled him to our respect and admiration. There never perhaps existed any scholar whose study of language had been directed to a wider circle, and assuredly none who had made the structure of language so much an object of attention. He was the grea\n",

      "the ingenious authoress of The Old English Baron, was the daughter of the Reverend William Reeve, rector of Freston, and of Kerton, in Suffolk, and perpetual curate of St Nicholas. Her mother’s maiden name was Smitllies, daughter of Mr Smithies, goldsmith and jeweller to George I. The father of Miss Reeve was “an old Whig,” and from him she learned all that she knew; he was her oracle, and used to make her readl the parliamentary debates whilst he smoked his pipe after supper. Under the same paternal tuition, she also read Rapin’s History of England, Cato’s Letters, the Greek and Roman histories, and Plutarch’s Lives, at an age when few people of either sex can read their own names. Mr Reeve, himself one of a family of eight children, had the same number of offspring; and hence it is probable that Clara’s strong natural turn for study, rather than any degree of exclusive care which his partiality could bestow, enabled her to acquire such a stock of early information.\n",
      "After the death of Mr Reeve, his widow resided in Colchester with three of his daughters; and it was here that Clara first became an authoress, by translating from the original Latin Barclay’s fine old romance of Argenis, which was published in 1762, under the title of The Phoenix. It was not, however, until 1767, five years afterwards, that she produced her first and most distinguished work, which was published by Mr Dilly of the Poultry, under the title of The Champion of Virtue. The sum given for the copyright was only ten pounds; but in the following year the work came to a second edition, and was then first called The Old English Baron, for what reason we do not pretend to conjecture. This production is inscribed to Mrs Brigden, the daughter of Richardson, who is stated to have lent some assistance in the revision and correction of the work.\n",
      "The success of The Old English Baron encouraged Miss Reeve to devote more of her leisure hours to literary composition, and accordingly she published in succession, The Two Mentors, The Progress of Romance, The Exile, The School for Widows, Plans of Education, and Memoirs of Sir Roger de Clarendon, a natural son of the Black Prince, with Anecdotes of many other eminent persons of the fourteenth century. To these works there remains to be added another, the interest of which turned upon supernatural appearances. In a preface to a subsequent edition of The Old English Baron, Miss Reeve informs the public that, in compliance with the suggestion of a friend, she had composed Castle Connor, an Irish story, in which apparitions were introduced. But the manuscript being intrusted to some careless or unfaithful person, fell aside, and was never recovered. The various novels produced by this lady are all marked by excellent good sense, pure morality, and a considerable command of those qualities requisite to constitute a good romance. They were, generally speaking, favourably received at the time; but none of them took the same strong possession of the public mind as The Old English Baron, upon which the fame of the author may be considered as now exclusively rested, and by which alone 6he will be known to posterity.\n",
      "Miss Reeve led a retired life, affording no materials for biography, until the beginning of December 1803, when she died at Ipswich, her native city, at the advanced age of seventy-eight years, and was buried in the churchyard of St Stephens, according to her particular direction. Such are the only particulars that have been collected concerning this accomplished and excellent woman; and, in their simplicity, the reader may remark that of her life and her character. The following critical observations, confined entirely to her most celebrated work, which first established her fame, and upon which alone it will in all probability rest, are extracted from the biographical notice of Miss Reeve by Sir Walter Scott, to which we have also been in-* debted for the foregoing particulars of her life.\n",
      "“The authoress has herself informed us that The Old English Baron is the * literary offspring of The Castle of Otranto ;’ and she has obliged us by pointing out the different and more limited view which she had adopted, of the supernatural machinery employed by Horace Walpole. She condemns the latter for the extravagance of several of his conceptions; for the gigantic size of his sword and helmet; and for the violent fictions of a walking picture, and a skeleton in a hermit’s cowl. A ghost, she contends, to be admitted as an ingredient in romance, must behave himself like ghosts of sober demeanour, and subject himself to the common rules still preserved in grange and hall, as circumscribing beings of his description.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must, however, notwithstanding her authority, enter our protest against fettering the realm of shadows by the opinions entertained of it in the world of realities. If we are to try ghosts by the ordinary rules of humanity, we bar them of their privileges entirely. For instance, why admit the existence of an aerial phantom, and deny it the terrible attribute of magnifying its stature? why admit an enchanted helmet, and not a gigantic one? why allow as an impressive incident the fall of a suit of armour, thrown down, we must suppose, by no mortal hand, and at the same time deny the same supernatural influence the power of producing the illusion (for it is only represented as such) upon Manfred, which gives seeming motion and life to the portrait of his ancestor? It may be said, and it seems to be Miss Reeve’s argument, that there is a verge of probability, which even the most violent figment must not transgress; but we reply by the cross question, that if we are once to subject our preternatural agents to the limits of human reason, where are we to stop? We might, under such a rule, demand of ghosts an account of the very circuitous manner in which they are pleased to open their communications with the living world. We might, for example, move a quo warranto against the spectre of the murdered Lord Lovel, for lurking about the eastern apartment, when it might have been reasonably expected, that if he did not at once impeach his murderers to the next magistrate, he might at least have put Fitzowen into the secret, and thus obtained the succession of his son more easily than by the dubious and circuitous route of a single combat. If there should be an appeal against this imputation, founded on the universal practice of ghosts, in such circumstances, who always act with singular obliquity in disclosing the guilt of which they complain, the matter becomes a question of precedent; in which view of the case, we may vindicate Horace Walpole for the gigantic exaggeration of his phantom, by the similar expansion of the terrific vision of Fa-doun, in Blind Harry’s Life of Wallace; and we could, were we so disposed, have paralleled his moving picture, by the example of one with which we ourselves had some acquaintance, which was said both to move and to utter groans, to the great alarm of a family of the highest respectability.\n",
      "“Where, then, may the reader ask, is the line to be drawn? or what are the limits to be placed to the reader’s credulity, when those of common sense and ordinary nature are once extended? The question admits only one answer, namely, that the author himself, being in fact the magician, shall evoke no spirits whom he is not capable of endowing with manners and language corresponding to their supernatural character. Thus Shakspeare, drawing such characters as Caliban and Ariel, gave them reality, not by appealing to actual opinions, which his audience might entertain respecting the possibility or impossibility of their existence, but by investing them with such attributes as all readers and spectators recognised as those which must have corresponded to such extraordinary beings, had their existence been possible. If he had pleased to put into language the ‘ squeaking and gibbering* of those disembodied phantoms which haunted the streets of Rome, no doubt his wonderful imagination could have filled up the sketch which, marked by these two emphatic and singularly felicitous expressions, he has left as characteristic of the language of the dead.\n",
      "“In this point of view, our authoress has, with equal judgment and accuracy, confined her flight within those limits on which her pinions could support her; and though we are disposed to contest her general principle, we are willing to admit it as a wise and prudent one, so far as applied to regulate her own composition. In no part of The Old English Baron, or of any other of her works, does Miss Reeve show the possession of a rich or powerful imagination. Her dialogue is sensible, easy, and agreeable, but neither marked by high flights of fancy nor strong bursts of passion. Her apparition is an ordinary fiction, of which popular superstition used to furnish a thousand instances, when nights were long, and a family, assembled round a Christmas log, had little better to do than to listen to such tales. Miss Reeve has been very felicitously cautious in showing us no more of Lord Lovel’s ghost than she needs must; he is a silent apparition, palpable to the sight only, and never brought forward into such broad daylight as might have dissolved our reverence. And so far, we repeat, the authoress has used her own power to the utmost advantage, and gained her point by not attempting a step beyond it. But we cannot allow that the rule which, in her own case, has been well and wisely adopted, ought to circumscribe a bolder and more imaginative writer.\n",
      "“In what may be called the costume, or keeping, of the chivalrous period in which tile scene of both is laid, the language and style of Horace Walpole, together with his intimate acquaintance with the manners of the middle ages, form an incalculable difference betwixt The Castle of Otranto and The Old English Baron.

      "a distinguished philosopher, and in some measure the founder of a school, was the son of Lewis Reid, minister of the parish of Strachan, in the county of Kincardine, Scotland. His mother, the daughter of Mr Gregory of Kinnairdie, in Banffshire, was one of twenty-nine children, and sister to David, James, and Charles Gregory, who were at the same period professors of astronomy or mathematics in the universities of Oxford, Edinburgh, and St Andrews.\n",
      "Dr Reid was born at the parsonage-house of Strachan in April 1710, and received the elementary parts of his education at the parish-school of Kincardine O’Neil. The parochial schools of Scotland are said to have been much superior at that period to what they are at present, and young men went from them well furnished with philological learning to the different universities. The early progress of young Reid must have been very extraordinary,\n",
      "VOL. xιx.\n",
      "since he was qualified to profit by the lectures of the professors at the age of twelve. He soon gave very striking' proofs that he inherited the genius of his mother’s family, and was conspicuous amongst the students of mathematics, in a college where that science has always been cultivated with zeal and success. He continued longer at the university than the usual term of years, having been appointed to the office of librarian, a situation which was every way agreeable to him, as it gave him ample opportunities of gratifying his passion for study. About this time he became intimately attached to John Stewart, afterwards professor of mathematics in Marischal College, a connection which greatly strengthened his predilection for mathematical studies.\n",
      "He resigned the office of librarian in the year 1736, and accompanied Mr Stewart to England, when they paid a visit to London, Oxford, and Cambridge, and were introduced to several persons of the first literary distinction. On account of his relation to Dr David Gregory, he had ready access to the celebrated Martin Folkes, whose house might be said to contain many of the most interesting objects to be met with in the metropolis. He saw Dr Bentley at Cambridge, with whose erudition he was much delighted, as well as amused with his vanity; and he also conversed frequently with Saunderson, the blind mathematician. Dr Reid in his philosophical speculations refers to this gentleman’s blindness, as a singular phenomenon in the history of the human mind.\n",
      "Dr Reid maintained an uninterrupted friendship with the learned and amiable Mr Stewart until the year 1766, at which time the latter was carried off by a malignant fever. The circumstances attending the death of this excellent man deeply wounded the sensibility of Dr Reid; for his wife and daughter were carried ofl' by the same disorder, and buried with him in the same grave.\n",
      "The King’s College of Aberdeen presented Dr Reid to the living of New Machar in the year 1737; but such was the zeal of the people against the law of patronage at that time, that he not only met with violent opposition, but was also exposed to personal danger. But his attention to the duties of his office was so exemplary, his temper so mild and forbearing, and his spirit of humanity so active, that in a short time he subdued their prejudices; and when at last called in the course of Providence to a different situation, the very people who had been guilty of gross and indecent outrages against him followed him, on his departure, with their benedictions and tears.\n",
      "In the year 1740, he married Elizabeth, daughter of his uncle, Dr George Reid, physician in London, after which his popularity at New Machar very much increased. Her manners were so accommodating, and so numerous were her kind offices to the sick and the indigent, that the departure of the family from the neighbourhood was looked upon as a general misfortune. The manner in which several old men were accustomed to speak upon the subject is worthy of being kept in remembrance. “We fought,” said they, “against Dr Reid when he came, and we would have fought for him when he went away.”\n",
      "The greater part of his time during his residence at New Machar was devoted to the most intense study, particularly directing his attention to the laws of external perception, and of the other principles which constitute the basis of human knowledge. He unbended his mind by the amusements of gardening and botany, of which he was extremely fond, even in old age.\n",
      "The professors of King’s College, in the year 1752, made choice of Dr Reid to be professor of philosophy, originating wholly from the high opinion they were led to entertain of his talents and erudition. We are not acquainted with the particular plan which he adopted and pursued in the course of his lectures; but his department at that period comprehended mathematics and physic, logic and o ethics; a practice then followed in the other universities of Scotland, instead of appointing a professor for each distinct branch.\n",
      "Dr Reid had not been long in Aberdeen, till, in conjunction with Dr John Gregorj', he projected a literarj’ society, which continued for a number of years, and met once a week. The writings of Reid, Gregory, Campbell, Beattie, and Gerard, evince the numerous advantages which the members derived from this institution, as they were in the habit of subjecting such works as they intended for publication, to the test of friendly criticism.\n",
      "It is perhaps not too much to assert, that of all the publications which appeared about this time, the Inquiry into the Human Mind by Dr Reid discovered by far the greatest originality and profound thinking. It appears that he had conceived the plan, and deeply meditated upon it, long before its publication; yet, without the applause of his literary associates, it is more than probable that his native modesty would have prevented him from giving it to the world.\n",
      "The publication of Mr Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature, in 1739, lcd him to question the principles commonly received with regard to the human understanding. He admitted, when a youth, but without any attentive examination, the opinions on which Mr Hume’s scepticism was raised; but when he carefully adverted to the consequences which these principles appeared to involve, he instantly began to suspect their truth. To subvert the sceptical theory of Mr Hume was the grand object of Dr Reid’s Inquiry, which he submitted to the examination of Mr Hume himself. That philosopher, even after he had seen some parts of the work, discovers not a little of the Jewish spirit of unbelief that any good thing should come out of Nazareth; and considering his antagonist as a clergyman, and belonging to an order of men from whom prejudice would not allow him to expect any soundness of reasoning in matters of science, he betrays more than want of good humour, as Dr Reid’s biographer expresses himself, when he says, in no very courteous language, in a letter to Dr Blair, “I wish that the parsons would confine themselves to their old occupation of worrying one another, and leave philosophers to argue with temper, moderation, and good manners.” But though Mr Hume, as appears from the words just quoted, was very angry that a clergyman should become a philosopher, on a second perusal of the Inquiry, he seems to have held very different sentiments, when he wrote to the author himself in the following terms. “By Dr Butler’s means, I have been favoured with the perusal of your performance, which I have read with great pleasure and attention. It is certainly very rare, that a piece so deeply philosophical is wrote [written] with so much spirit, and affords so much entertainment to the reader; though I must still regret the disadvantages under which I read it, as I never had the whole performance at once before me, and could not be able fidly to compare one part with another. To this reason, chiefly, I ascribe some obscurities, which, in spite of your short analysis or abstract, still seem to hang over your system. For I must do you the justice to own, that when I entered into your ideas, no man appears to ex-\n",
      "i>ress himself with greater perspicuity than you do; a ta-ent which, above all others, is requisite in that species of literature which you have cultivated....As I was desirous to be of some use to you, I kept a watchful eye all along over your style; but it is really so correct, and so good English, that I found not any thing worth the remarking. There is only one passage in this chapter, where you make use of the phrase hinder to do instead of hinder from doing, which is the English one; but I could not find the passage when I sought for it. You may judge how unexceptionable the whole appeared to me, when I could remark so small a blemish.”\n",
      "The impression made on the minds of speculative men by the publication of Dr Reid’s Inquiry was as great as could reasonably be expected from the nature of his undertaking. It was not level to the comprehension of the multitude, nor even addressed to them; and as it examined opinions with the utmost freedom which had obtained the sanction of the highest authorities, it had little prospect of conciliating the favour of the learned. Some, however, there were, who perceived the extent of his views, and beheld in his pages the true spirit and language of inductive investigation, which made proselytes of many, who, again, warmly recommended the work to the attention of others. The Inquiry of Dr Reid was so much esteemed by the learned body of teachers then in the University of Glasgow, that they gave him an invitation to the vacant professorship of moral philosophy in the year 1763. It was no doubt with a considerable degree of reluctance that he resolved to leave Aberdeen; yet so numerous were the allurements which Glasgow presented to a man of his extensive erudition and deep research, that he gave it the preference. That seminary of learning could then boast of a Moor, a Simpson, a Black, a Leechman, the two Wilsons, father and son, and the acute, discr\n",

      "acounty in Scotland, lying between 55. 40. 40. and 55. 58.10. north latitude, and 4.15. and 4. 52. 30. west longitude, is bounded on the east by Lanarkshire, on the south by Ayrshire, and on the north and w r est by the river and frith of Clyde, which separate it from the shires of Dumbarton and Argyle, excepting a section of about 1300 imperial acres, which is situatctl on the north bank of the Clyde, opposite the town of Renfrew. Its greatest length is thirty-one miles and a half, and its greatest breadth thirteen miles and a fourth. Its area is 241 square miles, or 154,240 acres, of which about 100,000 are cultivated, 20,000 uncultivated, and 34,240 unprofitable. Notwithstanding the small extent of this shire, its manufactures and commerce render it one of the most important in Scotland.\n",
      "At the epoch of the Roman invasion, in the first century of the Christian era, this part of Scotland was inhabited by a Celtic tribe, called by the invaders the Damnii. After the withdrawal of the Romans, it w r as comprehended in the British kingdom of Stratlldyde.\n",
      "The district which now forms the county of Renfrew, at least the greater part of it, was denominated, from one of its rivers, Strathgryfe, the valley of the Gryfe, and at one time formed part of the shire of Lanark or Clydesdale. It was the chief patrimony of the great stewards of Scotland, to whom it was granted by the sovereign in the twelfth century. Afterwards it was called the barony of Renfrew’, from the burgh of that name, where the stewards long had their principal residence. In 1404, thirty-three years after the accession of the house of Stewart to the Scottish throne, King Robert III. granted this barony, and the other portions of the estates of the steward, to his son and heir James; since which time the eldest son of the sovereign has, besides his other titles, bome that of “Baron of Renfrew.” Soon afterwards this barony was erected into a distinct sheriffdom, the courts of which were held at Renfrew till the year 1705, when they were, for convenience sake, removed to Paisley. In 1815 the county was formed into two wards, termed the Upper and the Lower, with a sheriff-substitute for each, Paisley and Greenock being the seats of their respective courts.\n",
      "Renfrew shire comprehends twenty-one parishes, besides small portions of those of Beith and Dunlop in Ayrshire, and Govan in Lanarkshire. Two of the parishes, Eagle-sham and Cathcart, belong to the presbytery of Glasgow; the other nineteen composed the presbytery of Paisley for a long time prior to the year 1834, when two presbyteries w , ere formed; that of Paisley, consisting of twelve of these nineteen parishes; and that of Greenock, consisting of the other seven, with the addition of Cumbraes in Buteshire, and Largs in Ayrshire, both of which parishes formerly belonged to the presbytery of Irvine. In the above enumeration of parishes, those which are so quoad sacra only have not been taken into account.\n",
      "About two thirds of this county, comprehending the western and southern sides, are hilly, the medium elevation being from 500 to 600 feet. MistyIaw, on the west, which is about 1240 feet above the level of the sea, has been represented as the highest hill in the county; but it is now ascertained that a neighbouring height, called the Hill of Staik, is entitled to that distinction, being a few feet higher. This last was one of the points of observation in the general trigonometrical survey of the kingdom. Balagiech and Dun-wan are the highest hills on the south-east side, being about 1000 feet above the sea-level. The hilly district is in general kept in pasture, for which it is better adapted, by the nature of its surface, than for tillage; though, as it has a free light soil, which readily absorbs water, it is seldom injured by moisture. The cultivated land, which forms the gently-rising district, lies on the north and north-east, and in the centre of the county on both sides of the Black CarL Of this the greater part consists of low, detached eminences, which swell in endless variety. These being interspersed with copses, and often watered at the bottom by winding streams, present views remarkable for richness and variety. Indeed it will be difficult to point to a more beautiful surface anywhere in Scotland. Much of this tract has a close subsoil of small stones and coarse clay, almost impenetrable to water, though there are here many flat holms of great fertility. It is only between Paisley and the Clyde that the country sinks down into a plain, forming the flat district known by the name of “the Laighlands.” The length of this beautiful level tract is about six miles, its breadth about three, and its area 12,000 acres. Here the soil is generally a deep rich loam of a dark-brown colour, sometimes of the nature of what is called “carse clay ;” and much of it seems to have been formed by the deposition of vegetable mould from the higher grounds. Moss prevails in the first and last divisions, but is not found in the second one, where the soil is pretty uniform.\n",
      "Like the other western counties of Scotland, Renfrewshire has a moist climate, with frequent rains; and the prevailing wind is from the south-west. At Largs, a village in Ayrshire, near the western extremity of this county, the yearly quantity of rain in 1809 and 1810 was 38U inches; at Glasgow, near the eastern extremity, for thirty years, from 1761 to 1790, it was 29∙65 inches.\n",
      "Besides the Clyde, which, as has been already mentioned, flows along the northern and western boundaries of this county, the principal rivers are the White Cart, the Black Cart, and the Gryfe. The White Cart, which rises in Lanarkshire, enters Renfrewshire from the south, and pursues a winding course, first westerly towards Paisley, through which it passes, and then northerly towards the Clyde. It is joined at Inchinnan Bridge by the Black Cart, which had previously received the waters of the Gryfe at Walkinshaw, above Barnsford Bridge; and these united streams, which contain nine tenths of the water of the county, fall into the Clyde about three miles below Paisley. By means of a short canal, which was cut to avoid the shallows at Inchinnan Bridge in 1786, the White Cart is navigable up to Paisley. Other improvements upon this river are in progress. Like some other Scottish streams, it was once famous for the pearls which were found in its bed, but these have disappeared since the beginning of the eighteenth century. The\n",
      "Black Cart rises from Loch Winnoch, or, as it is usually called, from an adjoining estate, Castle-Semple Loch, a lake in the south-western extremity of the county. The Gryfe rises in the west, amongst the high lands of the parish of Greenock. All these streams, and several others of smaller size, independently of their importance to agriculture, are, in almost every part of their course, applied by the industrious and ingenious inhabitants to the various purposes of manufactures. A ready supply of water is secured by means of reservoirs, some of which are of the size and appearance of considerable lakes; or by enlarging the natural lakes themselves, of which there are many. These streams and lakes contain the kinds of fish that are common in this quarter of the country.\n",
      "Two railways, which will traverse the county, are now (March 1839) in course of being formed. Commencing at Glasgow, they will have a common line to Paisley, from which the one will lead north-westwards to Greenock, and the other westwards to several places in Ayrshire. These ways oftransport must prove Ofincalculable value to the trade and commerce of the county. It is expected that they will be opened in 1840. The Paisley and Renfrew railway, and the canal from Glasgow to Johnston, have been noticed in the account of Paisley.\n",
      "The minerals of Renfrewshire are of great importance, and constitute the main source of its manufactures and commerce; but we can only advert to them very generally. Coal, limestone, and sandstone, are wrought at Neilston, one of the parishes of the hilly district; and both coal and lime have been found in the flat district near Renfrew; but it is in the middle division that mines are wrought to the greatest extenL Of coal there are generally about twelve different works carried on, of which the most extensive and valuable are at Polmadie, on the north-east boundary; at Hurlet, three miles south-east from Paisley, where it has been wrought for more than three hundred years; and at Quarrelton, south-east from Johnston, on the Black Cart, near the centre of the county. The coal at this latter place consists of five contiguous strata; the thickness of the whole, measured at right angles to their surface, is upwards of fifty feet; but as in some places the seam forms a considerable angle with the horizon, the thickness of the whole in these places, measured vertically, is about fifteen fathoms. In consequence of this great depth, it is wrought in floors or stories. Limestone abounds in various parts, and is commonly wrought at eight different quarries. Ironstone in beds and balls is found in great profusion. Considerable quantities of pyrites are found in the stratum of coal at Hurlet and Househill, and manufactured into sulphate of iron or green vitriol. Alum is obtained at Hurlet, from the decomposed schistus which forms one of the strata of its coal-mines. Excellent freestone, lying near the surface, is wrought at various places in the middle district. Greenstone, or, as it is provincially called, whinstone, exists in immense masses. ^[1. Much valuable and interesting information on the geology of Renfrewshire will be found in an essay by Mr William Montgomery, younger of Cloak, factor, Castle-Semple, inserted amongst the Prize Essays and Transactions of the Highland and AgriculturalSociety of Scotland for December 1838, p. 421. ]\n",
      "The annual value of real property in Renfrewshire, as assessed in 1815, was L.265,534 sterling. The valued rent in 1674 was L.69,17\n",

      "the celebrated painter, was born at Plympton, a small town in Devonshire, on the 16th July 1723. His father was minister of the parish, and also master of the grammar school; and being a man of learning and philanthropy, he was beloved and respected by all to whom he was known. Such a man, it will naturally be supposed, was assiduous in the cultivation of the minds of his children, amongst whom his son Joshua shone conspicuous, by displaying at a very early period a superiority of genius and the rudiments of a correct taste. Unlike other boys, who generally content themselves with giving a literal explanation of their author, regardless of his beauties or his faults, young Reynolds attended to both these, displaying a happy knowledge of what he read, and entering with ardour into the spirit of his author. He discovered likewise talents for composition, and a natural propensity for drawing, in which his friends and intimates thought him qualified to excel. Emulation was a distinguishing feature in his mind, which his father perceived with the delight natural to a parent; and designing him for the church, in which he hoped that his talents might raise him to eminence, he sent him to one of the universities.\n",
      "Soon after this period he grew passionately fond of painting; and, by the perusal of Richardson’s theory of that art was determined to make it his profession through'life. At his own earnest request therefore, he was removed to London; and about the year 1742 became a pupil to Mr Hudson, who, though not himself an eminent painter, was preceptor to several who afterwards excelled in the art. One of the first advices which he gave to Mr Reynolds was to copy carefully Guercino’s drawings. This was done with such skill, that many of the copies are said to be now preserved in the cabinets of the curious as the originals of that very great master.\n",
      "About the year 1749, Mr Reynolds went to Italy under the auspices and in the company of Lord, then Commodore, Keppel, who was appointed to the command of the British squadron in the Mediterranean. In this garden of the world, this magical seat of the arts, he failed not to visit the schools of the great masters, to study the productions of different ages, and to contemplate with unwearied attention the various beauties which are characteristic of each. His labour here, as has been observed of another painter, was “the labour of love, not the task of the hireling ;” and how much he profited by it is known to all Europe.\n",
      "Having remained about two years in Italy, and studied the language as well as the arts of the country with great success, he returned to England, improved by travel and refined by education. On the road to London from the port where he landed, he accidentally found in the inn where he lodged Johnson’s life of Savage; and was so taken with the charms of composition and the masterly delineation of character displayed in that performance, that having begun to read it whilst leaning with his arm on the chimney-piece, he continued in that attitude insensible of pain till he was hardly able to raise his hand to his head. The admiration of the work naturally led him to seek the acquaintance of its author, who continued one of his most sincere admirers and warmest friends till 1784, when they were separated by the stroke of death.\n",
      "The first thing that distinguished him after his return to his native country, was a full-length portrait of Commodore Keppel; which in the polite circles was spoken of in terms of the highest encomium, and testified to what a degree of eminence he had arrived in his profession. This was followed by a portrait of Lord Edgecumbe, and a few others, which at once introduced him to the first business in portrait-painting; and that branch of the art he cultivated with such success as will for ever establish his fame with all descriptions of refined society. Having painted some of the first-rate beauties of the age, the polite world flocked to see the graces and the charms of his pencil; and he soon became the most fashionable painter, not only in England, but in all Europe. He has indeed preserved the resemblance of so many illustrious characters, that we feel the less regret for his having left behind him so few historical paintings; though what he has done in that way shows him to have been qualified to excel in both departments. ^[1. As the lovers of painting may wish to have a catalogue of this great master’s historical pieces, we subjoin the following :—Hope nursing Love; Venus chastising Cupid for having learned to cast accounts; Count Ugolino in the Dungeon; the Calling of Samuel; Ariadne; a Captain of Banditti; Beggar Boy; a Lady in the character of St Agnes; Thais; Dionysius the Areopagite; an infant Jupiter; Master Crewe in the character of Henry VIII.; the Death of Dido; a Child asleep; Cupid sleeping; Covent Garden Cupid; Cupid in the Clouds; Cupids painting; Boy laughing; Master Herbert in the character of Bacchus; Hebe; Miss Meyer In the character of Hebe; Madona, a head; the Blackguard Mercury; a little Boy (Samuel) praying; an old Man reading; Love loosing the zone of Beauty; the Children in the Wood; Cleopatra dissolving the Pearl; Garrick in the character of Kitely; Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy; Mrs Abingdon in the character of Comedy; a Child surrounded by Guardian Angels; Miss Beau-clerc in the character of Spenser’s Una; Resignation; the Duchess of Manchester in the character of Diana; Lady Blake in the character of Juno; Mrs Sheridan in the character of St Cecilia; Edwin, from Beattie's Minstrel; the Nativity, Four Cardinal Virtues, and Faitli, Hope, and Charity,for the window of New College Chapel, Oxford; the Studious Boy; a Bacchante; a daughter of Lord W. Gordon as an Angel; the Holy Family; the Cottagers, from Thomson; the Vestal; the Careful Shepherdess; a Gipsy telling Fortunes; the infant Hercules strangling the Serpent; the Mouse-trap Girl; Venus; Cornelia and her Children; the Bird; Melancholy; Mrs Siddons in Tragedy; Head of Lear; Mrs Talmash in the character of Miranda, with Prospero and Caliban; Robin Goodfellow; Death of Cardinal Beaufort; Macbeth, with the CaIdron of the Witches. ] The only landscape, perhaps, which he ever painted, except those beautiful and chaste ones which compose the back grounds of many of his portraits, is a View on the Thames from Richmond, which in 1784 was exhibited by the Society for Promoting Painting and Design in Liverpool.\n",
      "In 1764 Mr Reynolds had the merit of being the first promoter of that club which, having long existed without a name, became at last distinguished by the appellation of the Literary Club. Upon the foundation of the Royal Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, he was appointed president; and his acknowledged excellence in his profession made the appointment acceptable to all the lovers of art. To add to the dignity of this new institution, his majesty conferred on the president the honour of knighthood; and Sir Joshua delivered his first discourse at the opening of the academy on the 2d of January 1769. The merit of that discourse has been universally admitted among painters; but it contains some directions respecting the proper mode of prosecuting their studies, to which every student of every art would do well to pay attention. “I would chiefly recommend,” says he, “that an implicit obedience to the rules of art, as established by the practice of the great masters, should be exacted from the young students. That those models which have passed through the approbation of ages should be considered by them as perfect and infallible guides; as subjects for their imitation, not their criticism. I am confident, that this is the only efficacious method of making a progress in the arts; and that he who sets out with doubting, will find life finished before he becomes master of the rudiments. For it may be laid down as a maxim, that he who begins by presuming on his own sense, has ended his studies as soon as he has commenced them. Every opportunity, therefore, should be taken to discountenance that false and vulgar opinion, that rules are the fetters of genius. They are fetters only to men of no genius; as that armour which, upon the strong, becomes an ornament and a defence, upon the weak and mishapen turns into a load, and cripples the body which it was made to protect.”\n",
      "Each succeeding year, on the distribution of the prizes, Sir Joshua delivered to the students a discourse of equal merit with this: and perhaps we do not hazard too much when we say, that, from the whole collected, the lover of belles lettres and the fine arts will acquire juster notions of what is meant by taste in general, and better rules for acquiring a correct taste, than from multitudes of those volumes which have been professedly written on the subject.\n",
      "In the autumn of 1785 he went to Brussels, where he expended about L.1000 on the purchase of paintings, which, having been taken from the different monasteries and religious houses in Flanders and Germany, were then exposed to sale by the command of the Emperor Joseph. Gainsborough and he had engaged to paint each other’s portrait; and the canvass for both being actually stretched, Sir Joshua gave one sitting to his distinguished rival; but, to the regret of every admirer of the art, the unexpected death of the latter prevented all further progress.\n",
      "In 1790 he was anxiously desirous to procure the vacant professorship of perspective in the academy for Mr Bononi, an Italian architect; but that artist no* having been yet elected an associate, was of course no academician, and it became necessary to raise him to these situations, in order to qualify him for being a professor. Mr Gilpin being his competitor for the associateship, the numbers on the ballot proved equal, when the president by his casting vote decided the election in favour of his friend, who was thereby advanced so far towards the professorship. Soon after this,\n",

      "one of the United States of North America, is bounded on the north and east by Massachusetts, on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by Connecticut. It is forty-nine miles in length by twenty-nine in breadth, and contains an area of one thousand three hundred and fifty square miles, which lie between 4L 22. and 42. 3. of north latitude, and longitude 71. 6. and 71. 38. west from Greenwich. This portion of country includes what was formerly known by the name of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, originally constituting two plantations or provinces. Compared with its limited extent, Rhode Island is a very diversified state. In the north-west part the country is hilly and broken, but it becomes gradually level towards the Atlantic Ocean. The state may be divided into three natural sections: the first, constituting four fifths of the whole, is a pretty hilly parallelogram, lying west from Narragansett Bay; the second consists of the delightful islands of Narragansett Bay; and the third section is a small irregular slip lying along Massachusetts, and east from Narragansett This bay extends from north to south through nearly the whole length of the state, and embosoms a number of islands, of which the most important are Rhode Island, Connecticut, Prudence, Patience, Hope, Dyer’s, and Hog Islands. Block Island, in the Atlantic, lying south of the state, is the most southerly land belonging to it. These islands, and the country bordering on the bay, are of great fertility, and are celebrated for their fine cattle, their numerous flocks of sheep, and the abundance and excellence of their butter and cheese. The state generally is better adapted to grazing than tillage. A large portion of the western and northwestern part of it has a thin and lean soil, which affords small crops of New England productions. Cider is made for exportation. Corn, rye, barley, oats, and in some places wheat, are produced in quantities sufficient for home consumption; and the various kinds of grasses, fruits, culinary roots and plants, are in great abundance and perfection. In some parts iron is found in large quantities; copper is also met with; and the state abounds in limestone, particularly the county of Providence. Anthracite coal is wrought on the island which gives name to the state, but itis not held in high estimation. There are several rivers in this state, but their courses are short: the principal are called Pawtucket, Providence, Pawtuxet, Pawcatuc, and Wood Rivers. These, and also the bays, swarm with many varieties of excellent fish. The climate is as salubrious as that of any other part of America, and more temperate than that of the other New England states, particularly on the islands where the ocean breezes have the usual effect of tempering the heat of summer and moderating the cold of winter.\n",
      "The island called Rhode Island, situated in the bay of Narragansett, and which gives name to the state, is about fifteen miles in length from north to south, and three and a half in breadth. It is divided into three townshlps, Newport, Portsmouth, and Middletown. This island is highly celebrated for its salubrity, and here numbers of invalids resort from southern climates. It is also of great fertility, and noted for its breeds of sheep, neat cattle, and horses. The whole is under high cultivation, and in some months of the year presents so delightful an appearance as to have obtained for it the name of the Eden of America. Long. 71. 20. W. Lat 4L 25. N.\n",
      "In no state in the Union is so large a proportion of the population and capital employed in manufactures as in Rhode Island. The principal article is cotton goods, for the manufacture of which there are above one hundred mills, many of them extensive establishments. For the year ending September 1836, there were eighty sets of machinery in operation for the manufacture of other kinds of goods, including broad cloths, satinets, jeans, linseys, and the like. The quantity of wool produced was 265,261 pounds, valued at 133,957 dollars. Iron, ardent spirits, and some other articles, are likewise amongst the manufactures of Rhode Island. The exports consist chiefly of flax-seed, lumber, horses, cattle, beef, pork, fish, poultry, and cotton and linen goods. For the year ending September 1836, the exports of domestic produce were to the amount of 212,297 dollars, and of foreign produce 16,123 dollars; the total value of exports being 228,420 dollars, which appears to be considerably less than in some previous years. The value of the imports for the same period was 555,199 dollars. The amount of shipping of this state may be reckoned at about fifty thousand tons; but so rapidly have commerce and manufactures extended, that a period of only a couple of years is sufficient to produce an increase in these branches of industry which could not have been looked for in such a limited space of time. In 1837 the banks were sixty-two in number, having specie to the amount of 243,482 dollars, a circulation of 1,864,132 dollars, and a capital of 9,837,171 dollars.\n",
      "Amongst the institutions of Rhode Island is Brown University, at Providence, a flourishing seminary. Academies are established in all the principal towns, and the state pays ten thousand dollars per annum for the support of free schools. The most numerous religious sect is that of the Baptists, who have about eighteen churches. There are, besides, the usual religious diversities which characterise a North American state, including many Friends.\n",
      "Among the public works of this state may be mentioned the New York, Providence, and Boston Railway, extending from Stonington in Connecticut to Providence in Rhode Island. About forty miles of it lie in the latter state. It is connected with another railroad, and forms part of a line from Boston to New York. Other works of the kind are in progress.\n",
      "The population of Rhode Island in 1839 may be estimated as amounting to at least 125,000. The capital of the state is Providence, an account of which will be found under that head.\n",

      "Newport, which shares metropolitan honours with the capital, being the seat of government every alternate session, is beautifully situated on the south-west end of the island of Rhode Island, five miles from the sea, and in latitude 4L 29. north, and longitude 71. 21. west. The town lies north and south, upon a gradual ascent east from the water, and exhibits a beautiful view from the harbour and the neighbouring hills. The principal street is more than a mile in length. The harbour, which spreads westward in front of the town, is one of the finest in the world, and spacious enough to allow a large fleet to anchor and ride in perfect security. The entrance is safe and easy, and it is defended by three strong forts. Newport contains a state-house, a jail, several banks and insurance offices, a valuable public library, and houses of worship for most of the religious denominations that are found in New England. A very elegant building is appropriated to the library. This town is famous for the salubrity of its climate, and more noted than any other American town for the variety and excellence of its fresh fish. Newport was first settled in 1636, and before the American revolution had attained to considerable commercial importance. During that war it suffered severely, being for a long time occupied by the British. It maintains some trade with the East Indies, Europe, and Cuba; but the most important branch of its commerce is the coasting trade with the middle and southern states. Its fisheries are very valuable. The population of Newport in 1839 may be estimated at about 10,000.\n",
      "Pawtucket is a flourishing town, partly situated in that part of this state called North Providence, partly in Massachusetts. It is noted for the number and extent of its manufactories, which are situated near a fine cascade on the river Pawtucket. This town contains several public buildings, two or three banks, more than twelve cotton factories, and as many others of different kinds. This is reckoned one of the most flourishing manufacturing villages in the United States. The population may be about 5000. Bristol is a neat commercial town, situated on the east side of Narragansett Bay. It has a safe and commodious harbour, owns a good deal of shipping, and is a place of considerable trade. The population at present ( 1839) may be about 4000. Warren, South Kingston, East Greenwich, Smithfield, Portsmouth, and Warwick, are the only other places of any note. The last-named town contains above 6000 inhabitants.\n",
      "The settlement of this state was commenced at Providence in the year 1636, by Roger Williams, a person of some celebrity in the annals of America. He was banished from Massachusetts on account of the religious doctrines which he preached. Two years afterwards the settlement of the island of Rhode Island was begun. In 1643 Williams went to England, and in the following year obtained a charter by which Rhode Island and Providence Plantations were united under one government. This writ continued in force till 1663, when a new charter was granted by Charles II., and this document has ever since formed the basis of the government. This state is the only one in the Union which is without a written constitution, according to the American form of these things. The legislative power is vested in a general assembly, consisting of a senate and a house of representatives. The latter consists of seventy-two members, six from Newport, four from each of the towns of Providence, Portsmouth, and Warwick, and two from each of the other towns in the state. They are elected semi-annually in April and August. The senate consists of ten members, who are elected annually in April. The executive power is vested in a governor; and a lieutenant-governor is elected along with him, on whom the duties of the executive devolve in case of the office of governor bein\n",

      "in addition to its fine climate, is blessed with a fertile soil, and produces a variety of the finest fruits and vegetables; and if the industry of the inhabitants corresponded to their natural advantages, it might possess all the materials of wealth and commerce. But they have long groaned under the iron rod of Turkish oppression, by which those happy abodes are now converted into scenes of devastation. “The gardens,” says Dr Clarke, ^[1. Travels in Europe and Asia, chap. viii. ] “are filled with delicious fruit. Here, as in Cos, every gale is scented with the most powerful fragrance, which is wafted from groves of orange and citron trees. Numberless aromatic herbs exhale at the same time such profuse odour that the whole atmosphere seems impregnated with a spicy perfume.” A single river, named Candura, which name it gives to the cape in whose vicinity it discharges itself into the sea, waters the interior of the island; but numerous smaller streams and rivulets, which take their rise from the shady summit of Mount Artemira, water the surrounding plains and valleys. The inhabitants have a great taste for gardens; and around the villages are several cultivated fields and orchards, containing fig, pomegranate, and orange trees. The peach-tree, which is said by Pliny to have produced no fruit in his time, is now more fruitful; but the fruit is deficient in flavour, from the inhabitants not knowing the art of ingrafting trees. The palm-tree is as flourishing as in ancient times. In the uncultivated valleys which abound throughout the island, wild roses hang around the foot of the rocks; beds of flowing myrrh perfume the air; laurel roses adorn the banks of the rivulets with their gaudy flowers; and the fertile soil is besides covered with a profusion of weeds and useless plants. Fine trees formerly crowned the highest mountains, the resin from which supplied abundantly the wants of the navy; but they have been generally cut down by the Turks. On the sloping hills fig-trees, carob-trees, and others both useful and agreeable, still grow abundantly: the vine also holds its place, and produces a species of wine which was highly valued by the ancients, and is still extolled on account of its delicacy and perfume. The valleys afford rich pastures, and the plains produce every species of grain: the wheat is of an excellent quality, the ear weighty, and filled with the finest grain, as white as snow, and which makes excellent bread; and, but for the extortions of its barbarian rulers, the island might be the seat of agriculture, as well as commerce, and might export large quantities of corn. But the Turks are lazy and ignorant, and the Greeks are loaded with corvées; and, being further discouraged by the fear of being robbed of the produce of their labours, leave these rich plains unimproved.\n",
      "There are two cities in the island, namely, Rhodes, the capital, which is inhabited chiefly by Turks, with a small proportion of Jews; and the ancient Lindus, which is now reduced to a hamlet, situated on the east side of the island, nearly in the centre. It is entirely peopled by Greeks, who are almost all employed in commerce; and its har bour, which is far from spacious, is much frequented by the small craft of the country, which thence export the produce of the island, and bring back foreign goods in exchange. A few are employed in rural labours. There are five villages occupied by Turks, and by a small number of Jews; and there are five towns and forty-one villages inhabited by Greeks. According to Savery, the number of families in the island is 7300; namely, of Turks 4700, of Greeks 2500, and of Jews 100. Estimating five persons in each family, the population of the island will amount to 36,500. Turner, on the other hand, a later traveller, estimates the inhabitants at only 20,000; namely, 14,000 Greeks, who are dispersed in forty-two villages, and 6000 Turks, with a small mixture of Jews, chiefly residing in the capital.\n",
      "Rhodes has long groaned under the despotic rule of the barbarous Turks, By which the people have been impoverished, and the country depopulated. The pachas, to whom is delegated the supreme rule of the grand signior, generally use their authority for the purpose of extortion, and accumulate riches by robbing the unfortunate inhabitants committed to their charge. According to Savery, the revenue in Rhodes is derived from numerous taxes, namely, a poll-tax, a land-tax, the tithe of the crops, a port duty, a tax on houses, cattle, on salt, on vineyards, on wax, at tolls, and the farming of bagnios. But it is of little moment what taxes are established. There is no restraint on the power of the pacha, who seizes on the people’s substance wherever he sees it, and from whose vigilant rapacity no accumulation of property can be concealed. “Ask not,” says Saveryin his letter to his correspondent, “what is become of that powerful people, who, taking advantage of their happy situation, of their forests, harbours, and of the fertility of their soil, crossed the Mediterranean with their victorious fleets. Liberty is no more; and genius and science exist only where they are encouragcd by her smile. The Turkish government has filled up the measure of their misfortunes; and a few wretches, without commerce, arts, or industry, because they are without property, wander here and there over the desolated plains of the country of their ancestors.”\n",
      "The antiquities in Rhodes are not of an earlier date than the residence of the knights of Malta. The remains of their fine old fortress are still to be seen, namely, a venerable moated castle of great size and strength, so fortified as to seem almost impregnable. The cells of the knights are yet entire, forming a street within the works; and near these is the cathedral or chapel, where doors of sycamore wood, curiously carved, are preserved in their original state. The sanctuary has been converted by the Turks into a magazine for military stores. Dr Clarke observed several inscriptions at Rhodes on marble altars of a cylindrical form, adorned with sculptured wreaths and festoons, supported by rams’ heads. Several vases of great antiquity were also dug up in a garden, of which he obtained one with upright handles.\n",
      "Rhodes was one of the most distinguished states of ancient Greece. Its early history is either lost in the darkness of antiquity, or it is disfigured by fabulous traditions. The Rhodians were early celebrated as expert navigators; but it was not till the time of the Peloponnesian war that they were known as an independent state. The city was afterwards built, and the people were at this time rent into two factions, one of whom favoured the Athenians, the other the Spartans. The latter acquired the ascendency, and an aristocracy was established. The island was afterwards oppressed by Mausolus, king of Caria, and the inhabitants applying to the Athenians, by their assistance regained their liberty. From this period to that of Alexander the Great, the Rhodians enjoyed uninterrupted tranquillity. They voluntarily submitted to that conqueror, from whom they experienced great favour; but no sooner did they hear of his death than they took up arms against the Macedonian garrisons, and expelled them. About this period the city of Rhodes and the inhabitants suffered severely from a dreadful inundation, which was accompanied with violent showers of rain; and hailstones of an extraordinary size beat down many houses, and killed a number of the inhabitants. By the bursting of the wall the extraordinary accumulation of water was allowed a free passage to the sea, by which the danger was removed. From the effects of this unexpected disaster the Rhodians quickly recovered, by their close application to navigation and trade; and during the wars that took place among Alexander’s successors they observed a strict neutrality, and gradually grew to be one of the most opulent states of the age. They were, however, connected in strict alliance with Ptolemy of Egypt, with whom Antigonus being at war, he demanded succours of them, which they refusing, drew on themselves the full weight of his hostility. He accordingly sent his son Demetrius with an immense armament provided with all sorts of machines for war and sieges, and an army of 40,000 troops, who laid siege to their city. This remarkable siege lasted for a year, and called forth on the part of the Rhodians the most brilliant efforts of valour and patriotism. Demetrius, with all his knowledge of the known resources of war, and all his skill to invent new machines of unheard-of power and magnitude, was finally repulsed, with a prodigious slaughter of his bravest troops, and the loss of his military fame. The Rhodians after this siege applied themselves as before to commerce and navigation, and Rhodes became a flourishing city. In the year 203 before the Christian era the Rhodians were engaged in a war with Philip of Macedon, in which being assisted by the Romans, it was terminated to their advantage. In the wars that followed with the Romans and Antiochus, and afterwards with Mithridates, the Rhodians were useful allies of the former, whom they assisted with their naval power. In the civil wars of Rome they aided Pompey against Caesar; and after his death they joined Caesar, which drew on them the resentment of Cassius, by whom their city was taken and plundered. Their privileges were restored by Marc Antony; but the island was finally reduced into a Roman province during the reign of Vespasian. Rhodes continued under the Roman dominion, and was little heard of in history, till, on the downfall of the eastern empire, the island became one of the last retreats of the knights of Jerusalem, under whose rule it became illustrious by its heroic resistance to the Turkish conquerors, then at the utmost height of their power. They baffled by their valour the efforts of Mahommed II., the conqueror of Constantinople; and they sustained a memorable and sa\n",

      "a large river of Western Africa, which falls into the Atlantic a considerable distance to the south of the Gambia. It appears to be now ascertained, that the three great rivers of the western coast, the Senegal, the Gambia, and the Rio Grande, have all their sources very close to each other, in a range of mountains a short distance to the north-west of Teembo, in Foota Jallo. M. Mollien’s account represents the Gambia, called the Ba Diman, and the Rio Grande, called the Comba, as springing from the same basin, amid high mountains. The source of the latter stream is in latitude 10. 37. north, and longitude 11. 17. west. The correctness of this traveller’s statements is confirmed by M. Caillé, who crossed his route. M. Mol-lien, in describing the origin of the rivers, says, that on leaving the village called Toulon, he was led to the summit of one of the mountains which bear the appellation of Badet. Below him appeared two thickets, the one concealing the sources of the Rio Grande, and the other those of the Gambia. The valley in which they are situated forms a kind of funnel, having no other outlets than the two defiles by which the rivers issue. On quitting this basin these rivers pursue their course towards opposite points. The current of the Rio Grande is at first slow and turbid, but it soon clears; and beyond the valley its direction, hitherto north-north-east, changes to the west. After receiving the Tomine or Dongo, it assumes the appellation of Kaboo, a name which also distinguishes the country between the Rio Grande, the Gambia, and the Geba river. The territories bordering on the upper part of its course are inhabited by Foulahs, and the kingdom of Foota Jallo extends along the right bank. Further down, its shores are peopled by the Biafaras 1 Balantes, Papels, and other tribes, and occupied by the kingdoms of Ghinala and Biguba-Near its embouchure it divides into a number of branches, forming alluvial islands, which, with others farther out at sea, compose the Archipelago of the Bissagos. The whole length of its course may be about 500 miles. It falls into the Atlantic fifty leagues to the south of the Gambia.\n",
      "Rio Grande do Norte, a province of Brazil, is bounded on the south by Paraiba, on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by Seara. Situated between the parallels of 4. 10. and 5. 45. of south latitude, the climate is of course very hot. At Cape St Roque, which forms the angle of this province, in longitude 36. 15. west, latitude 5. 7. south, the coast of Brazil terminates towards the north-east; and the Atlantic Ocean, which has so long been its boundary on the east, begins to wash its northern shores. It presents about one hundred miles of sea-coast. The general features of the province may be laid down as displaying a tolerable fertility to the southward of Natal, the capital, and as presenting a barren aspect to the northward of it, except on the banks, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the Rio Grande, or Potengi, the great river of the province. This stream rises in a ridge in the western limits of Rio Grande, and traverses its whole extent in a direction from south-west to north-east. The bar of the Potengi is narrow, but sufficiently deep for vessels of moderate tonnage. The river is very safe within the bar; the water being deep and quite tranquil. The province is irrigated by other streams, on whose banks the most fertile land is to be found. The village and valley of Papari, lying to the north of the Rio Grande, are described as presenting a most inviting aspect. The whole of the valley is cultivated, and when every other part of the surrounding country is parched with drought, and the high sandy lands are rendered quite barren, this place retains its freshest verdure. Although at the distance of three or four leagues from the sea, the salt-water lake of Groahyras communicates with it, so that the inhabitants have the fish brought to their own doors. Between three and four leagues farther is the Indian village of St Joze, situated on a dry sandy soil. A few leagues beyond this place the road passes over a succession of dismal sand-hills. These are perpetually changing their situations and forms; and the high winds raise the sand in clouds, which render the road dangerous when they prevail. The sand is white and very fine, so that horses sink up to the knees at every step; and it is so light as to prevent almost all vegetation.\n",
      "Natal, the capital (so named because the church was consecrated on Christmas-day), sometimes called Cidade dos Reys 1 or City of the Kings, is situated on the right margin of the Rio Grande, about two miles above its mouth. So highly was the position of Natal at one time valued, that during the Dutch war its fortress was deemed the strongest place in Brazil. At present it contains some good streets, squares, and churches, a governor’s palace, a town-hall, prison, and other public buildings. The harbour of Natal is spacious, and a flourishing trade is carried on. The population amounts to about 19,000.\n",
      "To the north of Natal lies the town of Estremoz, about ten miles to the north-west, and at the same distance from the sea. In the western part of the province are several towns, of which the most considerable is that formerly called Assu, but now dignified with the name of Villa Nova da Princesa. It is situated on the left bank of the river of the same name, otherwise called the Parinhas, twenty-five miles from its mouth. Its position is nearly in the centre of Rio Grande; and the road leading from Natal to it having been traversed by Mr Koster, a brief abstract of his description will serve to convey an idea of the character of the province in this quarter. The tract of country through which the road lies, is a plain traversed by a river remarkable for its serpentine evolutions. Here is a place called Lagoa Seca, or dry lake; a place which is laid under water by the rains, but which supplies the capital with farinha during the drought. Between eight and ten leagues from Natal is Pai Paulo, a place situated on the borders of the Sertam, a long barren plain of five days’ journey. This scene is desolate and dreary in the extreme. On approaching Assu, however, lands covered with wood make their appearance; and fazendas and other indications of human neighbourhood rise around. The town of Assu is situated upon the northern bank of the smaller branch of the river Assu, which here runs for a short distance in two channels. This place, chiefly built in the form of a square, contains several churches, and other public buildings. There are numerous salt-works in the vicinity, which bring some trade to the place, and large barks in the proper season ascend the river to the town. At the distance of about a league from Assu is the lake of Piato, three leagues in length by one in breadth, which is filled by the river in the rainy season, and is never quite dry. In summer its sides afford a rich soil for the cultivation of rice, maize, the cane, melons, and cotton. Between this place and the frontier of the province of Seara, a distance of four days’ journey, the country consists for the most part of plains, with trees thinly scattered, and patches of wood. Several salt-marshes intervene, and these, during the rainy season, form lakes. The Arraial of St Luzia stands on the left bank of the river Appody, about twenty miles from the sea. Large canoes advance up the river to this place, which carries on a trade in salt. From this situation downwards are found the famous salterns of Massoro, the salt of which is as white as snow. The Appody has a course of a hundred and thirty miles, running almost the whole way through a flat country, interspersed with lakes, which it fills by its floods. This river forms the boundary line between Rio Grande do Norte and Seara. The soil of many parts of this province is favourable to the growth of sugar-cane, and some trade is carried on in sugar, which, together with salt, seems to be the staple of commerce in this quarter of Brazil. The population of the whole province is not supposed to exceed 80,000 inhabitants.\n",
      "Rio Grande do Sul, formerly the most southern province in the empire of Brazil, but, according to recent accounts, now an independent republic of South America. It declared its independence in 1836, and resolved on introducing a constitution similar to that of the United States of North America. In April and May 1838 two severe conflicts took place between the troops of the emperor of Brazil and the insurgents, in both of which the former were defeated with great slaughter. Whether this country may ultimately succeed in maintaining its position among the republican states of South America, appears very doubtful. Rio Grande do Sul is bounded on the north by St Catharina and St Paulo; on the west by the river Uruguay, which separates it from the republic of the same name; on the south by the river Plata; and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean. Itis upwards of five hundred miles in length by four hundred in breadth, lying between latitude 28° and 35° south, and enjoys a temperate and salubrious climate. This extensive country chiefly consists of large plains, covered with immense herds of cattle and other animals. Some mountain-ridges traverse it in various directions, but none of them is of any great height. Here several large rivers have their origin, of which the Uruguay, the Jacuhy or Rio Pardo, and the Camapuam, are the most important Its great extent Of level and alluvial coast exhibits some lakes of vast dimensions. The Lagoa dos Patos is the largest lake in Brazil, being one hundred and fifty miles in length from northeast to south-west and about forty miles in breadth. It is said to derive its name from a species of fowl which frequents its waters in great numbers. This lake is the recipient of almost all the streams which irrigate the northern and eastern portions of the country. It is very shallow, and its \n",

      "one of the greatest historians of modern times, was the son of the Rev. William Robertson, minister of Borthwick, in the county of Edinburgh, and of Eleanor, the daughter of David Pitcairne, Esq. of Dreghorn. He was descended from the Robertsons of Gladney, a branch of the family which for many fenerations has possessed the estate of Struan in Perthshire.\n",
      "le was born at Borthwick in the year 1721, and received his early education at Dalkeith school, under Mr Leslie, a classical teacher of much reputation. In 1733 his father became one of the ministers of Old Greyfriar’s Church in Edinburgh, and towards the close of the same year, the son commenced his academical studies. He speedily distinguished himself as a young man of superior talents and attain ments. He obtained his license in 1741, and in 1743 he was appointed minister of Gladsmuir in the county of Haddington. In 1758 he was translated to Lady Yester⅛ parish in Edinburgh, and other preferments speedily followed. In 1759 he was appointed chaplain of Stirling Castle; in 1761, one of his Majesty’s chaplains in ordinary; and in 1762 he was elected principal of the university. In 1764 the office of historiographer to the king for Scotland was revived in his favour, and was accompanied with a salary of two hundred pounds a year. The emoluments arising from this accumulation of offices far exceeded what any Presbyterian clergyman in Scotland had previously enjoyed. About the period of his translation to Edinburgh he was created D. D.\n",
      "We find it difficult to ascertain at what period were first unfolded the great and singular talents which destined Dr Robertson to be one of the first writers that rescued this island from the reproach of not having any good historians. We are, however, assured, that before tbe publication of any of his literary performances, even from his first appearance in public life, his abilities had begun to attract the notice of observing men; and to his more intimate friends he discovered marks of such high-minded ambition, as, seconded by those abilities, could not have failed to carry him to tile first honours of his profession, in whatever sphere he had been placed, and whatever opposition he might have had to encounter.\n",
      "The first theatre tllat offered for the display of his talents was the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. It is the annual meetings of this court that produce to view men who would otherwise remain in the deepest obscurity. There the humble pastor, whose lot has been cast in the remotest corner of the Highland wilds, feels himself, for a time, on a footing of equality with the first citizen in the kingdom: he can there dispute with him the prize of eloquence, the most flattering distinction to a liberal mind; a distinction which is naturally sought after with the greater eagerness in that assembly, as the simple establishment of the Church of Scotland has rendered it the only pre-eminence to which the greatest part of its members can ever hope to attain.\n",
      "From the moment Dr Robertson first appeared in this assembly, he became the object of universal attention and applause. His speeches were marked with the same manly and persuasive eloquence that distinguishes his historical compositions; and it was observed by all, that while his young rivals in oratory contented themselves with opening a cause, or delivering a studied harangue, he showed equal ability to start objections or to reply; and that even his most unpremeditated effusions were not unadorned with those harmonious and seemingly measured periods which have been so much admired in his works of labour and reflection. He soon came to be considered as the ablest supporter of the cause which he chose to espouse, and was now the unrivalled leader of one of the great parties which have long divided the church of which he was a member. When we reflect upon this circumstance, and consider how much mankind are the same in every society, we shall be the less surprised to find in the literary works of Dr Robertson an acquaintance with the human heart, and a knowledge of the world, which we in vain look for in many other historians. The man who has spent his life in the difficult task of conducting the deliberations of a popular assembly, in regulating the passions, the interests, the prejudices, of a numerous faction, has advantages over the mere man of letters, which no ability, no study, no second-hand information, can ever compensate.\n",
      "The first work which extended his reputation beyond the walls of the General Assembly was a sermon preached at Edinburgh in 1758 before the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, the subject of which was, “The State of the World at the Appearance of Jesus Christ.” The ingenuity with which a multiplicity of detached circumstances are there collected, and shown to tend to one single point, afforded a fair promise of those peculiar powers which he so conspicuously displayed in his historical works. This sermon, which was immediately published, did great honour to the author; and it is probably to the reputation which he thus acquired, that we are to attribute the unanimity with which he was called to be one of the ministers of Edinburgh.\n",
      "In 1759, he published, in two volumes quarto, “The History of Scotland during the reigns of Queen Mary, and of King James VI. till his accession to the Crown of England, with a Review of the Scots History previous to that period.” This work, in its structure, is one of the most complete of all modern histories. It is not a dry jejune narrative of events, destitute of ornament; nor is it a mere frothy relation, all glow and colouring. The historian discovers sufficient powers of imagination to engage the reader’s attention, with a due proportion of judgment to check the exuberance of fancy. The arrangement of his work is admirable, and his descriptions are animated. His style is copious, nervous, and correct. He has displayed consummate skill in rendering such passages of our history as are familiar to our recollection agreeable and entertaining. He has embellished old materials with all the elegance of modern dress. He has very judiciously avoided too circumstantial a detail of trite facts. His narratives are succinct and spirited; his reflections copious, frequent, and generally pertinent. His sentiments respecting the guilt of Mary have indeed been warmly controverted by Tytler, Stuart, and Whitaker; and, till the publication of Mr Laing’s Dissertation on the same subject, the general opinion seemed to be that their victory was complete. Dr Robertson was no rancorous or malignant enemy of the unfortunate queen. While relating what he doubtless believed, he makes every possible allowance for Mary from the circumstances in which she was placed; and his history will be read with pleasure by candid men of all parties as long as the language in which it is composed shall continue to be understood.\n",
      "In 1769, Dr Robertson published, in three volumes quarto, “The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V. with a View of the Progress of Society in Europe from the Subversion of the Roman Empire to the beginning of the sixteenth century.” The vast and general importance of the period which this history comprises, together with the reputation which the historian had deservedly acquired, cooperated to raise such high expectations in the public, that no work perhaps was ever more impatiently expected, or perused with greater avidity. The first volume, which contains an able and eloquent view of the progress of society, is a very valuable part of the work; for it serves not only as a key to the pages that follow, but may be considered as a general introduction to the stu<ly of the history of that period, in which the several powers of Europe were formed into one great political system, in which each took a station, in which it long remained, with less alterations than could have been expected, after the shocks occasioned by so many internal revolutions and so many foreign wars. Of the history itself, it may be sufficient to observe, that it has secured to the author a place among the greatest historians of modern times. It is distinguished by elegance of expression, depth of discernment, and correctness of judgment. The characters are drawn with singular skill. They are not contrasted by a studied antithesis, but by an opposition which results from a very acute and penetrating insight into the real merits of each character, fairly deduced from the several circumstances of his conduct exemplified in the history. For this work the author received L.4500 sterling.\n",
      "In 1779, Dr Robertson published “The History of America,” in two volumes quarto. This celebrated work may with great propriety be considered as a sequel to the preceding history. From the close of the fifteenth century we date the most splendid era in the annals of modern times. Discoveries were then made, the influence of which descended to posterity; and events happened that gave a new direction to the spirit of nations. To the inhabitants of Europe, America was in every respect a new world. There the face of the earth changed its appearance. The plants and trees and animals were strange, and nature seemed no longer the same. A continent opened that appeared to have recently come from the hands of the Creator, and which showed lakes, rivers, and mountains on a grander scale, and the vegetable kingdom in greater magnificence, than in the other quarters of the globe, but the animal tribes in a state of degradation, few in number, degenerated in kind, imperfect, and unfinished. The human species in the earliest stage of its progress, vast and numerous nations in the rudest form of the savage state which philosophers have contemplated, and tw , o great empires in the lowest degree of civilization which any records have transmitted to our review, presented to the philosophic eye at this period the most fruitful subject of speculation that was to be f\n",

      "was born on the 19th of February 1718. He was the descendant of an ancient family, and was related to the duke of Chandos. His father Henry Rodney obtained, at the age of fourteen, a commission as cornet of horse; but having quitted the army after a short period of service, he settled at Walton-upon-Thames, and married Mary, eldest daughter and coheiress of Sir Henry Newton, envoy extraordinary to the grand duke of Tuscany, and afterwards judge of the court of admiralty. Through the interest of the duke, who usually attended the king on his journeys to and from Hanover, Mr Rodney obtained the command of the royal yacht; and having on one of these occasions been asked what mark of favour he would wish the king to confer upon him, he requested that his majesty would stand sponsor for his son. Such a request was easily granted; and accordingly his second son was named after his royal and noble godfathers.\n",
      "At a very early age he was sent to Harrow school; and having quitted it at the age of twelve, he received from the king a letter of service, the last ever granted, and went to sea On the Newfoundland station he served for six years with Admiral Medley. On the 15th of February 1739 he was made lieutenant in the Dolphin, by Admiral Haddock, in the Mediterranean, and served successively in the Essex, Royal Sovereign, and Namur. Admiral Mathews having in 1742 appointed him to the Plymouth of sixty-four guns, he convoyed three hundred sail of the Lisbon trade through the midst of the French fleet, then cruising in the channel; and for his conduct on this occasion he received the warmest thanks of the merchants. In the rank of captain he was confirmed by the admiralty, and was appointed to the command of the Sheerness, in which he continued for eighteen months. He was then removed to the Ludlow Castle, of forty guns. In this ship he fought and took the great St Maloes privateer, of forty guns, and one hundred men above his own complement. From this period till December 1745, he was employed in various pieces of service, which afforded him no particular opportunities of obtaining distinction. Having been appointed to the Centurion, he for two years cruised in the North Sea; and on that station he commanded while the pretender was in Edinburgh, and until the arrival of Admiral Byng. He was now promoted to the command of the Eagle, of sixty-four guns; and in 1747 he was despatched in a small squadron for the purpose of intercepting the French fleet, llomeward-bound from St Domingo. On the 20th of June they fell in with this fleet off Cape Ortegal. The French men-of-war deserted their convoy during the night, and no fewer than forty-eight merchantmen were captured. Rodney afterwards joined the squadron of Admiral Hawke, and bore a distinguished part in the action off Finisterre on the 14th of October in the same year. Near the close of this war, a small squadron, of which the Eagle was one, fell in with a Spanish fleet from the West Indies, consisting of twelve sail of the line with a rich convoy, and, notwithstanding their own inferiority, they took from them six sail of merchantmen.\n",
      "Captain Rodney was appointed to the Rainbow in March 1748, and was soon afterwards sent as governor and commander-in-chief on the Newfoundland station. This was his first appearance with the rank of commodore. He had received particular instructions to discover, if possible, an island in the Western Ocean, said to be in lat. 49. N., about three hundred leagues from Britain. After cruising fourteen days to no purpose, he sailed for St John’s, the seat of his government. In this station he continued till the month of October 1752, when he returned home to take his seat in parliament, having been elected for the borough of Saltash.\n",
      "In May 1757 he sailed in the Dublin, of seventy-four guns, with Hawke’s expedition for the bombardment of Rochefort; and in February 1758, with Boscawen in the expedition against Louisbourg. On the 19th of May 1759 he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral, and was immediately appointed to the command of a small squadron destined to bombard Havre de Grace. This service he performed in a very effectual manner; and having continued to keep the sea till the close of the ensuing year, he returned to Britain. In 1761 he was elected member of parliament for Penryn. On the 6th of October he hoisted his flag on board the Marlborough, having been appointed commander-in-chief at Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands, and to conduct the naval operations of the armament destined for the attack of Martinique. This island, together with St Lucia, was speedily reduced.\n",
      "The admiral returned home on the 12th of August 1763. On the 21st of the preceding October he had been made vice-admiral of the blue. In 1764 he was created a baronet, and during the following year was appointed governor of Greenwich Hospital. In 1768 he was returned to parliament for Northampton. On the 18th of October 1770 he became vice-admiral of the white, and on the 24th of October 1771 vice-admiral of the red. During the latter year, on the 23d of January, he had been appointed commander-in-chief at Jamaica, and with this command was not permitted to retain the office of governor. Having returned to Britain, he struck his flag at Portsmouth on the 4th of September 1774.\n",
      "Being inattentive, as many seamen are, to the rules of economy, his circumstances became so embarrassed that he was obliged to fly from his country, with very slight hopes of ever being able to return. He was in France when the ill-advised policy of that court prompted them to take a decided part with America against Great Britain; and it is said that some men in power, no strangers to the desperate state of Sir George’s affairs, offered him a high command in the French navy, if he would carry arms against his own country. This offer he rejected with becoming indignation. Soon after this gallant behaviour, the duke de Chartres, afterwards the infamous Orleans, told Sir George that he was himself to have a command in the fleet to be opposed to that under the command of his countryman Kep-pel; and witll an insulting air asked him what he thought would be the consequence of their meeting. “That my countryman will carry your highness with him to learn English,” was the high-spirited reply. These statements do not perhaps rest on sufficient authority; but we learn from his own correspondence, that Maréchal Biron expressed his willingness to advance whatever sum he might require, even to the amount of two thousand pounds. Having accepted a loan of a thousand louis, he w-as in 1778 enabled to pay his bills in Paris, and to revisit his own country. He was speedily enabled to discharge this debt, and to make a satisfactory arrangement with his creditors.\n",
      "On the 1st of October 1779, Rodney was appointed commander-in-chief of Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands.\n",
      "His first exploit after this appointment was on the 8th of\n",
      "January ensuing, when he took sixteen Spanish transports, together with seven ships and vessels of war, which had left St Sebastian’s a week before. On the 16th of the same month he fell in with the Spanish fleet, consisting of eleven sail of the line, under the command of Don Juan de Langara; of which one was blown up during the engagement, five were taken and carried into Gibraltar, among which was the admiral’s ship, and the rest were much shattered. In April the same year, he fell in with the French fleet under the command of Admiral Guichen, at Martinique, whom he compelled to fight, and whom he com pletely beat; though, from the shattered state of his own fleet, and the unwillingness of the enemy to risk another action, he took none of their ships. The successful efforts of the gallant admiral during the year 1780 were generally applauded through the nation. He received the thanks of both houses of parliament, and addresses of thanks from various parts of Great Britain, and the islands to which his victories were more particularly serviceable. In December the same year, he made an unsuccessful attempt, together with General Vaughan, on St Vincent’s. In 1781, he continued his exertions, with much success, in defending the West India Islands; and, along with the above-named general, he conquered St Eustatius, on which occasion his conduct to the inhabitants has been much, though perhaps unjustly, censured. The island was certainly a nest of contraband traders. On the 12th of April 1782, he came to a close action with the French fleet under Count de Grasse; during which he sunk one ship and took five, of which the admiral’s ship, the Ville de Paris, was one. On the 22d of May, the thanks of both houses of parliament were voted to the admiral, his officers, and seamen, for this brilliant and decisive victory. He was appointed vice-admiral of Great Britain, and was raised to tbe peerage by the title of Baron Rodney of Stoke in Somersetshire. The House of Commons voted him an annual pension of L.2000. In the year 1793 this pension was permanently settled on the title; and in 1806 a pension of L.1000 Irish was granted to his grandson for life. Having been superseded, very ungraciously, in his command, Lord Rodney once more steered a homeward course. He landed at Bristol on the 15th of September 1782, and next day proceeded to join his family at Purbrook near Portsmouth. He survived for ten years, having died on the 24th of May 1792, after he had completed the seventy-fourth year of his age. ^[1. The Life and Correspondence of the late Admiral Lord Rodney.

      "the head History (Ecclesiastical) will be found an account of the rise and progress of that religious system which, before tbe sixteenth century, held undisputed sway in what was called the Christian world. Under the head Reformation is given a history of the successful struggles made by sevetal of the states of Europe to deliver themselves from priestly domination; and for a view of the theological tenets of the Roman Catholics, we may refer to the articles Pope, Popery, Purgatory, &c. It only remains that we shortly notice the extent to which the Roman Catholic faith prevails in the world at the present day, and the political state of its adherents in our own country.\n",
      "There is no country where popery is the established reli gion, in the same sense in which the Churches of England and Scotland are the established religion of Britain. The Catholic clergy everywhere claim independent, if not supreme authority, and never form any political alliance with the state. In some countries, however, popery is not only the religion of the government, but also exclusively, or almost exclusively, of the people; and to that extent it may be called the established religion of the state. In others, the people are divided between the catholic and the protestant faith, and both are recognised by the government. The cruelty and oppression which have been perpetrated by religious zealots, ambitious priests, and crafty rulers, under the sacred name of religion, have given occasion to the infidel and the scoffer to cast on Christianity itself the reproach which is due only to fanaticism and bigotry. Tothisreproach both Catholic and Protestant are liable; but there can be no doubt, that in the efforts,of the Church of Rome to maintain its ancient dominion over the human mind, it has been more unscrupulous in the use of persecution than the Protestant powers. Happily, however, the fierceness of persecution has now greatly abated in catholic countries; and, on the other hand, Catholics are tolerated in every protestant state.\n",
      "In France the Charte gives freedom of worship to all religions; butabout 14-15ths of the people belong to the Catholic Church, the small remainder being Protestants.\n",
      "In Switzerland, outer Appenzell, almost the whole of Berne, Basel, Schaffhausen, Vaud, and Neufchatel, the greater part of Glarus, Grisons, Aargau, Thurgau, and Geneva, and the minority in Friburg, Soleure, and St. Gall, profess Calvinism. Catholicism is professed exclusively in Lucerne, Uri, Schwitz, Unterwald, Zug, inner Appenzell, Fessin, and Valais; by the majority in Friburg, Soleure, and St. Gall; and by the minority in theother cantons. About 12-20ths of the Swiss are Protestant; the remainder Catholics.\n",
      "In Belgium all religions are freely professed; butcatho-licism is the religion of almost the entire nation.\n",
      "In Holland all religions are professed with equal freedom; but Calvinism is the religion of the state. The Catholics are comparatively few.\n",
      "In Germany catholicism and protestantism are so mixed, that it is scarcely possible to assign them definite limits, or approximate to their relative numbers. Protestantism, however, prevails mostly in the northern and south-western parts of the country; popery in the south-east, south, and west. Their numbers are not far from being equal.\n",
      "In the Austrian empire popery is the dominant religion, and professed by the great majority of the inhabitants.\n",
      "In Prussia protestantism is the government religion; but the professors of all religions enjoy freedom of worship, and almost equal rights. Lutheranism is professed by the great majority in East Prussia, Brandenburg, Pomerania, and Saxony; popery in the Westphalian and Rhenish provinces, and the grand-duchy of Posen. Silesiaand West Prussia are almost equally divided.\n",
      "In Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, Lutheranism is the State religion, but all others are tolerated. The Catholics are few in number.\n",
      "Catholics abound in Russia, but mostly in the Polish provinces, where they are not only freely tolerated, but enjoy every political right in common with other subjects. Their number may amount to about 12,000,000, or l-5th of the population of the empire.\n",
      "In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, popery is dominant and exclusive; but other religions, though not legally tolerated, are not now persecuted.\n",
      "In Turkey and Greece popery is fully tolerated, but professed by few if by any of the natives.\n",
      "In America popery is the dominant religion of all the late Spanish and Portuguese colonies. In some of them no other religion is tolerated by law, but nobody is persecuted for professing any other. In the United States of North America, there are about 800,000 Catholics. In Lower Canada, they form the majority of the population.\n",
      "In Great Britain popery is now not merely tolerated, but Roman Catholics are admitted to equal, or nearly equal, political rights witll Protestants.\n",
      "In 1837, the total number of Catholics throughout the world, was reckoned by Adrien Balbi at 1.39,000,000, out of 737,000,000, which he considers to be the total population of the globe.\n",
      "Before the passing of tile various Roman Catholic Emancipation Acts, the Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland were subjected to a system of stringent penal laws. The laws in force against them, previously to the Act 18 Geo. III. cap. 60; and 31 Geo. III. cap. 32, may be divided into three classes: 1. Those respecting persons professing popery. 2. Those respecting popish recusants convict. 3. Those respecting popish priests.\n",
      "I. Persons professing popery, besides the penalties for not attending their parish church, were disabled from taking their lands by either descent or purchase, after eighteen years of age, until they renounced tbeir errors; were obliged at twenty-one to register their estates before acquired, and all future conveyances and wills relating to them; were incapable of presenting to any advowson, or granting to any other person any avoidance of the same; might not keep or teach any school under pain of perpetual imprisonment; and if they willingly heard or said mass, they forfeited for the one 100, and tor the other 200 marks, and were to suffer a year’s imprisonment. If any evil industry was used to rivet the errors of popery upon those who already professed it; if any person sent another abroad to be educated in popery, or to reside in any religious house for that purpose, or contributed to his maintenance when there, the sent, the sender, and the contributor, were disabled to sue in law or equity, to be executor or administrators to any person, or to bear any office in the realm, and forfeited all their goods and chattels, and likewise all their real estate for life. Where these errors were aggravated by apostacy or perversion, where a person was reconciled to the see of Rome, or procured others to be reconciled, the offence amounted to high treason.\n",
      "II. Popish recusants convicted in a court of law of not attending the service of the Church -of England, were subject to the following disabilities, penalties, and forfeitures, over and above those before mentioned. They were considered as persons excommunicated; they could hold no office or employment; if they kept arms in their houses, the same might be seized by the Justices of the Peace; they might not come within ten miles of London, under the penalty ol’L 100; could bring no action at law or suit in equity; were not allowed to travel above five miles from home, unless by licence, upon pain of forfeiting all their goods; and they might not come to court under the penalty of L.100. No marriage or burial of such recusant, or baptism of his child, should be had otherwise than by the ministers of the Church of England, underother severe penalties. A married woman, when recusant, forfeited two-thirds of her dower or jointure, and might not be executrix, or administratrix to her husband, or have any part of his goods; and during the coverture might be kept in prison, unless her husband redeemed her at the rate of L.l 0 a month, or the third part of all his lands. And, lastly, as a.femme couverte (married woman) recusant might be imprisoned, so all others must, within three months after conviction, either submit, and renounce their errors, or, if required so to do by four justices, abjure and renounce the realm; and if they did not depart, or if they returned without the king’s licence, they should be guilty of felony, without benefit of clergy. There w , as also an inferior kind of recusancy, (refusing to make the declaration against popery enjoined by Act 30 Car. II. cap. 2, when tendered by the proper magistrate,) which, if the party resided within ten miles of London, made him an absolute recusant convict; or, if at a greater distance, suspended him from having any seat in Parliament, keeping arms in his house, or any horse above the value of L.5.\n",
      "III. Popish priests were placed in a still more slavish situation. For, by statute 11 and 12 Wil. III. c. 4, popish priests or bishops celebrating mass, and exercising any part of their functions in England, except in the houses of ambassadors, were liable to perpetual imprisonment. And by the statute 27 Eliz. c. 2, any popish priest born in the dominions of the crown of England, who should come hither from beyond sea, or should be in England without conforming, and taking the oaths, was guilty of high treason; and all persons harbouring him were guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.\n",
      "The first amendment of these inhuman laws, which affix an everlasting stain on the British name, was effected by the statute 18 Geo. III. c. 60. With regard to such papists as should duly take the oath therein prescribed, of allegiance to his Majesty, abjuration of the Pretender, renunciation of the Pope’s civil power, and abhorrence of the doctrines of destroying and not keeping faith with heretics, and deposing or murdering princes excommunicated by authority of the see of Rome, the statute 11 and 12 W. III. was repealed, so far a\n",

      "----\n",
      "one of the most enlightened and virtuous public men whom England has ever possessed, was, as his family-name indicates, the descendant of a French family. He was the son of a jeweller in London, and was born there on the 1st of March 1757.\n",
      "The education of this child, destined in time to occupy so distinguished a place, was conducted for some time with even less care than might have been expected from the station held by his family. But, heartily disliking his father’s business, he was at length allowed to change it for professional employments, though as yet in an inferior department. At the age of sixteen he was articled to one of the six clerks in chancery; and in the easy mechanical duties of his master’s chambers, relieved by the zealous prosecution of his studies both in English and Latin, passed several years of his life. He then resolved on coming to the bar, a step which, he informs us, all his friends, with one exception, considered as highly imprudent. One circumstance which helped to determine Romilly was very interesting; the purchase of a seat in the office in which he had been articled would have cost a sum which he knew it would be inconvenient for his father to advance.\n",
      "He had completed his twenty-first year when he entered himself at Gray’s Inn, becoming, at the same time, a pupil of an able equity-draftsman. General reading both in English and Latin, translation habitually practised from the latter language into the former, the composition of a few political essays for the newspapers, and occasional attendance on the houses of parliament, now alternated with a closeness of application to legal study, which, after a time, injured his health, and compelled him to retire, first to Bath, and afterwards to the continent. At Geneva he became acquainted with some of the men who were then beginning to attract notice in that city; and, among acquaintances thus made, the most valuable was that of Dumont. After visiting some of the nearest scenery of the Leman Lake, and of Savoy, Romilly proceeded to Paris, where he met D’Alembert, Diderot, and other eminent men.\n",
      "On the last day of Easter term 1783, he was called to the bar. For some years afterwards, he obtained an increasing employment in the drawing of chancery pleadings; but during this time, as he says himself, he had hardly once occasion to open his lips in court. In the spring of 1784, he went upon the midland circuit, which he continued to frequent until, even as admitted in his own modest Memoir, he was decidedly its leader. His chancery business, however, to which at length he entirely devoted himself, had become very great before he confined himself entirely to town; and his principal reason for remaining so long on the circuit, is assigned by himself in one of his calmly characteristic expressions of honourable ambition: he desired to qualify himself for being a judge.\n",
      "Long before he left the circuit, he had attained a distinguished position in the eyes of those who were qualified to appreciate him, not merely as a lawyer, but as a statesman. In 1784, he became acquainted with Mirabeau, who was then in London, and of whose character he appears to have formed an exceedingly just estimate. Mirabeau was the medium through which Romilly became known to Lord Lansdowne, and thus to the leaders of that political party of which he had throughout been an honest and warm adherent. To that nobleman he was recommended, both by the hearty praises of Mirabeau, and by a pamphlet he had written, called “A Fragment on the Constitutional Power and Duties of Juries.” Lord Lansdowne, directing Romilly’s attention to a recent sanguinary tract on Criminal Punishments, induced him to write an answer, which was published anonymously, under the title of “Observations on a late Publication, entitled ‘ Thoughts on Executive Justice.’” In the mean time he continued vigorously to prosecute in private the inquiries into the Reform of the Laws, especially the Criminal Laws, of which he had thus begun to announce publicly the parts.\n",
      "In the vacation of 1788, he paid a third visit to Paris. Introductions from England, and other circumstances, brought Romilly and his fellow-traveller Dumont into intercourse, upon this occasion, with many men distinguished then, and with others still more celebrated in the bloody struggle that was about to ensue. Mirabeau at this time translated into French, and published, observations made by Romilly on the Hospital and Prison of Bicêtre. This pamphlet had the honour to be suppressed by the police of Paris, but in the original English was afterwards printed by the author himself in an obscure London periodical. In July 1789, Romilly wrote a pamphlet which was afterwards published; “Thoughts on the Probable Influence of the French Revolution on Great Britain.” But the lively interest he took in the events which emerged in Paris, while he was engaged in composing these remarks, led him back to that city in August of the same year; and he now saw, both in public and private, many of the persons who had become most distinguished in the National Assembly. Dumont’s observations upon the eventful summer of 1789 in France, were translated into English by Romilly, and, with the addition of some observations by himself on England, were published in 1792, receiving the title of “Groenvelt’s Letters.” Many of Romilly’s opinions on the progress of the French Revolution are contained in his published correspondence with Dumont, Madame Gautier, Dugald Stewart, and others, and in a diary which he kept during a journey to Paris in the autumn of 1802.\n",
      "While Romilly was thus advancing to the highest rank in his profession, and had gained the confidence and admiration of some of the best statesmen in England, his domestic position underwent a most beneficial change, the immediate cause of which was a visit paid to Lord Lansdowne. In his private Memoirs he thus speaks of a person whom he accidentally met on this occasion. “I saw in her the most beautiful and accomplished creature that ever blessed the sight and understanding of man. A most intelligent mind, an uncommonly correct judgment, a lively imagination, a cheerful disposition, a noble and generous way of thinking, an elevation and heroism of character, and a warmth and tenderness of affection, such as is rarely found even in her sex, were among her extraordinary endowments. I was captivated alike by the beauties of her person and the charms of her mind. A mutual attachment was formed betwecn us, which at the end of little more than a year was consecrated by marriage. All the happiness I have known in her beloved society, all the many and exquisite enjoyments which my dear children have afforded me, even my extraordinary success in my profession, the labours of which, if my life had not been so cheered and exhilarated, I never could have undergone,— all are to be traced to this trivial cause.” The object of this beautiful eulogium was the eldest daughter of Mr Gar-bett of Knill Court in Herefordshire. His marriage with this lady took place in January 1798, when he had nearly completed his forty-first year.\n",
      "He continued to be chiefly occupied in the discharge of his duties as a leader of the Chancery bar for several years, after which he united with these the other avocations that have given to his name so distinguished a place in the list of British statesmen. In the autumn of 1805 he had received from the Prince of Wales the offer of a seat in parliament, which he declined upon grounds strongly marking his sturdy independence of character. These reasons were the same which, many years before, had made him interfere to prevent a similar offer from being addressed to him by Lord Lansdowne. He said that, notwithstanding the declaration made, in both cases, of his being totally unfettered, yet he never could feel real independence while he thus held his place in the Commons by favour; and, he adds, “I formed to myself an unalterable resolution, never, unless I held a public office, to come into parliament but by a popular election, or by paying the common price for my seat. As to the first of these, I knew, of course, that I must never look for it; and as for the latter, I determined to wait till the labours of my profession should have enabled me to accomplish it without being guilty of any great extravagance.” He was soon rewarded for the scrupulous feeling of honour which had thus forced him to decline a place, that held out to him, as he confesses, very strong temptations.\n",
      "In February 1806, he was appointed Solicitor General under the government of Mr Fox and Lord Grenville, with neither of whom had he previously any connexion. He was obliged, much against his will, to accept the honour of knighthood, and was elected to represent the borough of Qneenborough, accepting this seat, without scruple, from the government. “If I had come in,” says he, “as a private individual, I would not have accepted a seat from any body; but as long as I hold the office to which I have been appointed, I must support the administration. As soon as they appear to me unworthy to be supported, it will be my duty to resign.” Of the public life which commenced under these auspices, and was prematurely brought to a close in thirteen years, Sir Samuel Romilly kept a minute and faithful diary, the contents of which have lately been made known to the world. No existing record of a political career presents a purer picture than does this ;—the history of a course of public conduct directed invariably by those qualities of mind and heart which we have, even in this hasty sketch, seen to have guided the earlier years spent in his family and in his profession. It is impossible to embrace, within these limits, so much as a catalogue of the parliamentary measures in which he took a share, in the way of inciting others to action, in the way of himself acting and speaking and writing in favour of reforms in the laws and constitution, in the w\n",

      "----\n",
      "one of the most renowned writers of modem times, was born at Geneva on the 28th of June 1712. His father was by profession a clock and watch maker. At his birth, which, he says, was the first of his misfortunes, he endangered the life of his mother; and he himself was for a long time afterwards in a very weak and languishing state of health. But as his bodily strength increased, his mental powers gradually opened, and afforded the happiest presages of future greatness. His father, a citizen of Geneva, was a well-informed tradesman; and in the place where he wrought he kept a Plutarch and a Tacitus, authors which of course soon became familiar to his son. A rash juvenile step, however, occasioned his leaving his father’s house. “Finding himself a fugitive in a strange country, and without money or friends, he changed his religion, in order to procure a subsistence.” Bornex, bishop of Anneci, from whom he sought an asylum, committed the care of his education to Madame de Warrens, a lady, who in 1726 had left part of her wealth, and the Protestant religion, in order to throw herself into the bosom of the Catholic church. This generous lady served in the triple capacity of a mother, a friend, and a lover, to the new proselyte, whom, in fact, she regarded as her son. The necessity of procuring for himself some settlement, however, or perhaps his unsettled disposition, obliged Rousseau often to take leave of this tender mother.\n",
      "He possessed more than ordinary talents for music; and the Abbé Blanchard flattered his hopes of a place in the royal chapel, which he, however, failed in obtaining for him. He was therefore under the necessity of teaching music at Chamberi. He remained in this place till 1741, in which year he went to Paris, where he was long in very destitute circumstances. Writing to a friend in 1743, he thus expresses himself: “Every thing is dear here, especially bread.” But he at length began to emerge from that obscurity in which he had hitherto been buried; and his friends placed him with M. de Montaigne, ambassador from France to Venice. According to his own confession, a proud misanthropy, and a peculiar contempt of the riches and pleasures of this world, constituted the chief traits in his character; and a misunderstanding soon took place between him and the ambassador. The place of depute, under M. Dupin, farmer-general, a man of considerable parts, gave him some temporary relief, and enabled him to be of some benefit to Madame de Warrens, his former benefactress. But the year 1750 proved the commencement of his literary career. The academy of Dijon had proposed the following question: “Whether the revival of the arts and sciences has contributed to the refinement of manners ?” Rousseau at first inclined to support the affirmative. “Take the negative side of the question,” said a philosopher, who was at that time his friend, “and I’ll promise you the greatest success.”\n",
      "His discourse against the sciences having been found to be the best written, and replete with brilliant reasoning, was publicly crowned with the approbation of that learned body. Never was a paradox supported with greater eloquence. It was not however a new one; but he enriched it with all the advantages which either knowledge or genius could confer upon it. Immediately after its appearance, he met with several opponents of his tenets, which he defended; and, from one dispute to another, he found himself involved in a formidable train of correspondence, without having ever almost dreamed of such opposition. From that period he decreased in happiness as he increased in celebrity. His Discourse on the Causes of Inequality amongst Mankind, and on the Origin of Social Compacts, was written with a view to prove that mankind are equal; that they were born to live apart from each other; and that they have perverted the order of nature in forming societies. He bestows the highest praise on the State of Nature, and deprecates the idea of every social compact. By presenting this performance to the magistrates of Geneva, he was received again into his native country, and reinstated in all the privileges and rights of a citizen, after having with much difficulty prevailed on himself to abjure the Catholic religion. He soon returned to France, however, and lived for some time in Paris. He afterwards gave himself up to retirement, partly to escape the shafts of criticism, and partly to follow the regimen which the strangury, with which he was afflicted, necessarily required. This is an important epoch in the history of his life, as it was owing to this circumstance, perhaps, that we have the most elegant works that have proceeded from his pen. His Letter to M. d’Alembert on the design of erecting a theatre at Geneva, written in his retirement, and published in the year 1757, contains, along with some paradoxes, some very important and well-handled truths. This letter first drew down upon him the envy of Voltaire, and was the cause of those indignities with which that author never ceased to load him. Although so great an enemy to theatrical representations, he caused a comedy to be printed; and in 1752 he gave to the theatre a pastoral, called the Village Conjuror, of which he composed the poetry and the music, both of them abounding with sentiment and elegance, and full of innocent rural simplicity. His Dictionary of Music affords several excellent articles; some of them, however, are extremely inaccurate. “This work,” says M. la Borde, in his Essay on Music, “has need to be written over again, to save much trouble to those who wish to study it, and prevent them from falling into errors, which it is difficult to avoid, from the engaging manner in which Rousseau drags along his readers.” Soon after the rapid success of his Village Conjuror, he published a Letter on French Music, or rather against French Music, written with equal freedom and liveliness. The exasperated partisans of French comedy treated him with as much fury as if he had conspired against the state; and a crowd of enthusiasts spent their strength and outcries against him. He was insulted, menaced, and lampooned.\n",
      "That interesting and tender style which is so conspicuous throughout the Village Conjuror, animates several letters in the Nouvelle Heloise, which was published in 1761 in 12mo. This epistolary romance, of which the plot is ill managed, and the arrangement bad, like most other works of genius, has its beauties as well as its faults. Some of the letters are indeed admirable, from the force and warmth of expression, from an effervescence of sentiment, and from the irregularity of ideas which always characterize a passion carried to its height. In the Heloise, Rousseau’s unlucky talent of rendering every thing problematical appears very conspicuous. This is the case in his arguments in favour of and against duelling, which afford an apology for suicide, and a just condemnation of it; his facility in palliating the crime of adultery, and his strong reasons to make it abhorred; his declamations against social happiness, and transports in favour of humanity; his violent rhapsodies against philosophers, and his rage for adopting their opinions; the existence of God attacked by sophistry, and atheists confuted by the most irrefragable arguments; the Christian religion combated by the most specious objections, and celebrated by the most sublime eulogies.\n",
      "His Emilius afterwards made more noise than the New Heloise. This moral romance, which was published in the year 1762, in four volumes 12mo, treats chiefly of education. Rousseau washed to follow nature in every thing; and though his system in several places differs from received ideas, it deserves in many respects to be put in practice, and with some necessary modifications it has been so. His precepts are expressed with the force and dignity of a mind frill of the leading truths of morality. If he has not always been virtuous, nobody at least has felt it more, or made it appear to greater advantage. What is most to be lamented is, that in wishing to educate a young man as a Christian, he has filled a volume with objections against Christianity. It must be confessed that he has given a very sublime eulogium on the gospel, and an affecting portrait of its divine Author; but the miracles and the prophecies, which serve to establish his mission, he attacks without reserve. Admitting only natural religion, he weighs every thing in the balance of reason; and this reason being false, leads him into dilemmas which are very unfavourable to his own repose and happiness. The French parliament condemned this book in 1762, and entered into a criminal prosecution against the author, which forced him to make a precipitate retreat. He directed his steps towards his native country, but it shut its gates upon him. Proscribed in the place where he had first drawn breath, he sought an asylum in Switzerland, and found one in the principality of Neufchatel. But the protection of the king of Prussia, to whom the principality belonged, was not sufficient to rescue him from that obloquy which the minister of Moutiers-Travers, the village to which he had retired, had excited against him. He preached against Rousseau, and his sermons produced an uproar amongst the people. On the night between the 6th and the 7th of September 1765, some fanatics, inspired by wine and the declamations of their minister, threw stones at the windows of the Genevan philosopher, who, fearing new insults, in vain sought an asylum in the canton of Berne. As this canton was connected with the republic of Geneva, they did not think proper to allow him to remain in their city, who was proscribed by that republic. Neither his broken state of health, nor the approach of winter, could soften the hearts of these obdurate Switzers. To prevent them from the fear they had of the spreading of his opinions, he in vain beseeched them to shut him up in prison till the spring. But even this favo\n",

      "----\n",
      "a very popular historian, the eldest son of Alexander Russell and Christian Ballantyne, was born in the year 1741 at Windydoors, a farm-house in the parish of Stowe and county of Selkirk. Most of the parish is within the limits of the county of Edinburgh. At an early age he was sent to school in the neighbouring village of Inverleithen, well known as a delightful place of summer resort. Here he acquired an elementary knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages; and private study afterwards enabled him to supply many of the deficiencies of his early education. In 1756 he was removed to Edinburgh, in order to be instructed in writing and arithmetic; and after having attended to these branches for about ten months, he was bound an apprentice to the bookselling and printing business for the term of five years. While engaged in this occupation, he discovered the utmost ardour in literary pursuits; nor was his situation unfavourable to the acquisition of useful and elegant knowledge.\n",
      "After the completion of his apprenticeship, he published a select collection of modern poems, which was favourably received. The first edition we have not seen; the second bears the subsequent title: “The select Poems of our most celebrated contemporary British Poets: viz. Dr Akenside, Mr Gray, Mr Mason, W. Shenstone, Esq. Mr W. Collins, Lord Lyttelton, Mess. Wartons, Mr Blacklock, Mr Beattie, Mr Ogilvie, etc. Vol.I. Second edition, with additions.” Edinb. 1764, 12mo. He afterwards congratulated himself on having contributed to extend the popularity of Gray and Shenstone in the northern part of the kingdom. It may be mentioned as a proof of his classical taste, that at this early period of life he entertained the highest admiration for the sublime odes of Gray, which he was accustomed to recite in a wild and enthusiastic manner. In the year 1763, while employed as a journeyman printer, he became a member of a literary association, denominated the Miscellaneous Society, which was composed of students and other young men anxious to exercise their talents and to improve their taste. This juvenile society included other individuals who afterwards rose to distinction. Among these we find Sir Robert Liston, who was employed in several important embassies, and Mr Dalzel, who became professor of Greek in this university.\n",
      "About the same period he made an attempt to adapt Crebillon’s Rhadamisthe el Zenobie to the English stage. The manuscript was submitted to the inspection of his two friends Liston and Dalzel; who, after a very careful perusal, stated not a few objections to particular passages, though they do not appear to have condemned the entire performance. This tragedy was at length offered to Garrick: but Murphy’s Zenobia was at that time in rehearsal; and if the merit of Russell’s play had been more conspicuous, it probably would not have been accepted. In 1764, he issued proposals for publishing a second volume of his collection of poems, which however did not make its appearance. With the view of arranging his materials, he now retired to the country, and about this period of his life he maintained an epistolary correspondence with Lord Elibank, Dr Ogilvie, and Mr Dalzel, by all of whom he seems to have been regarded as a young man of promising talents. In the course of the ensuing year, Lord Elibank, who was himself a man of literature, invited him to his seat in the county of Haddington, where he spent the greater part of the autumn, and had an opportunity of conversing with many distinguished individuals. To this nobleman he seems to have looked for favour and protection. The hope of obtaining preferment through his influence, had induced him to relinquish his original employment; and in the mean time he continued to prosecute his studies, particularly in the departments of history and polite literature.\n",
      "Having resided with his father till the month of May 1767, he proceeded to London in quest of honour and emolument. But his high hopes were speedily blasted; and after having in vain waited for advancement through the influence of Mr Hume, Lord Elibank, General Murray, and Governor Johnstone, he was under the necessity of contracting his views, and engaging himself as a corrector of the press in the great office of William Strahan, afterwards printer to his majesty. To find himself thus placed in a situation so inadequate to his expectations, must have cast a temporary gloom over his mind; but the freshness of youth, added to the natural vivacity of his mind, would have enabled him to support even greater disappointments. In some brief notices found among his papers after his death, he mentions his expectations of preferment through the interest of these individuals; but he does not aver that his hopes were founded on their promises. The disappointments of human life may very frequently be traced to the unreasonableness of our expectations.\n",
      "In the year 1769 he quitted the employment of Mr Strahan, and was engaged as overseer of the printing office of Brown and Adlard. During the same year he published an “Ode to Fortitude,” which was immediately reprinted at Edinburgh by his former masters, Martin and Wotherspoon. His “Sentimental Tales” appeared in 1770; and from this time he contributed to the periodical publications many essays in prose as well as verse. In 1772 he published a collection of “Fables, Moral and Sentimental,” and “An Essay on the Character, Manners, and Genius of Women, from the French of M. Thomas.” In 1774 he produced an octavo volume under the title of “Julia, a Poetical Romance.” Of this work, which is founded on the Nouvelle Heloise of Rousseau, neither the plan nor the execution can be commended. In the estimate of his literary character Russell dissented from the public opinion: his historical works, which have met with a very favourable reception, he considered as greatly inferior to his poetical works, which have been totally neglected. But his friends certainly had no reason to regret that the collective edition of his poems, which he long meditated, never made its appearance. On the death of Hume he produced an elegy which occasioned a sarcastic effusion from another poet. Mickle, who abhorred the scepticism of Hume, and who believed himself to have been materially injured by Smith, concludes his verses with this stanza:\n",
      "For him shall Russell rant and rave\n",
      "In hobbling rumbling lays;\n",
      "And Smith in barbarous sleepy prose\n",
      "Shall grunt and croak his praise.\n",
      "Russell is the author of the verses on the death of Dr Armstrong, subscribed W. R. and dated from Gray’s Inn, Sept. 10, 1779, which are commonly printed with the poems of that classical writer. Before this period he had apparently relinquished his connexion with the printing-office, and had entirely devoted himself to the pursuits of literature. His “History of America,” published in numbers, was completed in the course of the same year. This work was received with some degree of favour; hut the splendid merit of Dr Robertson’s history precluded all competition. During the same year, 1779, he likewise published, in octavo, the first two volumes of“The History of Modern Europe; with an account of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and a View of the Progress of Society from the fifth to the eighteenth century. In a Series of Letters from a Nobleman to his Son.” Their reception was so favourable as to exceed his most sanguine expectations. His studies experienced a temporary interruption in 1780, when he embarked for Jamaica in order to recover some money, due to him as the heir of his brother James, who, after a residence of several years, had died in that island. He afterwards resumed his historical labours, which were occasionally interrupted by his love of poetry. In the year 1783 he published “The Tragic Muse,” a poem addressed to Mrs Siddons. To address verses to a player has been considered as beneath the dignity of the literary character. It would be a crime, said a periodical writer, to sacrifice genius on such an uninteresting occasion: we have more dignified subjects for the poetic Muse than an individual whose excellence is only a dazzling meteor, and must be forgotten in a few years at most. Players have sometimes been extravagantly extolled, particularly by grateful or aspiring poets who have written for the stage, and it will doubtless be granted that a poet may easily find a more dignified theme: but supreme excellence in any ingenious art seems to be no improper subject of panegyric; and so rare and difficult are the fleeting attainments of a great actor, that it may be considered as a generous exertion of poetic talent to rescue them from oblivion.\n",
      "The three volumes which completed the History of Modern Europe made their appearance in 1784. From the manuscript notices to which we have already referred, it appears that in the composition of each of these five volumes he spent about twelve months. This work, which is the chief foundation of his reputation, possesses great merit as a popular view of a very extensive period of history. The author displays no inconsiderable judgment in the selection of his leading incidents, and in the general arrangement of his materials; and he seems to have studied the philosophy of history with assiduity and success. His narrative is always free from languor; and his reflections are conveyed in a lively and elegant style. It is however to be regretted that he should have adopted the useless expedient of exhibiting his work as a series of letters from a nobleman to his son: every reader is sufficiently aware that Dr Russell did not belong to the order of nobility; and the frequent recurrence of “my dear Philip,” is too apt to remind us of Lord Chesterfield. This work has very often been reprinted, and it still continues to maintain its original popularity. Russell closes his history with the peace of Paris in 1763. A continuation, extending to two volumes, was added by the late Dr Coote; and another write\n",

      "or the Great Desert, an immense tract of territory in Northern and Central Africa, the most desolate and terrible on the face of the globe. It is bounded on the north by the Barbary States; on the south by Soudan, or the countries watered by the upper course of the Niger, and by the Lower Senegal; and on the east it commences near the left bank of the Nile, and stretches westward to the shores of the North Atlantic Ocean, being nearly the whole breadth of Africa. Its actual extent may be stated as from the fifteenth to the thirtieth parallels of north latitude, and from the thirtieth of east to the fifteenth of west longitude. Its length is thus about three thousand miles, and its breadth is in some parts above a thousand miles. It is by many degrees the largest desert to be found in any part of the world, and it occupies about one fifth of the surface of this part of the globe. Sahara seems to be a table-land little raised above the level of the sea, covered with moving sands, and here and there containing some rocky heights, and valleys, or oases, where the water collects and nourishes thorny shrubs, ferns, and grass. From the defective cultivation of the surrounding countries, and the influence of the prevailing winds, the desert has always been gaining ground, so that in the east some of the Egyptian monuments of antiquity, which at the time of their erection were no doubt unencumbered by the sand, even at their bases, are now covered with it. In the south, likewise, it has encroached on the banks of the Niger and the Senegal; and on the north and north-west the southern provinces of Morocco have been partly usurped by it, so that the streams descending from the Atlas Mountains are either drunk up, or have their courses diverted so as to be rendered comparatively useless; while in the west it has, in some parts, extended a hundred miles into the sea, forming immense sandbanks, destructive to the formation of landing-places. The mountains along the Atlantic Ocean are in no continued chain, but rise up in isolated peaks, and through the open spaces between them the sand is drifted by the winds. Towards the interior they again lose themselves in a plain covered with white and sharp pebbles. From being frequently shifted by winds, the sand extends over the vast plain in a billowy or undulating manner, like the sea when agitated. In its nature it is quartzy and calcareous. The solid fixed rocks which occasionally rise above this mobile surface are sometimes extensive enough to form tracts of country. In the eastern part of the Sahara, the rocks are principally secondary, and for the most part limestone, sandstone, gypsum, and rock-salt, which occasionally appear to be traversed by trap-rocks. At Tegazza, and some other places, a sal-gem, whiter than the purest marble, lies in extensive strata under a bed of rock. Golberry informs us, that on its southern margin he found masses of native iron. The waters of the lakes which here and there occur in the desert are in some instances impregnated with carbonate of soda, in others with muriate of soda or common salt, forming the natron and salt lakes of travellers. The rocks on the seacoast of the Sahara, and the islands that lie along it, are said to be principally composed of igneous rock, and chiefly basalt.\n",
      "The principal production of Sahara is mineral salt, which, in many places, covers the surface in white glittering crystals, so that at a distance they appear to be rugged fields of snow or ice. This salt constitutes the staple article of the trade of Soudan, and Timbuctoo is indebted to this product of the waste for its existence as well as its prosperity.\n",
      "The most remarkable feature of this desolate ocean of sand consists in the oases or verdant islands which, at distant and dreary intervals, agreeably break its appaling uniformity. These are formed by springs, which, fed by distant mountains, burst forth amidst the desert solitudes, and, diffusing a partial verdure and fertility, form a strikingly beautiful contrast with the surrounding desolation. They are embellished with flowering shrubs of peculiar beauty. An aromatic plant resembling thyme, the same which bears the grains of zahara, acacias and other thorny shrubs, nettles, and brambles, constitute the ordinary vegetation of these places. Whole tracts are covered with forests of acacia, from which rich gums distil their odours; and groves of the date and lotus also occur, but more rarely. The fruits and berries which they yield constitute the food of whole tribes of men, while the verdure affords a support for animals chiefly of the antelope species. But lions, panthers, and serpents of enormous size, sometimes augment the horrors of these frightful solitudes. Ravens and other birds of prey are likewise often seen hovering over the track of the caravan, ready to dispute with the Moorish dogs for the carcasses of those who have perished in the desert. These oases are frequented by numerous flocks of ostriches, which feed on snails, lizards, and some coarse plants. For a great part of the year the dry and heated air has the appearance of a reddish vapour, and the horizon looks like the fire of a series of volcanoes. The rain, which descends from July to October or November, does not extend its precarious and momentary blessing to all the districts. In some of them rain does not fall for years together, on which occasions the springs also dry up, and a frightful want of water ensues, which drives men and animals to despair. The air during the day is oppressively hot, without a cloud to mitigate the glowing sunshine; and during the night it is disproportion-ally cool. The natural magic of the Fata Morgana, here often exhibited to the eye of the parched traveller, is pro-vokingly deceptive. Sometimes he sees in the distance what appears almost beyond question to be a sheet of water glittering in the sunbeams. He hastens forward, in hopes of soon allaying his thirst at the welcome lake; but his efforts to reach it are as vain as those of the child to clasp the rainbow. Still his fainting steps pursue, for still the imaginary lake lies before him as lovely and alluring, but as distant, as ever.\n",
      "It is of course only on the borders of the Sahara that oases on a great scale occur. In the eastern part they are extensive enough to form small kingdoms, generally dependent on some more powerful neighbour. In other parts, particularly the western, they consist merely of one or more detached villages, serving as emporia for the trade carried on by the caravans. And sometimes, especially as we penetrate into the interior of the desert, the oases are merely springs which nourish too scanty a vegetation to admit of inhabitants settling there, but affording supplies of water to the caravans, whose route is determined by the situation of these fountains. Dreary and encompassed with dangers as such abodes must be, every spot on which inhabitants can subsist is occupied; and notwithstanding the perils and sufferings of such travelling, regular journeys are performed across the whole breadth of this desolate region, from Morocco on the north to Timbuctoo on the south. The only animal fitted for traversing these solitudes as a beast of burden is the camel, which with equal truth and beauty has been designated the ship of the desert. By its patience of hunger and fatigue, by the provision which has been made for its carrying a large supply of water, and by the structure of its hoof, so formed as to glide smoothly over the level sand, it seems expressly designed by nature as a means of communication across these immense wastes The merchandise which they convey is firmly secured on their backs by means of creels and otherwise; and for the sake of mutual aid and defence, as well as to relieve the tedium of the route, they proceed in large bodies, occasionally amounting to the number of two thousand. The trade is carried on by merchants inured from their infancy to the hardships which attend such journeys. Their food consists of the milk of the camel, with barley-meal or Indian com, and a few dates, although the more opulent carry dried flesh and coffee. Water is conveyed in goat-skins, covered with tar for the purpose of preventing evaporation. The caravans, or akkabahs, as the Moors call them, do not proceed in a straight line to their journey’s end, but turn in various directions according to the position of the different oases. At each of these the travellers rest and refresh themselves for a day or two, and take in supplies of water. Two great evils are encountered in crossing the desert. The first and most terrible is, when from a peculiarly dry season one or more of the springs happens to fail; and the second is the burning wind, called the samoom, shoom, or simoom. Less than half a century ago a caravan consisting of two thousand persons and eighteen hundred camels, not finding water at the usual places, perished utterly, both men and animals. The vehemence of the wind, which is more like the breath of a furnace than the natural commotion of the atmosphere, raises and rolls before it the waves of red sand, causing the desert so much to resemble a stormy sea, that the Arabs have given it the name of “Bahar billa-maia,” or waterless sea.\n",
      "Major Denham relatés an instance of the terrible effects of the simoom. “The overpowering effect of a sudden sand-wind, w hen nearly at the close of the desert, often destroys a whole kafila, already weakened with fatigue. The spot was pointed out to us, strewed with bones and dried carcasses, where, the year before, fifty sheep, two camels, and two men, perished from thirst and fatigue, when within eight hours’ march of the well which we were anxiously looking for.”\n",
      "Captain Lyon thus describes the appearance of these dead bodies: “We observed many skeletons of animals which had died of fatigue on the desert, and occasionally the grave of some human being. All these bodies were so dried by the \n",

      "an inland county of England. It is bounded on the north by Cheshire and the Welsh counties of Flint and Denbigh; on the west by the Welsh counties of Denbigh, Montgomery, and Radnor; on the south by Herefordshire and Worcestershire; and on the east by Staffordshire. It is of an oblong figure, extending from north to south, and contains a variety of projections and indentations. Its greatest length is about forty-six, and its greatest breadth thirty-seven miles.

      "This county is divided into fifteen districts or hundreds, of which five are on the north-east side of the river Severn, three extend to both banks of that river, and the remainder are on its south-west side.

      "The face of the county is very much diversified. On the western side it has the wild appearance of the adjoining principality of Wales. Throughout the rest of the county the land is rather undulating, tolerably wooded, and with many beautiful rivulets meandering along the different valleys. The whole tract of country, from Wellington to the termination of the county between Oswestry and Chirk, exhibits the mild beauties of a fertile and cultivated district, enclosed by well-formed hedges into fields, of dimensions well calculated for advantageous husbandry, and ornamented with several domains of noblemen and gentlemen, which present a most pleasing succession of pictures to the traveller.\n",
      "That singular insulated mountain, the Wrekin, rising from a plain to the height of eleven hundred feet, exhibits its sugar-loaf form over the tops of the smaller elevations in its vicinity, and increases the interest of the scenery. In the southern division of the county, the Brown Clee Hill and the Titterson Clee Hill rise to greater elevations than the Wrekin, and produce much picturesque variety.\n",
      "In a county of such extent the soil must be very varied. On the eastern side, the valleys are flat and warm, and the soil generally of a sandy nature. In the middle part, the soil is most tenacious, and the bottoms of the wider valleys have frequently a stiff but rich clay. On the most western parts, the soil is very shallow, resting upon rocks of varied descriptions; and is better calculated for sheep-pasture than for producing grain. There are some moorlands, but enclosures and drainage have considerably diminished their extent. A very great portion of the soil rests on a limestone subsoil; and almost the whole of the plains are easy to work with light ploughs and two or three horses. The easterly wind generally prevails in the spring, and the westerly in autumn; but the former is more remarkable for regularity than the latter. The whole of the county enjoys a salubrious air; but on the hills, on the western side, the cold of winter is most intensely felt.\n",
      "The chief river is the Severn, which runs through the whole extent of the county from north-frest to south-east. It is navigable at all seasons to the Bristol Channel downwards, and in wet seasons upwards to Welshpool in Montgomeryshire. The navigation is, however, at all times impeded by many obstructions. In dry weather, the fords are only passable with difficulty, and in very wet weather the floods cover the banks, and extend so far over the level land on both sides, that the barges cannot be drawn up, from wanting a path on which the men who draw them can securely walk. It is one of the singularities of this navigation, that men are employed instead of horses, as on other rivers, to draw the vessels against the stream. Imperfect as this navigation is, it is, however, the chief source of the wealth of the county, as affording the means of conveying to good markets the various heavy productions which it yields. The fish found in the Severn, in its course through Shropshire, are salmon, pike, flounders, grayling, and eels. There are also some lampreys in the Shropshire part of the Severn, but they are less abundant than in the lower parts of the river. The principal tributary rivers are the Camlet, the Vyrnwey, the Tern, the Clun, the Ony, and the Teme. There are, besides, innumerable rivulets and streams, which adorn and fertilize the country. The lakes of Shropshire, though neither numerous nor extensive, form a variety in its landscapes rarely to be seen in the midland counties of England. Adjoining the town of Ellesmere is a beautiful lake of a hundred and sixteen acres, with some others smaller near it. On the western side of the county is Marton Pool, of forty-five acres. On the north of the Severn are Fennymere, Llynclyspool, and Ancot; and at Shrawardine is a fine lake of forty acres. That side of the county which most abounds in running streams has few or no lakes. The canals of this county, if not equal in extent to those ip some others, yield to none in their construction, or in the obstacles they have surmounted, or in the beneficial consequences by which they have been followed. The first canal was a private undertaking by a Mr Reynolds, completed in the year 1788, for the conveyance of his ironstone and coals. It was a short canal, but a descent of seventy-three feet was conducted by a well-contrived inclined plane and double railroad, by means of which the loaded boat passing down drew up another with a load nearly equal to one third of its own weight. This contrivance was found to be applicable to similar purposes upon a larger scale, and was speedily adopted by a company who, under the power of an act of parliament, soon constructed the Shropshire Canal, which passes through the most considerable iron and coal works, till it reaches the Severn. The Ellesmere Canal is a most important undertaking, as by it a communication is opened between the Severn and all the great canals and rivers in the north of England. Bristol and Liverpool are thus become connected by inland navigation; and the rivers Severn, Dee, Mersey, Trent, and Humber, are united for the purposes of conveyance. In districts where the inequalities of the surface would not admit of canals, iron railways have been constructed, on which heavy goods are conveyed, in appropriate waggons, with a great saving in the expense of carriage.\n",
      "There are few counties in which the agricultural business is, on the whole, better conducted than Shropshire. The land is very well adapted for the turnip cultivation, and the large flocks of sheep which are commonly fed on that valuable root a great part of the year, supply abundance of manure for the due cultivation of the different kinds of grain. The most prevailing breed of sheep are the Southdown, but many of the New Leicesters are to be seen, and in the hilly parts of the county are many of the fine-woolled Welsh sheep. The meadows on the banks of the Severn, and on the flat lands contiguous to the smaller streams, afford pasturage for numerous cows, whose milk, when converted into cheese, is commonly sold under the denomination of Cheshire. The corn generally cultivated is either wheat, barley, oats, or pease, and the crops on an average equal in productiveness those of the best districts of the kingdom. Hops are grown in small quantities upon that part of the county which adjoins to Herefordshire.\n",
      "Some small portions of land are appropriated to the growth of hemp and flax. The cultivation of potatoes has been very much extended of late years, and now furnishes a large proportion of the aliment of the labouring part of the population. The growth of hay, and the cultivation of artificial grasses, are more neglected than any other branch of rural economy. On the flat lands, the deposits from the overflowing of the streams sufficiently enrich them without any artificial manure; but from the embankments being neglected, the hay produced on such situations is liable to be much injured by the floods that frequently occur in summer.\n",
      "A great portion of the wealth of this county consists in the mineral productions, which are most profusely found beneath its surface. The chief of these are lead, iron, limestone, freestone, pipe-clay, and coals. The lead is procured in considerable quantities, chiefly from the mi\n",

      "a Phoenician philosopher and historian, who is said to have flourished before the Trojan war, and about the time of Semiramis. Of this most ancient writer the only remains extant are various fragments of cosmogony, and of the history of the gods and first mortals, preserved by Eusebius and Theodoret, both of whom speak of Sanchoniatho as an accurate and faithful historian; and the former adds, that his work, which was translated by Philo-Byblius from the Phoenician into the Greek language, contains many things relating to the history of the Jews which deserve great credit, both because they agree with the Jewish writers, and because the author received these particulars from the annals of Hierombalus, a priest of the god Jao.\n",
      "Several modern writers of great learning, however, have called in question the very existence of Sanchoniatho, and have contended, with much plausibility, that the fragments which Eusebius adopted as genuine upon the authority of Porphyry, were forged by that author or by the pretended translator Philo, from enmity to the Christians, and that the Pagans might have something to show of equal antiquity with the books of Moses. These opposite opinions have produced a controversy that has filled volumes, and of which our limits would hardly admit of an abstract. We shall therefore in few words state what appears to us to be the truth, and refer such of our readers as are desirous of fuller information to the works of the authors mentioned below.^[1. Bochart, Scaliger, Vossius, Cumberland, Dodwell, Stillingfleet, Mosheim’s Cudworth, and Warburton. ]\n",
      "The controversy respecting Sanchoniatho resolves itself into two questions: First, was there in reality such a writer? and, second, was he of the very remote antiquity which his translator claims for him?\n",
      "Now that there was really such a writer, and that the fragments preserved by Eusebius are indeed parts of his history, interpolated perhaps by the translator, we are compelled to believe by the following reasons.^[2. Of these indeed there are several proofs. Philo makes Sanchoniatho speak of Byblus as the most ancient city of Phoenicia, which, in all probability, it was not. We read in the book of Judges of Berith or Berytus, the city where Sunchoniatho himself lived; but not of Byblus, which was the native city of Philo, and to which he is therefore partial. He makes him likewise talk of the Greeks at a period long before any of the Grecian states were known or probably peopled. ] Eusebius, who admitted them into his work as authentic, was one of the most learned men of his age, and a diligent searcher into antiquity. His conduct at the Nicene council shows, that on every subject he thought for himself, neither biassed by authority on the one side, nor carried over by the rage of innovation on the other. He had better means than any modern writer can have of satisfying himself with respect to the authenticity of a very extraordinary work, which had then but lately been translated into the Greek language, and made generally known; and there is nothing in the work itself, or at least in those parts of it which he has preserved, that could induce a wise and good man to obtrude it upon the public as genuine, had he himself suspected it to be spurious. Too many of the Christian fathers were indeed credulous, and ready to admit the authenticity of writings without duly weighing the merits of their claim; but then such writings were always believed to be favourable to the Christian cause, and inimical to the cause of Paganism. That no man of common sense could suppose the cosmogony of Sanchoniatho favourable to the cause of revealed religion, further proof cannot be requisite than what is furnished by the following extract.\n",
      "“He supposes, or affirms, that the principles of the universe were a dark and windy air, or a wind made of dark air, and a turbulent evening chaos; and that these things were boundless, and for a long time had no bound or figure. But when tins wind fell in love with his own principles, and a mixture was made, that mixture was called desire or cupid (πoθoς).\n",
      "“This mixture completed, was the beginning of the (χτιoεως ) making of all things. But that wind did not know its own production; and of this with that wind was begotten Mot, which some call Mua, others the putrefaction of a watery mixture. And of this came all the seed of this building, and the generation of the universe.\n",
      "“But there were certain animals which had no sense, out of which were begotten intelligent animals, and were called Zophesemin, that is, the spies or overseers of heaven; and were formed alike in the shape of an egg. Thus shone out Mot, the sun and the moon, the less and the greater stars.\n",
      "“And the air shining thoroughly with light, by its fiery influence on the sea and earth, winds were begotten, and clouds and great defluxions of the heavenly waters. And, when all these things first were parted, and were separated from their proper place by the heat of the sun, then all met again in the air, and dashed against one another, and were broken to pieces, whence thunders and lightnings were made; and at the stroke of these thunders the fore-mentioned intelligent animals were awakened, and frighted with the sound, and male and female stirred in the earth and in the sea. This is the generation of animals.”\n",
      "After these things Sanchoniatho goes on to say, “These things are written in the Cosmogony of Taautus, and in his memoirs; and out of the conjectures and surer natural signs which his mind saw, and found out, and wherewith he has enlightened us.”\n",
      "Afterwards declaring the names of the winds north and south, and the rest, he makes this epilogue: “But these first men consecrated the plants shooting out of the earth, and judged them gods, and worshipped them; upon whom they themselves lived, and all their posterity and all before them; to these they made their meat and drink offerings.” Then he concludes: “These were the devices of worship, agreeing with the weakness and want of boldness in their minds.”\n",
      "Let us suppose Eusebius to have been as weak and credulous as the darkest monk in the darkest age of Europe, a supposition which no man will make who knows any thing of the writings of that eminent historian, what could he see in this senseless jargon, which even a dreaming monk would think of employing in support of Christianity? Eusebius calls it, and calls it truly, direct atheism; but could he imagine that an ancient system of atheism would contribute so much to make the Pagans of his age admit as divine revelations the books of the Old and New Testaments, that he should be induced to adopt, without examination, an impudent forgery, not two hundred years old, as genuine remains of the most remote antiquity?\n",
      "If this Phoenician cosmogony be a fabrication of Porphyry, or of the pretended translator, it must surely have been fabricated for some purpose; but it is impossible for us to conceive what purpose either of these writers could have intended to serve by forging a system so extravagantly absurd. Porphyry, though an enemy to the Christians, was not an atheist, and would never have thought of making an atheist of him whom he meant to obtrude upon the world as the rival of Moses. His own principles were those of the Alexandrian Platonists; and had he been the forger of the works which bear the name of Sanchoniatho, instead of the incomprehensible jargon about dark wind, evening chaos, Mot, the overseers of heaven in the shape of an egg, and animation proceeding from the sound of thunder, we should doubtless have been amused with refined specula tions concerning the operations of the Demiurgus and the other persons in the Platonic Triad.\n",
      "Father Simon of the oratory imagines,^[3. Bib. Crit. vol. i. p. 140. ] that the purpose for which the history of Sanchoniatho was forged, was to support Paganism, by taking from it its mythology and allegories, which were perpetually objected to it by the Christian writers. But this learned roan totally mistakes the matter. The primitive Christians were too much attached to allegories themselves to rest their objections to Paganism on such a foundation. What they objected to that system was, the immoral stories told of the priests. To this the pagan priests and philosophers replied, that these stories were only mythological allegories, which veiled all the great truths of theology, ethics, and physics. The Christians said this could not be; for that the stories of the gods had a substantial foundation in fact, these gods being only dead men deified, who in life had like passions and infirmities with other mortals. This, then, was the objection which the forger of the works of Sanchoniatho had to remove, if he really forged them in support of Paganism; but instead of doing so he gives the genealogy and history of all the greater gods, and shows that they were men deified after death for the exploits, some of them grossly immoral, which they had performed in this world. We have elsewhere (see Polytheism ) given his account of the deification of Chrysos, and Ouranos, and Gé, and Hypsistos, and Muth.; but our readers may not perhaps be ill pleased to accompany him through the history of Ouranos and Kronus, two of his greatest gods; whence it will appear how little his writings are calculated to support the tottering cause of Paganism against the objections which were then urged to it by the Christian apologists.\n",
      "“Ouranos,” says he, “taking the kingdom of his father, married Gé, his sister, and by her had four sons; Ilus, who is called Kronus; Betylus; Dagon, who is Siton, or the god of corn; and Atlas. But by other wives Ouranos had much issue, wherefore Gé, being grieved at it and jealous, reproached Ouranos, so as they parted from each other. But Ouranos, though he parted from her, yet by force invading her, and lying with her when he listed, went away again; and he also attempted to kill the children he had by her. Gé also often defen\n",

      "one of the most remarkable characters that is to be met with in all the records of biography, was, according to her own confession, the son of Anne countess of Macclesfield by the Earl of Rivers, and was born in 1698. This confession of adultery was made in order to procure a separation from her husband the Earl of Macclesfield; yet, having obtained this desired end, no sooner was her spurious offspring brought into the world, than, without the dread of shame or poverty to excuse her, she discovered the resolution of disowning him, and, as long as he lived, treated him with the most unnatural cruelty. She delivered him over to a poor woman to educate as her own; prevented the Earl of Rivers from leaving him a legacy of L.6000, by declaring him dead; and in effect deprived him of another legacy which his godmother Mrs Lloyd had left him, by concealing from him his birth, and thereby rendering it impossible for him to prosecute his claim. She endeavoured to send him secretly to the plantations; but this plan being either laid aside or frustrated, she placed him apprentice with a shoemaker. In this situation, however, he did not long continue; for his nurse having died, he went to take care of the effects of his supposed mother, and found in her boxes some letters which discovered to young Savage his birth, and the cause of its concealment.\n",
      "From the moment of this discovery it was natural for him to become dissatisfied with his situation as a shoemaker. He now conceived that he had a right to share in the affluence of his real mother; and therefore he directly, and perhaps indiscreetly, applied to her, and made use of every art to awaken her tenderness and attract her regard. But in vain did he solicit this unnatural parent. She avoided him with the utmost precaution, and took measures to prevent his ever entering her house on any pretence whatever.\n",
      "Savage was at this time so touched with the discovery of his birth, that he frequently made it his practice to walk before his mother’s door in hopes of seeing her by accident; and often did he warmly solicit her to admit him to see her; but all to no purpose. He could neither soften her heart nor open her hand.\n",
      "In the mean time, whilst he was assiduously endeavouring to rouse the affections of a mother in whom all natural affection was extinct, he was destitute of the means of support, and reduced to the miseries of want. We are not told by what means he got rid of his obligation to the shoemaker, or whether he ever was actually bound to him; but we now find him very differently employed in order to procure a subsistence. In short, the youth had parts, and a strong inclination towards literary pursuits, especially poetry. He wrote a poem, and afterwards two plays, Woman’s a Riddle, and Love in a Veil; but the author was allowed no part of the profits from the first; and from the second he received no other advantage than the acquaintance of Sir Richard Steele and of Mr Wilkes, by whom he was pitied, caressed, and relieved. However, the kindness of his friends not affording him a constant supply, he wrote the tragedy of Sir Thomas Overbury, which not only procured him the esteem of many persons of wit, but brought him in L.200. The celebrated Aaron Hill was of great service to him in correcting and fitting this piece for the stage and the press; and he extended his patronage still further. But Savage was, like many other wits, a bad manager, and was ever in distress. As fast as his friends raised him out of one difficulty, he sunk into another; and, when he found himself greatly involved, he would ramble about like a vagabond, with scarcely a shirt to his back.\n",
      "Mr Hill also earnestly promoted a subscription to a volume of Miscellanies by Savage, and likewise furnished part of the poems of which the volume was composed. To this miscellany Savage wrote a preface, in which he gives an account of his mother’s cruelty in an uncommon strain of humour. The profits of his tragedy and his Miscellanies together had now, for a time, somewhat raised poor Savage both in circumstances and in credit; so that the world just began to behold him with a more favourable eye than formerly, when both his fame and his life were endangered by a most unhappy event. A drunken frolic in which he one night engaged, ended in a fray, and Savage unfortunately killed a man, for which he was condemned to be hanged. His friends earnestly solicited the mercy of the crown, whilst his mother as earnestly exerted herself to prevent his receiving it. The Countess of Hertford at length laid his whole case before Queen Caroline, and Savage obtained a pardon.\n",
      "Savage had now lost that tenderness for his mother which the whole series of her cruelty had not been able wholly to repress; and considering her as an implacable enemy, whom nothing but his blood could satisfy, threatened to harass her with lampoons, and to publish a copious narrative of her conduct, unless she consented to allow him a pension. This expedient proved successful; and the Lord Tyrconnel, upon his promise of laying aside his design of exposing his mother’s cruelty, look him into his family, treated him as an equal, and engaged to allow him a pension of L.200 a year. This was the golden part of Savage’s life. He was courted by all who endeavoured to be thought men of genius, and caressed by all who valued themselves upon a refined taste. In this gay period of his life he published the Temple of Health and Mirth, on the recovery’ of Lady Tyrconnel from a languishing illness; and The Wanderer, a moral poem, which he dedicated to Lord Tyrconnel, in strains of the highest panegyric. But these praises he in a short time found himself inclined to retract, being discarded by the man on whom they were bestowed. Of this quarrel Lord Tyrconnel and Mr Savage assigned very different reasons. Our author’s known character pleads too strongly against him; for his conduct was ever such as made all his friends, sooner or later, grow weary of him, and even forced most of them to become his enemies.\n",
      "Being thus once more turned adrift upon the world, Savage, whose passions were very strong, and whose gratitude was very small, became extremely diligent in exposing the faults of Lord Tyrconnel. He, moreover, now thought himself at liberty to take revenge upon his mother, in a poem called The Bastard. This poem had an extraordinary sale; and its appearance happening when his mother was at Bath, many persons there took frequent opportunities of repeating passages from the Bastard in her hearing.\n",
      "Some time after this, Savage formed the resolution of applying to the queen. With this view, he published a poem on her birth-day, which he entitled the Volunteer-Laureat; for which she was pleased to send him L.50, with an intimation that he might annually expect the same bounty. But this annual allowance was nothing to a man of his strange and singular extravagance. His usual custom was, as soon as he had received his pension, to disappear with it, and secrete himself from his most intimate friends, till every shilling of the L.50 was spent; which done, he appeared again, pennyless as before. But he would never inform any person where he had been, or in what manner his money had been dissipated. From the reports, however, of some, who found means to penetrate his haunts, it would seem that he expended both his time and his cash in the most sordid and despicable sensuality.\n",
      "His wit and parts, however, still raised him new friends as fast as his behaviour lost him his old ones. Yet such was his conduct, that occasional relief only furnished the means of occasional excess; and he defeated all attempts made by his friends to fix him in a decent way. He was even reduced so low as to be destitute of a lodging, insomuch that he often passed his nights in those mean houses that are set open for casual wanderers; sometimes in cellars, amidst the riot and filth of the most profligate of the rabble; and not seldom would he walk the streets till he was weary, and then lie down in summer on a hulk, or in winter with his associates among the ashes of a glass-house.\n",
      "Yet, amidst all this penury and wretchedness, had this man so much pride, and so high an opinion of his own merit, that he was always ready to repress, with scorn and contempt, the least appearance of any slight or indignity towards himself, in the behaviour of his acquaintance, among whom he looked upon none as his superior. This life, unhappy as it may be imagined, was yet rendered more so by the death of the queen in 1738, which stroke deprived him of all hopes from the court. His pension was discontinued, and the insolent manner in which he demanded of Sir Robert Walpole to have it restored, for ever cut off this considerable supply.\n",
      "His distress became now so great and so notorious, that a scheme was at length concerted for procuring him a permanent relief. It was proposed that he should retire into Wales, with an allowance of L.50 per annum, on which he was to live privately in a cheap place, for ever quitting his town haunts, and resigning all further pretensions to fame. This offer he seemed gladly to accept; but his intentions were only to deceive his friends, by retiring for a while, to write another tragedy, and then to return with it to London in order to bring it upon the stage.\n",
      "In 1739 he set out in the Bristol stage-coach for Swansey, and was furnished with fifteen guineas to bear the expense of his journey. But, on the fourteenth day after his departure, his friends and benefactors, the principal of whom was Mr Pope, who expected to hear of his arrival in Wales, were surprised with a letter from Savage, informing them that he was yet upon the road, and could not proceed for want of money. There was no other method than a remittance, which was sent him, and by the help of which he was enabled to reach Bristol, whence he was to proceed to Swansey by water. At Bristol, however, he found an embargo laid upon the\n",

      "are institutions established by act of parliament, for the safe custody of small sums deposited by the industrious classes, and for the accumulation of such sums at compound interest. The origin of savings banks is comparatively recent. Attempts at instituting such banks were made, on a small scale, at various places in England towards the end of last century and the beginning of the present: attempts of a private and isolated nature, without the benevolent individuals by whom they were made entertaining any idea of the institution ever becoming general; and it was reserved for an individual yet living to have the honour of founding an institution which served as a model for such banks, and thus of conferring an unspeakable blessing on the operative classes. We refer to the Rev. Dr Duncan, minister of Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire. In 1810 he established “the Parish Bank Friendly Society of Ruthwell and during the same year published a pamphlet on the subject, entitled “An Essay on the Nature and Advantages of Parish Banks.” This pamphlet, in which the nature and advantages of these institutions are ably developed, had so great an effect, and the success of the Ruthwell institution had been so remarkable, that “Parish Banks,” as Dr Duncan called them, but which are now described as Savings Banks, speedily sprung up, not only in most of the principal towns and boroughs of Scotland, but in several remote parishes.\n",
      "Savings banks in England and Ireland were first taken under the protection of government by the act of 57th Geo.\n",
      "III. cap. 62, passed in 1817; but the first act in support of these institutions in Scotland did not pass till two years afterwards. A savings bank in Scotland, established under the latter act, is an institution formed by any number of persons who may choose to unite for the purpose of receiving deposits of small sums, and who, upon enrolling their rules at the quarter-sessions, acquire the privilege of suing and being sued in the name of trustees. The money and effects of the institution are vested in the trustees, for behoof of the depositors. Receipts and other documents used by the bank are exempted from stamp-duties; and provision is made by the act for a summary mode of settling disputes that may arise between the trustees and depositors. These were all the advantages which the act conferred on savings banks in Scotland. Hence these institutions did not flourish; the aggregate sums deposited in them at the period (1835) when the privileges of the English system were extended to Scotland not being estimated higher than L.100,000.\n",
      "Various acts were meanwhile passed for the support of these institutions in England and Ireland; but all these statutes were consolidated in the existing English Savings Bank Act of 9th Geo. IV. cap. 92, passed in 1828, which was amended in a few particulars by the act of 3d Will.\n",
      "IV. cap. 14. These acts, as previously stated, were extended to Scotland in 1835.\n",
      "By this statute the whole deposits may be invested in the Bank of England on account with the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, at the rate of L.3. l6s. 0½d. per cent. of interest. The savings banks are thus enabled to give a comparatively high rate of interest, which is generally L.3. 6s. 8d., or 3i per cent. Each individual is allowed to deposit any sum from one shilling up to L.30 in a year, and L.150 in all, exclusive of interest; and, including interest, L.200. The bank is obliged to allow compound interest; and this interest must be made up by law at the end of every year (20th November), and added to the amount belonging to each depositor, even though he does not appear to get his book balanced. The bank is also authorized to receive the funds of friendly societies without limitation, and of benevolent and charitable institutions to the amount of L.300 in all. By this statute the whole funds are required to be invested with the Na tional Debt Commissioners, and nowhere else; and any part of these funds, when required, is repaid by the Bank of England, without regard to fluctuations in the value of the public stocks. It likewise requires security to be given by every person—the treasurer, the actuary, the cashier, the clerks, the office-keeper—intrusted with the receipt or custody of any sum of money belonging to a savings bank; while neither these functionaries, nor the managers or trustees, nor any person having a control or direction in the management, can become depositors in the bank, or derive, directly or indirectly, any benefit from the institution. Annual returns must be made to the National Debt Office, and likewise suspended in the office of the bank, and exhibited to depositors; the manager and trustees being thus directly responsible both to the government and to the public. In short, while the greatest facilities are afforded for the increase of the funds, every possible precaution has been taken to insure their safe custody, and the direct responsibility of the managers. Nay, so liberal is the system, that the annual general meeting is open by law to depositors of the amount of L.10; but, practically speaking, every depositor who chooses is allowed to attend. Besides, the rules and regulations of every savings bank require to be approved by the Commissioners of the National Debt, and certified by the barrister-at-law appointed for the purpose, and enrolled at the quarter-sessions of the justices of the peace for the county in which the bank is situated. It may here be mentioned, that, to prevent an abuse of the institution, no person is allowed by law to be a depositor in two savings banks at the same time; and on joining a savings bank, every person is required to sign a declaration to that effect.\n",
      "The act 2d and 3d Will. IV. enables depositors in savings banks, and others, to purchase government annuities, for life or for a given number of years, and either immediate or deferred. At present these annuities are limited to L.20 a year. The money advanced is returned (but without interest), provided the contracting party does not live to the age at which the annuity is to become payable, or is unable to continue the monthly or annual instalments. The transactions under the act are to be carried on through the medium of savings banks, or by societies established for the purpose. But of this scheme, the classes for whose benefit it was intended have not availed themselves to any great extent.\n",
      "Since their establishment in 1817, the increase of savings banks has been beyond all expectation. The total sum of money invested by these institutions in England, Wales, and Ireland, amounts at this moment (1841) to upwards of L.22,000,000 sterling; while in Scotland, since 1835, when the English law on the subject was extended to that part of the united kingdom, the progress has also been very considerable; savings banks having been established in most of the principal towns; while, in many places, such institutions still exist, and are flourishing, under the meagre and defective statute of 1819. The National Security Savings Bank of Edinburgh was founded in April 1836; and on the 20th November 1841, after the lapse of only five years and a half, it had accumulated L.22l,816. l9s. 0d., including interest; while the aggregate number of depositors was no fewer than 19,130, of whom 16,149 had balances (including interest) in their favour not exceeding L.20 each. Of this bank, 107 charitable societies, whose united deposits amounted to L.5215. 1s. 2d., had availed themselves; and sixty-two friendly societies, whose gross deposits amountcd to L.2l6,585. l3s. 5d.\n",
      "The object and principle of this great national institution cannot be too highly commended. In London, and many other parts of England, public banks do not receive small deposits, and upon none do they pay any interest. And even in Scotland, where the public banks allow interest on deposits, they are not willing to open an account under L.10. But few poor persons are able to save so large a sum, except by a lengthened course of economy. The truth therefore is, that, until savings banks were established, the poor were everywhere without the means of securely and profitably investing those small sums which they are not unfrequently in a condition to save, and were consequently led, from the difficulty of disposing of them, to neglect opportunities of making savings, or, if they did make them, were tempted by the offer of high interest to lend them to persons of doubtful character and desperate fortune, by whom they were for the most part squandered. Under such circumstances, it is plain that nothing could be more important in the way of diffusing habits of forethought and economy among the labouring classes than the establishment of savings banks, where the smallest sums are placed in perfect safety, are accumulated at compound interest, and are paid, with their accumulations, the moment they are demanded by the depositors.\n",
      "But, notwithstanding the soundness of these views, various objections have been stated against these institutions. To a few only of these objections can we at present allude.\n",
      "It has, for example, been objected to savings banks that the money depositcd in them being sent to London and invcsted in national stock, is withdrawn from the spot where it was saved, and that thereby that spot is impoverished in proportion to the amount of the sum thus transferred. This objection is more specious than solid. In the first place, nine tenths of the money invested in savings banks would not be saved at all, but spent as it is earned, if these institutions did not exist. The savings bank does not transmit to London money already saved. It causes money to be saved which otherwise would have been spent. It may be said to create money; and it is only the fund which it creates that it transmits to London and invests in national stock. But, in the second place, no man is obliged to put his money into a savings bank, and thus t\n",

      "an instrument which serves to cut into pieces several solid matters, as wood, stone, ivory, and the like.\n",
      "The best saws are of tempered steel ground bright and smooth; those of iron are only hammer-hardened. Hence the first, besides their being stiffer, are likewise found smoother than the last. They are known to be well hammered by the stiff bending of the blade; and to be well and evenly ground, by their bending equally in a bow.\n",
      "The lapidaries, too, have their saw, as well as the workmen in mosaic; but of all mechanics, none have so many saws as the joiners, the chief of which are the following. The pit-saw, which is a large two-handed saw, employed for sawing timber in pits, and chiefly used by the sawers. The whip-saw, which has likewise two handles, used in sawing such large pieces as the hand-saw will not easily reach. The hand-saw is made to be used by an individual, of which there are different kinds, as the frame-saw, which is furnished with cheeks. By the twisted cords which pass from the upper parts of these cheeks, and the tongue in the middle of them, the upper ends are drawn close together, and the lower set farther asunder. The tenon-saw, which being very thin, has a back to keep it from bending. The compass-saw, which is very small, and its teeth usually not set. Its use is to cut a round, or any other compass-kerf, on which account the edge is made broad, and the back thin, that it may have a compass to turn in.\n",
      "At an early period, the trunks of trees were split with wedges into as many and as thin pieces as possible; and if it were necessary to have them still thinner, they were hewn on both sides to the proper size. This simple and wasteful manner of making boards has been still continued in some places to the present day. Peter the Great of Russia endeavoured to put a stop to it, by forbidding hewn dales to be transported on the river Neva. The saw, however, though so convenient and beneficial, has not been able to banish entirely the practice of splitting timber used in building, or in making furniture and utensils; and indeed it must be allowed that this method is attended with peculiar advantages which that of sawing can never possess. The wood-splitters perform their work more expeditiously than sawers, and split timber is much stronger than that which has been sawn: for the fissure follows the grain of the wood, and leaves it whole; whereas the saw, which proceeds in the line chalked out for it, divides the fibres, and by these means lessens its cohesion and solidity. Split timber, indeed, turns out often crooked and warped; but for many purposes to which it is applied this is not injurious, and these faults may sometimes be amended. As the fibres, however, retain their natural length and direction, thin boards particularly can be bent much better. This is a great advantage in making pipe-staves, or sieve-frames, which require still more art, and in forming various implements of a similar kind.\n",
      "Our common saw, which requires only to be guided by the hand, however simple it may be, was not known to the inhabitants of America when they were subdued by the Europeans. The inventor of this instrument has been inserted in their mythology by the Greeks, with a place, in which, amongst their gods, they honoured the greatest benefactors of the earliest ages. By some he is called Talus, and by others Perdix. None except Pliny make Daedalus the inventor; but Hardouin, in the passage where this occurs, reads Talus for Daedalus. Talus is the name of the inventor according to Diodorus Siculus, Apollodorus, and others. He was the son of Daedalus’s sister, and was by his mother placed under the tuition of her brother, to be instructed in his art. Having found the jaw-bone of a snake, he employed it to cut through a small piece of wood, and by these means was induced to fabricate a similar instrument of iron, that is, to make a saw. This invention, by which labour is greatly facilitated, excited the envy of his master, and prompted him to put Talus privately to death. Being asked, when burying the body, what he was depositing in the earth, he replied, a serpent. This ambiguous answer discovered the murder; and thus a snake was the cause of the invention, of the murder, and of its being brought to light. By others the inventor is called Perdix, who is supposed to have been the son of a sister of Daedalus. Perdix did not employ the jaw-bone of a snake for a saw', but the back-bone of a fish, as is mentioned by Ovid.\n",
      "The saws of the Grecian carpenters had the same form, and wore made with equal ingenuity as the same instruments at present. This appears from a painting preserved among the antiquities of Herculanum. Two genii are represented at the end of a bench consisting of a long table resting on two four-footed stools, and the piece of wood to be sawn through is secured by cramps. The saw with which the genii arc at work bears a striking resemblance to our frame-saw'. It consists of a square frame, having a blade in the middle, the teeth of which are perpendicular to the plane of the frame. The piece of wood to be sawn extends beyond the end of the bench, and one of the workmen appears standing, and the other sitting on the ground. The arms in which the blade is fastened have the same form as that which is given to them at present. In the bench are seen holes, in which the cramps holding the timber are stuck. They are shaped like the figure 7; and the ends of them reach below the boards which form the top of it.\n",
      "Saw -Mills. The most beneficial improvement of the operation of sawing was the invention of saw-mills, which are driven either by water or by wind. Mills of the first kind were erected in Germany, on the small river Ruer, as early as the fourth century. The art of cutting marble with a saw is very ancient. According to Pliny, it was invented in Caria. Stones of the soap-rock kind, which are softer than marble, were sawn at that period; but it appears that the harder kinds of stone were also then sawn; for we are informed of the discovery of a building which was encrusted with cut agate, carnelian, lapis lazuli, and amethysts. There is, however, no account in any of the Greek or Roman writers of a mill for sawing wood; and as modern authors speak of saw-mills as new and uncommon, it appears that the oldest construction of them has been forgotten, or that some interesting improvement has made them appear entirely new.\n",
      "Becher says that saw-mills were invented in the seventeenth century, which is a mistake; for when the Infant Henry sent people to settle in the island of Madeira, discovered in 1420, he gave orders for saw-mills to be erected, for the purpose of sawing into deals the various species of excellent timber with which the island abounded, and which were afterwards exported to Portugal. There was a sawmill in the city of Breslau about the year 1427, producing a yearly rent of three merks; and in 1490, the magistrates of Erfurt purchased a forest, in which they erected a sawmill, besides renting another in the neighbourhood. The first saw-mill in Norway was erected about the year 1530. In the year 1552 there was a saw-mill erected at Joachimethal, the property of a mathematician called Jacob Geusen. In 1555, the Bishop of Ely, ambassador from Queen Mary of England to the court of Rome, having seen a saw-mill in the vicinity of Lyons, the writer of his travels gave a particular description of it. The first saw-mill was erecte<l in Holland at Saardam in 1596, the invention of which is ascribed to Cornelius Cornelissen. The first mill of this kind in Sweden was erected in the year 1653.\n",
      "In England, saw-mills had at first a similar effect with printing in Turkey, the ribbon-loom in the dominions of the church, and the crane at Strasburg. When attempts were made to introduce them, they were violently opposed, because it was apprehendcd that the sawers would thus be deprived of the means of procuring subsistence. An opulent merchant in 1767 or 1768, by desire of the Society of Arts, caused a saw-mill to be erected at Limehouse, driven by wind; but it was demolished by the mob, and the damage was sustained by the nation, while some of the rioters were punished. This, however, was not the only mill of the kind then in Great Britain; for at Leith there was one driven by wind some years before. Saw-mills are very common in America, where the moving power is generally water. Some have been constructed on a very extensive plan.\n",
      "The mechanism of a sawing-mill may be reduced to three principal things. The first is, that the saw is drawn up and down as long as is necessary, by a motion communicated to the wheel by water. The second is, that the piece of timber to be cut into boards is advanced by an uniform motion to receive the strokes of the saw; for here the wood is to meet the saw, and not the saw to follow the wood, therefore the motion of the wood and that of the saw ought immediately to depend the one on the other. The third is, that where the saw has cut through the whole length of the piece, the whole machine stops of itself, and remains immoveable; lest having no obstacle to surmount, the moving power should turn the wheel with too great velocity, and break some part of the machine.\n",
      "When a completely cylindrical pillar is to be cut out of one block of stone, the first thing will be to ascertain in the block the position of the axis of the cylinder, then lay the block so that such axis shall be parallel to the horizon, and let a cylindrical hole of from one to two inches diameter be bored entirely through it. Let an iron bar, whose diameter is rather less than that of this tube, be put through it, having just room to slide freely to and fro as occasion may require. Each end of this bar should terminate in a screw, on which a nut and frame may be fastened.

      "was bom on the 19th of December 1742, at Stralsund, where his father had kept a shop. When he was very young, he received the usual instructions of a private school; and was afterwards advanced to an academy. At a very early age he showed a strong desire to follow the profession of an apothecary, and his father suffered him to gratify his inclinations. With Mr Bauch, an apothecary at Gottenburg, he served his apprenticeship, which was completed in six years. He remained, however, some time longer at that place, and it was there that he so excellently laid the foundations of his knowledge. Among the various books which he read that treated of chemical subjects, Kunckell’s Laboratory seems to have been his favourite. He used to repeat many of the experiments contained in that work privately in the night, when the rest of the family had retired to rest. A friend of Scheele’s had remarked the progress which he had made in chemistry, and had asked him by what inducements he had at first been led to study a science in which he had gained such knowledge. Scheele replied, “The first cause, my friend, arose from yourself. Nearly at the beginning of my apprenticeship you advised me to read Neuman’s Chemistry, from the perusal of which I became eager to make experiments myself; and I remember very well how I mixed together, in a conserve-glass, oil of cloves and fuming acid of nitre, which immediately took fire. I see also still before my eyes an unlucky experiment which I made with pyrophorus. Circumstances of this kind did but the more inflame my desire to repeat experiments.” After Scheele’s departure from Gottenburg in the year 1765, he obtained a place with Kalstrom, an apothecary at Malmo Two years afterwards he went from thence to Stockholm, and managed the shop of Mr Scharenberg. In 1773, he changed this appointment for another at Upsal, under Mr Loock. Here he was fortunately situated, as, from his acquaintance with learned men, and from having free access to the university laboratory, he had opportunities of increasing his knowledge. At this place also he happily commenced the friendship which subsisted between him and Bergman. During his residence at this place, Prince Henry of Prussia, accompanied by the Duke of Sudermania, visited Upsal, and chose this opportunity to see the academical laboratory. Scheele was accordingly appointed by the university to exhibit to them some chemical experiments. This office he undertook, and showed some of the most curious processes in chemistry. The two princes asked him many questions, and expressed their approbation of the answers which he returned to them. The duke asked him of what country he was, and seemed to be much pleased when Scheele informed him that he was born at Stralsund. At their departure they told the professor, who was present, that they should esteem it a favour if he would permit the young man to have free access to the laboratory as often as he chose to make experiments.\n",
      "In the year 1777 Scheele was appointed by the Medical College to be apothecary at Koping. It was at that place that he soon showed the world how great a man he was, and that no place or situation could confine his abilities. When he was at Stockholm he showed his acuteness as a chemist, as he discovered there the new and wonderful acid contained in the fluor spar. It has been confidently asserted that Scheele was the first who discovered the nature of the aerial acid, and that whilst he was at Upsal he made many experiments to prove its properties. This circumstance might probably have furnished Bergman with the means of treating this subject more fully. At the same place he began the series of excellent experiments on that remarkable mineral substance manganese; from which investigation he was lcd to make the very valuable and interesting discovery of oxymuriatic acid. At the same time he examined the properties of ponderous earth.\n",
      "At Koping he finished his Dissertation on Air and Fire; a work which the celebrated Bergman most warmly recommended in the friendly preface which he wrote for it. The theory which Scheele endeavours to prove in this treatise is, that fire consists of pure air and phlogiston. According to more recent opinions, if inflammable air be phlogiston, water is composed of these two principles. Of these opinions we may say, in the words of Cicero, “Opiniones tam variae sunt tamque inter se dissidentes ut alterum profecto fieri potest ut earum nulla, alterum certe non potest ut plus una vera sit.” The author’s merit in this work, exclusive of the encomiums of Bergman, was sufficient to obtain the approbation of the public; as the ingenuity displayed in treating so delicate a subject, and the many new and valuable observations which are dispersed through the treatise, justly entitled the author to that fame which his book procured him. It was spread abroad throughout every country, became soon out of print, and was reprinted, and translated into many languages. The English translation is enriched with the notes of that accurate and truly philosophical genius Mr Richard Kirwan.\n",
      "Scheele now diligently employed himself in contributing to the Transactions of the Academy at Stockholm. He first pointed out a new way to prepare the salt of benzoin. In the same year he discovered that arsenic, freed in a particular manner from phlogiston, partakes of all the properties of an acid, and has its peculiar affinities to other substances.\n",
      "In a Dissertation on Flint, Clay, and Alum, he clearly overturned Beaumé’s opinion of the identity of the siliceous and argillaceous earths. He published an Analysis of the Human Calculus. He showed also a mode of preparing mercurius dulcis in the humid way, and improved the process of making the powder of algaroth. He analysed the mineral substance called molybdena, or flexible black lead. He discovered a beautiful green pigment. He showed us how to decompose the air of the atmosphere. He discovered that some neutral salts are decomposed by lime and by iron. He decomposed plumbago, or the common black lead. He observed, with peculiar ingenuity, an acid in milk, which decomposes acetated alkali; and in his experiments on the sugar of milk, he discovered another acid, different in some respects from the above-mentioned acids and the common acid of sugar. He accomplished the decomposition of tungsten, the component parts of which were before unknown, and found in it a peculiar metallic acid united to lime. He published an excellent dissertation on the different sorts of ether. He found out an easy way to preserve vinegar for many years. His investigation of the colouring matter in Prussian blue, the means he employed to separate it, and his discovery that alkali, sal ammoniac, and charcoal, mixed together, will produce it, are strong marks of his penetration and genius. He found out a peculiar sweet matter in expressed oils after they have been boiled with litharge and water. He showed how the acid of lemons may be obtained in crystals. He found the white powder in rhubarb, which Model thought to be selenite, and which amounts to one seventh of the weight of the root, to be calcareous earth united to the acid of sorrel. This suggested to him the examination of the acid of sorrel. He precipitated acetate of lead with it, and decomposed the precipitate thus obtained by the vitriolic acid, and by this process he obtained the common acid of sugar; and by slowly dropping a solution of fixed alkali into a solution of the acid of sugar, he regenerated the acid of sorrel. From his examination of the acids contained in fruits and berries, he found not one species of acid alone, viz. the acid of lemon, but also another, which he denominated the malaceous or malic acid, from its being found in the greatest quantity in apples.\n",
      "By the decomposition of Bergman’s new metal, siderite, he showed the truth of Meyer’s and Klaproth’s conjecture concerning it. He boiled the calx of siderite with alkali of tartar, and precipitated nitrate of mercury by the middle salt which he obtained by this operation. The calx of mercury which was precipitatcd was found to be united to the acid of phosphorus, so that he demonstrates that this calx was phosphoretted iron. He found also that the native Prussian blue contained the same acid. He discovered, by the same means, that the perlate acid, as it was called, was not an acid sui generis, but the phosphoric united to a small quantity of the mineral alkali. He suggested an improvement in the process for obtaining magnesia from Epsom salt; and he advises the adding of an equal weight of common salt to the Epsom salt, so that an equal weight of Glauber’s salt may be obtained; but this will not succeed unless during the cold of winter. These are the valuable discoveries of this great philosopher, which are to be found in the Transactions of the Royal Society at Stockholm. Most of his essays have been published in French by Madame Pi-cardet and M. Morveau of Dijon. Dr Beddoes also has made a very valuable present to his countrymen of an English translation of a great part of Scheele’s dissertations, to which he has added some useful and ingenious notes.\n",
      "Viewing Scheele as a philosopher, we must judge of him from his many and important discoveries. What concerns him as a man we are informed of by his friends, who affirm that his moral character was irreproachable. It was matter of remark, that his chemical apparatus was neither neat nor convenient; his laboratory was small and confined; nor was he particular in regard to the vessels which he employed in his experiments, so that we may justly wonder how such discoveries and such experiments could have been made. He understood none of the modem languages except the German and Swedish; and he had not the advan- tage of being benefited by the early intelligence of discoveries made by foreigners, but was forced to wait till the intelligence was conveyed to him in the slow and uncertain channel o\n",

      "an eminent restorer of learning, was born at Dundee in the year 1506. He traced his descent from the ancient family of the Scrim-zeours of Dudhope, who obtained the office of hereditary standard-bearers to the kings of Scotland in 1057.\n",
      "At the grammar-school of Dundee our author acquired the Greek and Latin languages in an uncommon degree of perfection, and that in a shorter time than many scholars of his age. At the university of St Andrews, his successful application to philosophy gained him great applause. The next scene of his studies was the university of Paris, and their more particular object the civil law. Two of the most famous civilians of that age, Eguinard Baron and Francis Duaren,^[1. “Francis Duaren was the first of the French civilians who purged the chair in the civil law schools from the barbarisms of the Glossaries, in order to introduce the pure sources of the ancient jurisprudence. As he did not desire to share that glory with any one, he looked with an envious eye on the reputation of his colleague Eguinard Baron, who also mixed good literature with the knowledge of the law. This jealousy put him upon composing a work, wherein he endeavoured to lessen the esteem that people had for his colleague. The maxim, Pascitur in vivis livor; post fata quiescit, was verified remarkably in him; for after the death of Baron, he showed himself most zealous to eternize his memory, and was at the expense of a monument to the honour of the deceased.” (See the Translation of Bayle's Dictionary, of 1710, p. 1143-4.) ] were then giving lectures to crowded audiences at Bourges. The fame of these professors occasioned his removal from Paris; and for a considerable time he prosecuted his studies under their direction. At Bourges he had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the celebrated James Amiot, Greek professor in that city, well known in the learned world by his translation of Plutarch’s Lives, and distinguished afterwards by his advancement to great honours in the church, and finally to the rank of cardinal. Through the recommendation of this eminent person, Mr Scrimzeor engaged in the education of two young gentlemen of the name of Bucherel, whom he instructed in the belles lettres, and other branches of literature calculated to qualify them for their station in life.\n",
      "This connection introduced him to Bernard Bornetel, bishop of Rennes, a person famed in the political world for having served the state in many honourable embassies. Accepting an invitation from this prelate to accompany him to Italy, Mr Scrimzeor greatly enlarged the sphere of his literary acquaintance, by his conversation and connection with most of the distinguished scholars of that country. The death of Francis Spira^[2. Francis Spira was a lawyer of great reputation at Cittadella, in the Venetian state, about the beginning of the sixteenth century. He had imbibed the principles of the Reformation, and was accused before John (de la Casa, archbishop of Benevento, the pope's nuncio at Venice. He made some concessions, and asked pardon of the papal minister for his errors. But the nuncio insisted on a public recantation. Spira was exceedingly averse to this measure; but at the pressing instances of his wife and friends, who represented to him that he must lose his practice and ruin his affairs by persisting against it, he at last complied. Shortly afterwards he fell into a deep melancholy, lost his health, and was removed to Padua for the advice of physicians and divines. But his disorders augmented, and the recantation, which he said he had made from cowardice and interest, filled his mind with continual horror and remorse, insomuch that he sometimes imagined that he felt the tormentβ of the damned. No means being found to restore either his health or his peace of mind, in 1548 he fell a victim to his miserable situation. See Collyer's Dictionary, art. Spira. ] happened during his visit to Padua; and as the character and conduct of this remarkable person engaged at that time the attention of the world, Mr Scrimzeor is said to have collected memoirs of him in a publication entitled The Life of Francis Spira, by Henry of Scotland. This performance, however, does not appear in the catalogue of his works.\n",
      "After he had stored his mind with the literature of foreign countries, and satisfied his curiosity as a traveller, it was his intention to revisit Scotland. He might without vanity have entertained hopes, that the various knowledge which he had treasured up would win him a partial reception among his countrymen. An ambition of being usefully distinguished among them as a man of letters is justly supposed to have been the principal motive of his return; but the most sanguine projects of life are often strangely diverted by accident, or rather perhaps are invisibly turned by Providence from their natural course. Mr Scrimzeor, on his journey homewards, had to pass through Geneva. His fame had long forerun his footsteps. The syndics and other magistrates, on his arrival, requested him to set up the profession of philosophy in that city, promising a compensation suitable to the exertion of his talents. He accepted the proposal, and established the philosophical chair.\n",
      "After he had taught for some time at Geneva, a fire broke out in the neighbourhood, by which his house was consumed, and he himself reduced to great distress. His pupils, the Bucherels, however, had not forgotten their obligations to him, and sent a considerable sum of money to his relief.\n",
      "At this time flourished at Augsburg the famous mercantile family of the Fuggers. Ulric Fugger was then its representative; a man possessed of prodigious wealth, passionately fond of literature, a great collector of books and manuscripts, and a munificent patron of learned men. Being informed, by means of his literary correspondence, of the misfortune which had befallen Mr Scrimzeor in the burning of his house, he immediately sent him a pressing invitation to accept an asylum beneath his roof until his affairs should be re-established. Mr Scrimzeor gladly availed himself of such hospitable kindness, and lost no time in repairing to Germany.\n",
      "Whilst residing at Augsburg with Mr Fugger, he was much employed in augmenting his patron’s library, by vast collections purchased from every corner of Europe. Codices of the Greek and Latin authors were then of inestimable value, and seem to have been more particularly the object of Mr Scrimzeor’s researches.\n",
      "When his manuscripts were ready for the press, he was desirous of returning to Geneva to print them. His patron. Fugger, recommended him for that purpose to the learned\n",
      "Henry Stephens, one of his pensioners, and at that time the most celebrated printer in Europe.\n",
      "Immediately on his arrival at Geneva, 1563, he was earnestly solicited by the magistrates to resume the chair of philosophy. Notwithstanding his compliance, and consequently the dedication of much of his time to the study of physics, he, two years afterwards, instituted a course of lectures in the civil law, and had the honour of being its first founder and professor at Geneva.\n",
      "As soon as he had settled again in this city, he hoped, amidst his other occupations, to prosccute the great object of his literary fame, the printing of his various works. But a suspicion which Henry Stephens entertained, that it was his intention to set up a rival press at Geneva, occasioned great dissensions between them; and the result of the quarrel was, that the republic of letters, during Scrimzeor’s life, was deprived of his valuable productions. At his death most of them fell into the hands of Isaac Casaubon, who has been accused of publishing considerable portions of them as his own.\n",
      "Some account of Mr Scrimzeor’s several performances will serve to convey an idea of his extensive erudition.\n",
      "He wrote critical and explanatory notes upon Athenaeus’s Deipnosophists, or Table Conversations of Philosophers and Learned Men of Antiquity, having first collated several manuscripts of his author. This work Casaubon published at Leyden in 1600, but without distinguishing his own notes from those of Scrimzeor.\n",
      "A Commentary and Emendations of the Geography of Strabo were among our author’s literary remains. These were published in Casaubon’s Parisian edition of Strabo in 1620. Henry Stephens, from an idea of justice due to Scrimzeor’s literary fame, notwithstanding the violent animosity which had subsisted between them, reproaches Casaubon for adopting, without acknowledgment, the Scottish critic’s lucubrations on Strabo. Dempster assures us, that Scrimzeor, in his manuscript letters, mentions his design of publishing this performance; and hence it is probable that his work appeared to himself of considerable consequence, and had taken up much of his attention. Although Casaubon, in his ample notes exhibited at the foot of Strabo’s text, makes no confession of having derived any thing from Scrimzeor, it must not be concealed, that in an epistle to Sir Peter Young, the nephew of the critic through whom the Commentary and Emendations of Strabo came into his hands, Casaubon acknowledges how very useful to him they might be made; for, speaking there of his intended edition of Strabo, he says, “It cannot be expressed how much assistance I may obtain from your notes of Scrimzeor.”\n",
      "Edward Herrison, a Scottish author, in his Commentary on Plutarch’s Book concerning the Inconsistencies of the Stoics, informs us that Scrimzeor collated different manuscripts of all the works of Plutarch. This undertaking appears sufficient to occupy half the life of an ordinary critic. Every one knows how voluminous an author was the philosopher, the historian, and the orator of Chaeronea. Whether the learned critic meant to publish an edition of Plutarch’s works is not known; but such an intention seems higly probable, from this laborious enterprise of collating them.\n",

      "son of Dr Lewis Atterbury, was born at Milton in Buckinghamshire, in 1662; educated at Westminster; and thereafter elected to Christ Church in Oxford, where he soon distinguished himself by his fine genius and taste for polite literature. In 1687 he was made Μ. A., when he exerted himself in the controversy with the papists; vindicated Luther in the strongest manner; and showed an uncommon fund of learning, enlivened with great vivacity. In 1690 he married Miss Osborn, a distant relation of the duke of Leeds, and a lady of great beauty, but of small fortune.\n",
      "In February 1690 and 1691 we find him resolved to “bestir himself in his office in the house,” that of censor probably; an officer peculiar to Christ Church, who presides over the classical exercises. At the same time he held the catechetical lecture founded by Dr Busby.\n",
      "It must have been about this period that he took orders, and entered upon another scene and another sort of conversation; for in 1691 he was elected lecturer of St Bride’s Chyrch in London, and preacher at Bridewell Chapel. An academic life, indeed, must have been irksome and insipid to a person of his active and aspiring temper. It was hardly possible that a clergyman of his fine genius, improved by study, and with a spirit to exert his talents, should remain long unnoticed; and accordingly we find that he was soon appointed chaplain to King William and Queen Mary.\n",
      "The share which he took in the controversywith Bentley, about the genuineness of Phalaris’s epistles, is now very clearly ascertained. In one of the letters to his noble pupil, dated Chelsea 1698, he says, the matter had cost him some time and trouble. “In laying the design of the book, in writing above half of it, in reviewing a good part of the rest, in transcribing the whole, and attending the press, he adds, “half a year of my life went away.”\n",
      "In 1700 a still larger field of activity opened, in which Atterbury was engaged four years with Dr Wake (afterwards archbishop of Canterbury) and others concerning the rights, powers, and privileges of convocations ;' an investigation in which, however the truth of the question may. be supposed to lie, he displayed so much learning and ingenuity, as well as zeal for the interests of his order, that the lower house of convocation returned him their thanks, and the university of Oxford complimented him with the degree of D.D. On the 29th January 1700’he was installed archdeacon of Totness, being promoted to that dignity by Sir Jonathan Trelawney, then bishop of Exeter. The same year he was engaged, with some other learned divines, in revising an intended edition of the Greek Testament, with Greek scholia, collected chiefly from the fathers by Mr Archdeacon Gregory. At this period he was very popular as preacher at the Rolls Chapel; an office which had been conferred on him by Sir John Trevor, a great discerner of abilities, in 1698, when he resigned Bridewell, which he had obtained in 1693. Upon the accession of Queen Anne in 1702, Dr Atterbury was appointed one of her majesty’s chaplains in ordinary; and in October 1704 he was advanced to the deanery of Carlisle. About two years after this he was engaged in a dispute with Mr Hoadly concerning the advantages of virtue with regard to the present life, occasioned by his sermon preached 30th August 1706, at the funeral of Mr Thomas Bennet, a bookseller. In 1707 Sir Jonathan Trelawney, then bishop of Exeter, appointed him one of the canons residentiaries of that church. In 1709 he was engaged in a fresh dispute with Mr Hoadly concerning the doctrine of passive obedience, occasioned by his Latin sermon, entitled Concio ad Clerum Londinensem, habita in Ecclesia S. Elphegi. In 1710 came on the famous trial of Dr Sacheverell, whose remarkable speech on that occasion was generally supposed to have been drawn up by our author, in conjunction with Dr Smalridge and Dr Freind. The same year Dr Atterbury was unanimously chosen prolocutor of the lower house of convocation, and had the chief management of affairs in that house. On the 11th May 1711 he was appointed by the convocation one of the committee for comparing Mr Whiston’s doctrines with those of the church of England; and in June following he had the chief hand in drawing up A liepresentation of the Present State of Religion. In 1712 Dr Atterbury was made dean of Christ Church, notwithstanding the strong interest and warm applications of several great men in behalf of his competitor Dr Smalridge. The next year saw him at the summit of his preferment, as well as of his reputation; for, in the beginning of June 1713, the queen, on the recommendation of Lord Chancellor Harcourt, advanced him to the bishopric of Rochester, with the deanery of Westminster in commendam. He was confirmed on the 4th July, and consecrated at Lambeth the next day. . .\n",
      "In the beginning of the succeeding reign his tide of prosperity began to turn; and he received a sensible mortification presently after the coronation of King George I., when, upon his offering to present to his majesty, with a view, no doubt, of standing better in his favour, the chair of state or royal canopy, his own perquisite as dean of Westminster, the tender was rejected, not without some evident marks of dislike to his person.\n",
      "During the rebellion in Scotland, and after the Pretender s declaration had been widely distributed, the archbishop of Canterbury, and the bishops in or near London, drew up and published a Declaration of their abhorrence of the present Rebellion, and an Exhortation to the Clergy and People to be zealous in the discharge of their Duties to His Majesty King George; but the bishop of Rochester refused to sign it, and engaged Bishop Smalridge to join in the refusal, on account of some reflections it contained against the high church party. In fact he appeared generally among the protestors against the measuιes of the king’s ministers, and for the most part drew up the reasons of the protests with his own hand.\n",
      "In 1716 we find him advising Dean Swift in the management of a refractory chapter. On the 26th April 1/22 he sustained a severe trial in the loss of his lady, .by whom he had four children. In this memorable year, also, on a suspicion of his being concerned in a plot in favour of the Pretender, he was apprehended (24th August), and committed prisoner to the Tower. This commitment of a bishop upon suspicion of high treason, as it was a thing rarely practised since the Reformation, so it occasioned various speculations, which amused the nation at that time; and men, as usual, judged of things by tlae standard of their own affections and prejudices.\n",
      "On the 23d March 1723 a bill was brought into the house of commons for inflicting certain pains and penalties on Francis, Lord Bishop of Rochester, a copy of which was sent to him, with notice that he had liberty of counsel and solicitors for making his defence. Under these circumstances the bishop applied by petition to the house of lords for their direction and advice as to his conduct in this conjuncture; and on the 4th April he acquainted the speaker of the house of commons, by letter, that he was determined to give that house no trouble in relation to the bill depending therein, but should be ready to make his defence against it when it should be argued in another house, of which he had the honour to be a member. On the 9th the bill passed the house of commons, and was the same day sent up to the house of lords for their concurrence.\n",
      "May the 6th being the day appointed by the lords for the first reading of the bill, Bishop Atterbury was brought to Westminster to make his defence. The proceedings continued above a week; and, on May the llth, he was permitted to plead for himself. This he did in a very eloquent speech, which he feelingly opens by complaining of the uncommon severity he had experienced in the tower, and which had been carried to so great a length that not even his son-in-law Mr Morice was permitted to speak to him in any other way than by standing in an open area, whilst the bishop looked out of a two-pair-os-stairs window. On the 13th he was carried for the last time from the tower in order to hear the reply of the king’s counsel to his defence. On the 15th the bill was read a third time, and, after a very long and warm debate, passed on the 16th by a majority of 83 to 43. On the 27th the king came to the house and confirmed it by his royal assent. On the 18th June 1723 this eminent prelate, having the day before taken leave of his friends, who, from the time of the passing of the bill against him till the day of his departure, had free access to him in the tower, embarked on board the Aldborough man-of-war, and landed the Friday following at Calais. When he went on shore, being informed that Lord Bolingbroke (who, after the rising of the parliament, had received the king’s pardon), was arrived at the same place on his return to England, he said, with an air of pleasantry, “Then I am exchanged.” And it was, in the opinion of Mr Pope expressed on the same occasion, a sign that the nation was afraid of being overrun with too much politeness, when it could not regain one great man but at the expense of another. The severity of the bishop’s treatment did not cease with his banishment; the same vindictive spirit pursued him even in foreign climes; and no British subject was permitted to visit him without the king’s sign manual, which Mr Morice was always obliged to solicit, not only for himself, but for every one of his family whom he carried abroad with him, for which the fees of office were very high.\n",
      "When Bishop Atterbury first entered upon his banishment, Brussels was the place destined for his residence; but, by the arts and instigation of the British ministers, he was compelled to leave that city, and retire to Paris. There, being solicited by the friends of the Pretender to enter into their négociations, he changed his abode for Montpelier in 1728; and after\n",

      "an author celebrated for the accuracy of his mathematical and mechanical investigations, and considered particularly happy in the clearness of his explanations, and the elegance of his experimental illustrations, was born in the early part of the year 1746. He was educated at Westminster school, where he was admitted in 1759. Six years afterwards he was elected off to Trinity College, Cambridge. He took his degree of bachelor of arts in 1769, with the rank of third wrangler; Dr Parkinson of Christ’s College being senior of the year. This distinction was amply sufficient to give him a claim to further advancement in his own college, on the list of which he stood the foremost of his contemporaries; and in due time he obtained a fellowship, and was afterwards one of the tutors of the college. He became master of arts in 1772, and in 1776 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London.\n",
      "The higher branches of the mathematics had, at this period, been making some important advances at Cambridge, under the auspices of Dr Waring, and many of the younger members of the university became diligent labourers in this extensive field. Mr Atwood chose for his peculiar department the illustration of mechanical and experimental philosophy, by elementary investigations and ocular demonstrations of their fundamental truths. He delivered, for several successive years, a course of lectures in the observatory of Trinity College, which were very generally attended and greatly admired. In the year 1784 some circumstances occurred which made it desirable for him to discontinue his residence at Cambridge; and soon afterwards Mr Pitt, who had become acquainted with his merits by attending his lectures, bestowed on him a patent office, which required but little of his attendance, in order to have a claim on the employment of his mathematical abilities in a variety of financial calculations, to which he continued to devote a considerable portion of his time and attention throughout the remainder of his life.\n",

      "It may be very truly asserted that several of these works of Mr Atwood have materially contributed to the progress of science, by multiplying the modes of illustration which experimental exhibitions afford for the assistance of the instructor; at the same time they can scarcely be said to have extended very considerably the bounds of human knowledge, or to have demonstrated that their author was possessed of any extraordinary talent or energy of mind in overcoming great difficulties or in inventing new methods of reasoning. The Analysis of a Course of Lectures has been little read; and it bears evident marks of having been composed before Mr Atwood had acquired a habit of accurate reasoning on physical subjects. In the first page, for example, the forces of cohesion and gravitation are completely confounded; and in the third we find the idea of perfect spheres touching each other in a greater or less number of points, notwithstanding the appearance of precision which the author attempts to maintain in his language.\n",
      "The object of the paper on Pefiectiοη is, to illustrate and improve the construction of Hadley’s quadrant; and Mr Atwood proposes, for some particular purposes in practical astronomy, two new arrangements of the speculums, by which the rays are caused to move in different planes, and which he considers as affording greater accuracy for the measurement of small angles than the common form of the instrument, although not of general utility, nor very easily adjusted for observation.\n",
      "The treatise on Pectilinear Motion and Potation exhi  bits a good compendium of the elementary doctrines of mathematical mechanics; but it shows a great deficiency in the knowledge of the higher refinements which had been introduced into that science by Daniel Bernoulli, and Euler, and Lagrange. The properties of simply accelerated and retarded motion are first discussed, and the phenomena of penetration experimentally examined; the laws of varying forces are then investigated, and the properties of the pendulum demonstrated; the vibrations of an elastic chord are calculated, “considering the whole mass to be concentrated in the middle point,” as an approximation; and then, instead of imitating and simplifying the elegant but complicated demonstrations of the continental mathematicians, the author most erroneously repeats, in the words of Dr Smith, the exploded doctrine, that “the string, during any instant of its vibration, will coincide with the harmonic curve.” The subject of a resistance, varying as the square of the velocity, is next examined; and some useful experiments on the descent of bodies in water are stated in confirmation of the theory. On this occasion, the author observes, with regard to the formation of the different strata of the earth, that bodies disposed to break into large masses, though specifically lighter, may easily have descended more rapidly through a fluid, than denser but more brittle bodies, so that the natural order of densities may thus have become inverted. He next examines the theory of rotation, and relates some very interesting experiments on rectilinear and rotatory motions; and he shows that Emerson and Desaguliers were totally mistaken in asserting that “the momentum produced is always equal to the momentum which produces it.” The last section of the work, which is devoted to the subject of free rotation, is the most elaborate of the whole; but it exhibits no material extension of the earlier investigations of the Bernoullis and Professor Vince; nor does it contain the important proposition of Segner, relating to the existence of three axes of permanent rotation, at right angles to each other, in every body, however irregular.\n",
      "Notwithstanding these partial objections, the work may still, in many respects, be considered as classical. The paper on Watch-balances is principally intended to show the advantages which may be obtained, in Mr Mudge’s construction, from the effect of subsidiary springs in rendering the vibrations isochronous, their actions being limited to certain portions of the arc of motion. If the author has here again omitted to follow the continental mathematicians in some of their refinements of calculation, it must be confessed that his view of the subject has, in this instance, not only the advantages of simplicity, but also that of a nearer approach to the true practical state of the question, than is to be found in the more complicated determinations which had been the result of the labours of some of his predecessors.\n",
      ". But, whatever may be the merits of these investigations, they appear to be far exceeded in importance by the papers on Ships, the first of which obtained for its author the honour of a Copleian medal. Its principal object is to show how much the stability of a ship will commonly vary, when her situation with respect to the horizon is materially altered; and how far the assumptions of theoretical writers, respecting many others of the forces concerned in naval architecture, will generally differ from the true state of these forces when they actually occur in seamanship. In the second part of the investigation, some errors of Bouguer and of Clairbois are pointed out; and the theoretical principles of stability are exemplified by a detailed calculation, adapted to the form and dimensions of a particular vessel, built for the service of the East India Company.\n",

      "These form a range situate in the Atlantic Ocean, extending in an oblique line from north-west to south-east, between the 37th and 40th degrees of north latitude, and the 25th and 32d degrees of west longitude. It has been a subject of some controversy among geographers, to what quarter of the world they ought to be referred. Originally attached to Africa, they were afterwards, with evident impropriety, transferred to America, and are now more generally viewed as part of Europe, although their connection with and general resemblance to the other African groups rather incline us to adhere to the first arrangement.\n",
      "It does not appear that the ancients had any knowledge of the Azores, or of any group in this sea, except the Canaries, to which they finally applied the celebrated appellation of the Fortunate Islands. But the Arabian geographers, Edrisi and Ibn al Vardi, describe, after the Canaries, nine other islands, situate in the Western Ocean. That these were the Azores is rendered highly probable, by considering that their number is exactly nine, and that mention is made by these writers of the abundance of a species of eagle or hawk; a circumstance which afterwards appeared to the Portuguese so remarkable, that they derived the name of the islands from it. The climate in which they are placed also makes them north of the Canaries. Some other coincidences might be pointed out did our limits permit; and, upon the whole, we see no reason to doubt that the Azores are really the nine islands enumerated by the Arabians, although two of the number might probably be Madeira and Porto Santo, whilst the small islands of Corvo and Flores might remain unnoticed. The Arabian writers represent them as having been populous, and as having contained cities of some magnitude; but they state that the inhabitants had been greatly reduced by intestine warfare.\n",
      "The first European discovery of this group is claimed by the Flemings. The Portuguese, eagerly bent upon pursuing thcir career of navigation along the coast of Africa, did not readily turn into any other direction. A Flemish merchant, called Van der Berg, is reported, in sailing from Lisbon, to have been driven upon these shores. The intelligence soon reached the court of Lisbon, where it excited considerable interest. It is even said that Prince Henry went in person to examine the value of this new discovery. In 1459 the islands began to be planted and colonized, and in so fertile a soil the inhabitants rapidly multiplied. In 1466 Alphonzo V. is said to have granted them to his sister the Duchess of Burgundy, though in that case they must have soon reverted to the Portuguese crown. In 1580 they fell, with the other Portuguese territories, under the dominion of Spain.\n",
      "The Azores were at this time the grand rendezvous in the voyage homewards of the fleets, which came laden with the wealth of both the Indies. Hence they became a theatre of that maritime warfare which was carried on with such spirit by the English under Queen Elizabeth against the peninsular powers. In 1586 Sir Walter Raleigh equipped two pinnaces of 35 and 40 tons, the command of-which he gave to Captain Whiddon. Having taken two or three prizes, they fell in, off St Michael, with the great fleet of Spanish galleons, consisting of 24 sail, two of them caracks of 1000 or 1200 tons. They attacked them, however, without hesitation, hoping to cut off some straggling member of this great body. It will not surprise our readers that they were unable to make any impression upon it; but they retired without loss. In 1587 Sir Francis Drake, after having swept the harbour of Cadiz, sailed for the Azores, where he took an East India carack, richly laden, and the first that had ever fallen into the hands of the English. In 1589 the Earl of Cumberland fitted out a squadron, sailed for the Azores, and made numerous prizes.\n",
      "Under the active administration of Pombal, considerable exertions were made for the improvement of the Azores; but the stupid and bigoted government which followed rather tended to destroy these benefits, and to make the islands take a retrograde course.\n",
      "The Azores have of late attracted some attention as the theatre of contest between the parties contending for the crown of Portugal. The adherents of the constitution, who support against Miguel the rights of Maria da Gloria, obtained possession of Terceira, where they have succeeded in maintaining themselves. They have even by the latest accounts been able to occupy Fayal; but St Michael is still held by their adversaries.\n",
      "In giving a description of these islands, we shall begin with St Michael, the largest and most populous, and the one in which the peculiar physical structure of the Azores is exhibited on the greatest scale. It consists generally of a fertile plain, but diversified by an infinite variety of hills and mountains, all bearing evident marks of volcanic action. The centre of the island contains chiefly small conical hills; but the eastern and western quarters rise into lofty mountains, with deep valleys and lakes intervening. The face of the country is almost everywhere smiling; the plains are covered with luxuriant crops; vines and oranges grow on the hills; and even the mountains are adorned with myrtles, laurels, and other evergreen shrubs. All appears a paradise; nor could the observer at first suspect that this was a spot chosen, as it were, by nature for the display of all her most terrible phenomena. The form of the mountains, however, soon indicates their history. There are few which, after being moulded by the volcano, have not been rent by the earthquake. In some cases the chasm is so complete, that a level path has been formed between the severed members. One of the most remarkable appearances of this kind occurs in the Porto de Ilheo, a small island about a quarter of a mile from the harbour of Villa Franca. Here a volcanic rock, 2000 feet high, has been completely split, exhibiting a chasm 39 feet wide from the top, to seven feet below the surface of the water. It thus forms, for a few small vessels, a harbour perfectly safe from every vicissitude of the weather.\n",
      "In the year 1591 a most tremendous earthquake appears to have been felt all over the Azores, and to have shaken St Michael for twelve days without intermission. Since that period there is no record of a∏y such great convulsion, except one in 1757, of which we have no particulars, and it was probably much less formidable; nor are any of its volcanoes at present in a state of action. Hot springs abound in every part of the island, and from almost every crevice vapour is seen issuing. But the most remarkable phenomena are the Caldeiras or boiling fountains, which rise chiefly from a valley called the Furnas, near the western extremity of the island. The water ascends in columns to the height of about twelve feet, after which it dissolves in vapour, forming clouds of various shapes and colours. The heat is such as to boil an egg in two minutes, though the sulphureous impregnation unfits it for being employed in culinary purposes. The ground in the immediate vicinity is entirely covered with native sulphur, like hoar frost. At a small distance is a remarkable phenomenon called the Muddy Crater, the vertex of which, forty-five feet in diameter, is on a level with t 4 he plain. Its contents are in a state of violent and continual ebullition, accompanied with a sound resembling the waves of a tempestuous ocean. Yet they never rise above its level, unless occasionally to throw to a small distance a spray of the consistence of melted lead. The Furnas abound also in hot springs, some of which it is impossible to touch without being scalded. There is almost always, however, a cold spring near to the hot one, so that the water can be brought to any temperature that may be desired. These springs, after being long neglected, have, within the last half century, been greatly resorted to, and the cures performed in cases of palsy, rheumatism, and similar maladies, are said to have been very wonderful.\n",
      "St Michael is about 50 miles in length, and varies in breadth from about 5 to 12 miles. The plains are fertile in wheat, barley, and Indian corn; whilst vines and oranges grow luxuriantly on the sides of the mountains. They are made to spring even from the interstices of the volcanic rocks, which are sometimes blasted in order that they may receive the plants. Raised in this manner, these fruits are said to be of superior quality; but the great expense originally required in such a mode of cultivation confines it to persons of some capital. The western part of the island yields hemp, which might be raised to a considerable extent. There is also a mountain called Pico de Per, which appears to be rich in iron, though no means are at present employed for extracting the ore. The exports consist of wine, fruit, and provisions. Foreign intercourse used to be confined rigorously to Lisbon; but since the emigration of the court, the inhabitants have assumed the privilege of trafficking directly with England, America, and other countries. After defraying the expense of its local government, it yields L.28,000 of revenue to the mother country.\n",
      "lhe principal town ĩn the island is Ponta del Gada, which contains about 12,000 inhabitants. It is built with tolerable regularity, the streets being straight and broad, lhe religious edifices are numerous and elegant. They consist of two large convents of the orders of St Francis and St Augustin, four for professed nuns, and three re-colhimentos for such as are not professed. The harbour receives only small vessels: those of any magnitude must anchor in an open road, which, though not dangerous, cannot be occupied during the prevalence of southerly gales. It is, however, the best roadstead in the 1 ≡land. Ribeira Grande is also a large town on the south coast, containing nearly as many inhabitants as Ponta del Lada. It has two large convents, and there are \n",

      "a kingdom of Asia, and the most ancient in the world, being founded by Nimrod, the grandson of Ham, who also, according to the Bible, founded Nineveh, the capital of the kingdom of Assyria. The country was bounded on the north by the desert part of Mesopotamia, on the east by the Tigris, on the south by the Persian Gulf, and on the west by the Arabian desert. The confines of the kingdom, however, were at times much more extensive.\n",
      "Passing over the early portion of Babylonian history, which is obscure and doubtful, we shall limit ourselves to a short account of the events which terminated in the subversion of the kingdom.\n",
      "War had been begun between the Medes, Persians, and Babylonians, in the reign of Neriglissar, the father of Nabonadius, which had been carried on with very bad success on the side of the Babylonians. Cyrus, who commanded the Median and Persian army, having subdued the several nations inhabiting the great continent from the AEgean Sea to the Euphrates, bent his march towards Babylon. Nabonadius, hearing of his march, immediately advanced against him with an army. In the engagement which ensued, the Babylonians were defeated; and the king, retreating to his metropolis, was blocked up and closely besieged by Cyrus. The reduction of this city was no easy enterprise. The walls were of a prodigious height, the number of men employed to defend them was great, and the place was stored with all sorts of provisions for twenty years. Cyrus, despairing of being able to take such a city by storm, caused a line of circumvallation to be drawn quite round it, with a large and deep ditch; reckoning that if all communication with the country were cut off, the besieged would be obliged to surrender through famine. That his troops might not be too much fatigued, he divided his army into twelve bodies, appointing each body its month to guard the trenches; but the besieged, looking upon themselves as out of all danger by reason of their high walls and magazines, insulted him from the ramparts, and looked upon all the trouble he gave himself as so much unprofitable labour.\n",
      "After Cyrus had spent two whole years before Babylon, without making any progress in the siege, he at last thought of the following stratagem, which put him in possession of it He was informed that a great annual solemnity was to be held at Babylon, and that the inhabitants on that occasion were accustomed to spend the whole night in drinking and debauchery. This he therefore thought a proper time for surprising them; and accordingly sent a strong detachment to the head of the canal leading to the great lake, with orders, at a certain time, to break down the great bank which was between the lake and the canal, and to turn the whole current into the lake. At the same time he stationed one body of troops at the place where the river entered the city, and another where it came out; ordering them to march in by the bed of the river as soon as they should find it fordable. Towards the evening he opened the head of the trenches on both sides of the river above the city, that the water might discharge itself into them; by which means, and the breaking down of the great dam, the river was soon drained. Then the two bodies of troops above-mentioned, according to their orders, entered the channel, the one commanded by Gobryas and the other by Ga-dates; and finding the gates all left open in consequence of the disorders of that riotous night, they penetrated into the very heart of the city without opposition, and meeting, according to agreement, at the palace, they surprised the guards and cut them in pieces. Those who were in the palace opening the gates to know the cause of this confusion, the Persians rushed in, took the palace, and killed the king, who came out to meet them sword in hand. Thus an end was put to the Babylonian empire; and Cyrus took possession of Babylon for one called in Scripture Darius the Mede, most probably Cyaxares II., uncle to Cyrus. From this time Babylonia never was erected into a distinct kingdom, but has always followed the fortune of those great conquerors who at different times have appeared in Asia. It is now subject to the Turks.\n",
      "Of the manners, customs, and institutions of the Babylonians, and of the nature of their country, a very clear account has been given by Μ. Sabbathier.\n",
      "“As all the nations under the dominion of Cyrus, beside the ordinary tributes, were obliged to maintain him and his army, the monarch and his troops were supported by all Asia. The country of Babylon alone was obliged to maintain him four months of the year; its fertility, therefore, yielded a third of the produce of Asia. The government of this country, which the Persians termed satrapy, was richer and more extensive than any of the rest. It maintained for the king, besides the war-horses, a stud of 800 stallions and 16,000 mares. So great a number of Indian dogs were likewise bred in this province for the king, that four of its cities kept those animals; and in return, they were exempted from all taxes and tributes.\n",
      "“It rained very seldom in this country, according to Herodotus. The earth was watered by the river, which was here diffused by human industry, as the Nile is over Egypt by nature; for all the country of Babylon was divided by canals, the greatest of which was navigable, and flowed from south to north, from the Euphrates to the Tigris. In short, it was one of the finest countries for corn in the world; but for producing trees, the fig-tree, the vine, and the olive, it was not famous. It was so luxuriant in grain, that it commonly yielded a hundred times more than what was sown; and in good years it yielded three hundred times more than it received. The leaves of its wheat and barley were four inches broad. ‘ Though I know,’ says Herodotus, ‘ that the millet and the sesame of that country grow to the size of trees, I will not describe them particularly, lest those who have not been in Babylonia should think my account fabulous.\n",
      "“They had no oil but what they made from Indian corn. The country abounded with palm-trees, which grew spontaneously; and most of them bore fruit, of which the inhabitants made bread, wine, and honey. They cultivated these trees and their fig-trees in the same manner. Some of them, as of other trees, the Greeks called wιo⅛ ones. They tied the fruit of the male to the trees which bore dates; that the musquitto, leaving the male, might cause the date to ripen, by penetrating it; for without that assistance it did not come to maturity. Mus-quittoes bred in the male palms as in the wild fig-trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we must not here omit to give an account of the peculiar and surprising construction of their boats of skins, in which they sailed along the river to Babylon. These boats were invented by the Armenians, whose country lay north from Babylonia. They made them with poles of willow, which they bent, and covered with skins; the bare side of the skins they put outwards; and they made them so tight that they resembled boards. The boats had neither prow nor stern, but were of a round form like a buckler. They put straw on the bottom. Two men, each with an oar, rowed them down the river, laden with different wares, but chiefly with palm wine. Of these boats some were very large and some very small: the largest carried the weight of 500 talents. There was room for an ass in one of their small boats; they put many into a large one. When they had unloaded, after their arrival at Babylon, they sold the poles of their boats and the straw, and loading their asses with the skins, returned to Armenia; for they could not sail up the river, its current was so rapid. For this reason they made their boats of skins instead of wood; and on their return to Armenia with their asses, they applied the skins to their former use.\n",
      "“As to their dress, they wore a linen shirt, which came down to their feet. Over it they wore a woollen robe; their outer garment was a white vest. Their shoes resembled those of the Thebans. They let their hair grow. On their heads they wore a turban. They rubbed their bodies all over with fragrant liquors. Each man had a ring on his finger, and an elegant cane in his hand, with an apple at the top, or a rose, a lily, or an eagle, or some other figure; for they were not suffered to use canes without devices.\n",
      "“With regard to their policy, Herodotus thinks that their best law was one which the Heneti, an Illyrian people, likewise observed in every town and village. When the girls were marriageable, they were ordered to meet in a certain place, where the young men likewise assembled. They were then sold by the public crier: but he first sold the most beautiful one. When he had sold her at an immense price, he put up others to sale, according to their degrees of beauty. The rich Babylonians were emulous to carry off the finest women, who were sold to die highest bidders. But as the young men who were poor could not aspire to have fine women, they were content to take the ugliest with the money which was given them; for when the crier had sold the handsomest, he ordered the ugliest of all the women to be brought, and asked if any one was willing to take her with a small sum of money. Thus she became the wife of him who was most easily satisfied; and thus the finest women were sold, and from the money which they brought, small fortunes were given to the ugliest, and to those who had any bodily infirmity. A father could not marry his daughter as he pleased; nor was he who brought her allowed i take her home, without giving security that he would marry her. But, after the sale, if the parties were not agreeable to each other, the law enjoined that the purchase-money should be restored. The inhabitants of any of their towns were permitted to marry wives at these aucuns. Such were the early customs of the Babylonians.\n",

      "a very ingenious and learned antiquary, descended from a family ancient, well esteemed, and distinguished by its loyalty and affection for the crown, was born at Crook in 1656. He was educated at the free school at Durham, and thence removed to St John’s College, Cambridge, in 1674. He proceeded A. B. in 1677, A. Μ. in 1681, was elected fellow in March 1680, ordained deacon by Bishop Compton of London in December 1685, and priest by Bishop Barlow of Lincoln the following year. Dr Watson, tutor of the college, who had been nominated, but not yet consecrated, bishop of St David s, offered to take him for his chaplain; but this he declined, probably in the prospect of a like offer from Lord Crew, bishop of Durham, which he soon after accepted. His lordship collated him to the rectory of Long-Ncwton in his diocese, in June 1687; and, as Dr Grey was informed by some of the bishop’s family, the prelate further intended to give him that of Sedgefield, worth L.600 or L.7θθ a year, with a golden prebend, had he not incurred bis lordship’s displeasure and left his family for refusing to read King James II.’s declaration for liberty of conscience. The bishop, who disgraced him for this refusal, and was excepted out of King William’s pardon, took the oaths to that king, and kept his bishopric till his death. Mr Baker resigned Long-Newton on the 1st of August 1690, refusing to take the oaths; and retired to his fellowship at St John s, in which he was protected till the 20th of January 1716-1/, when, with one and twenty others, he was dispossessed of it· After the passing of the Registering Actin 1723, he was desired to register his annuity of L.40, which the last act required before it was amended and explained. Though this annuity, left him by his father for his fortune, with L.20 per annum out of his collieries by his elder brother, from the day of his death in August 1699, and during the remaining part of the lease, which expired at Whitsuntide 1722, was now his whole subsistence, he could not be prevailed on to secure himself against the act. He retained a lively resentment of his deprivations; and wrote himself in all his books, as well as in those which he gave to the college library, socius ejectus, and in some rector ejectus. He continued to reside in the college as commoner-master till his death, which happened on the 2d of July 1740, in consequence of a paralytic stroke. In the afternoon of the 29th June, being alone in his chamber, he was struck with a slight apoplectic fit; but this abating a little, he recovered his senses, and knew all those about him, who were his nephew Burton, and Drs Bedford and Heberden. He seemed perfectly satisfied and resigned; and when Dr Bedford desired him to take some medicine then ordered, he declined it, saying he would only take his usual sustenance, which his bed-maker knew the times and quantities of giving. He was thankful for the affection and care his friends showed him; but, hoping the time of his dissolution was at hand, he would by no means endeavour to retard it. His disorder increased, and the third day after he was seized with the disorder he died. Having been appointed one of the executors of his elder brother’s will, by which a large sum was bequeathed to pious uses, he prevailed on the other two executors, who were his younger brother Francis and the Hon. Charles Montagu, to lay out L.1310 of the money upon an estate to be settled upon St John’s College for six exhibitioners. He likewise gave to the college L.100 for the consideration of L.6 a year, then only legal interest, during his life; and to the library several choice books, both printed and in manuscript, with medals and coins; besides what he left to it by his will, which were “all such books, printed and manuscript, as he had, and were wanting there.” All that Mr Baker printed was, lsŕ, Reflections on Learning, showing the insufficiency thereof in its several particulars, in order to evince the usefulness and necessity of Revelation, Lond. 1709-10, which went through many editions; and, 2√, The preface to Bishop Fisher’s Funeral Sermon for Margaret countess of Richmond and Derby, 1708; both without his name. The latter piece is a sufficient specimen of the editor’s skill in antiquities to make us regret that he did not live to publish his History of St John’s College, from the foundation of old St John’s House to the present time; with some occasional and incidental accounts of the affairs of the university, and of such private colleges as held communication or intercourse with the old house or college; collected principally from manuscripts, and carried on through a succession of masters to the end of Bishop Gunning’s mastership, 1670. His manuscript collections relative to the history and antiquities of the university of Cambridge, amounting to forty-nine volumes in folio and three in quarto, are divided between the British Museum and the public library at Camnudge the former possesses twenty-three volumes, the atter sixteen in folio and three in quarto. Dr Knight styles him “the greatest master of the antiquities of this °uι university;” and Hearne says, “Optandum est ut sua quoque collectanea de antiquitatibus Cantabrigiensibus juris faciat publici Cl. Bakerus, quippe qui cruditione summa judicioque acri et subacto polleat.” Mr Baker intend- c ,. something like an Athenoe Cantabrigienses, on the plan 0 the Athene Oxomenses. aker, Henry, an ingenious and diligent naturalist, was 0rn in Fleet-street, London, either near the end of the seventeen th, or very early in the beginning of the eighteenth century. His father’s profession is not known, but his mother was in hcr time a midwife of great practice. He was brought up under an eminent bookseller, who preceded the elder Dodsley, to the business of a bookseller; in which, however, he appears not to have engaged at all after his apprenticeship, or, if he did, it was soon relinquished by him; for although it was in his power to have drawn away all his master’s best customers, he would not set up against him. Mr Baker being of a philosophical turn of mind, and having diligentlyattended to the methods which might be practicable and useful in the cure of stammering, especially in teaching deaf and dumb persons to speak, made this the employment of his life. In the prosecution of so valuable and difficult an undertaking he was very successful, and several of his pupils have borne testimony to the ability and good effect of his instructions. He married Sophia, youngest daughter of the famous Daniel Defoe, who brought him two sons, both of whom he survived. On the 29th of January 1740 Mr Baker was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and on the 12th of March following, the same honour was conferred upon him by the Royal Society. In 1744 Sir Godfrey Copley’s gold medal was bestowed upon him, for having, by his microscopical experiments on the crystallizations and configuration of saline particles, produced the most extraordinary discovery during that year. Having led a very useful and honourable life, he died at his apartments in the Strand on the 25th of November 1774, being then above seventy years of age. His wife had been dead some time before; and he only left one grandson, William Baker, who was born the 17th of February 1763, and to whom, onhisliving to the age of twenty-one, he bequeathed the bulk of his fortune, which he had acquired by his profession of teaching deaf and dumb persons to speak. His furniture, printed books (but not manuscripts), curiosities, and collections of every sort, he directed to be sold, which was accordingly done. His fine collection of native and foreign fossils, petrifactions, shells, corals, vegetables, ores, &c. with some antiquities, and other curiosities, were sold by auction the 13th of March 1775 and the nine following days. He was buried, as he desired, in an unexpensive manner, in the church-yard of St Mary-le-strand; within which church, on the south wall, he ordered a small tablet to be erected to his memory. An inscription for it, he said, would probably be found among his papers; if not, he hoped some learned friend would write one agreeable to truth. This friendly office, however, remains as yet to be performed. Mr Baker was a constant and useful attendant at the meetings of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and in both was frequently chosen one of the council. He was peculiarly attentive to all new improvements in natural science, and very solicitous for the prosecution of them. Several of his communications are printed in the Philosophical Transactions; and besides the papers written by himself, he was the means, by his extensive correspondence, of conveying to the society the intelligence and observations of other inquisitive and philosophical men, both at home and abroad. The Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, is under singular obligations to this worthy naturalist. As he was one of the earliest members of the society, so he contributed in no small degree to its rise and establishment. At its first institution he officiated for some time gratis as secretary. He was many years chairman of the committee of accounts, and he took an active part in the general deliberations of the society. He drew up a short account of the original of this society, and of the concern he himself had in forming it; which was read before the society of antiquaries, and would be a pleasing present to the public. Mr Baker was a poetical writer in the early part of his life. His Invocation of Health got abroad without his knowledge; but was reprinted by himself in his Original Poems, serious and humorous, 8vo, 1725 and 1726. Among these poems are some tales as witty and as loose as Prior’s. He was the author likewise of The Universe, a poem intended to restrain the pride of man; which has been several times reprinted.

      "a city of Asia, in Syria, anciently called Heliopolis, and by the Arabians, “The Wonder of Syria.” It is situated at the foot of Anti-Libanus, on the last rising ground where the mountain terminates in the plain.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the south, the city is first discovered at the distance of about a league and a half, behind a hedge of trees, over the verdant tops of which appears a white edging of domes and minarets. After about an hour’s journey the traveller reaches these trees, which are very fine walnuts; and soon after, crossing some ill-cultivated gardens by winding paths, arrives at the entrance of the city. Here he perceives a ruined wall, flanked with square towers, which ascends the declivity to the right, and traces out the precincts of the ancient city. This wall, which is only ten or twelve feet in height, admits a view of those void spaces and heaps of ruins which are invariable characteristics of every Turkish city; but what principally attracts attention is a large edifice on the left, which, by its lofty walls and rich columns, is soon recognised as one of those temples which antiquity has left for our admiration. These ruins, which are among the most beautiful and best preserved of any in Asia, merit a particular description. .\n",
      "To form a just idea of them, the reader must imagine himself descending from the interior of the town. After Grossing the rubbish and huts with which it is filled, the first thing deserving of notice is a vacant space, which appears to have been a square: there, in front, towards the west, is a grand ruin, consisting of two pavilions ornamented with pilasters, joined at their lower angle by a wall 160 feet in length. This front commands the open country from a sort of terrace, on the edge of which are with difficulty distinguished the bases of twelve columns, which formerly extended from the one pavilion to the other, and formed a portico. The principal gate is obstructed by heaps of stones; but, that obstacle surmounted, the traveller enters an empty space, which is a hexagonal court of 180 feet in diameter. This court is strewed with broken columns, mutilated capitals, and the remains of pilasters, entablatures, and cornices; and around it is a row of ruined edifices, which display all the ornaments of the richest architecture. At the end of this court, opposite the west, is an outlet, which formerly was a gate, through which is perceived a still more extensive range of ruins, the magnificence of which strongly excites curiosity. To have a full prospect of these, it is necessary to ascend a slope, at the top of which is the entrance of a square court, much more spacious than the former, being 350 feet in width and 336 in length. The eye is first attracted to the end of this court, where are six enormous and majestic columns nearly entire. Another object not less interesting is a second range of columns to the left, which appear to have formed part of the peristyle of a temple. But the edifices which inclose this court on either side claim attention in the first instance. These form a sort of gallery containing various chambers, seven of which may be reckoned in each of the principal wings, namely, two in a semicircle, and five in an oblong square. The base of the apartments still retains pediments of niches and tabernacles, the supporters of which have been destroyed. On the side of the court they are open, while four columns on the one side and six on the other have been totally destroyed. It is not easy to conceive the use of these apartments; but this does not lessen the admiration excited by the beauty of their pilasters and the richness of the frieze of the entablature. Neither is it possible to avoid remarking the singular effect which results from the mixture of the garlands, the large foliage of the capitals, and the sculpture of wild plants, with which they are everywhere ornamented. In the middle of the court is a little square esplanade, where anciently stood a pavilion, of which nothing how remains but the foundation. With regard to the six columns above mentioned, it is impossible to survey them without being struck with the boldness of their elevation and. the richness of their workmanship. Their shafts are twenty-one feet eight inches in circumference, and fifty, eight in height; so that the total height, including the entablature, is from seventy-one to seventy-two feet. The sight of this superb ruin, thus solitary and desolate, is exceedingly imposing; but a more attentive examination discovers a series of foundations, marking an oblong square of 268 feet in length and 146 in width, which probably formed the peristyle of a grand temple, the primary purpose of this whole structure. It presented to the great court, that is, to the east, a front of ten columns, with nineteen on each side; which, with the six already mentioned, make in all fifty-four. The ground on which it stood is an oblong square, on a level with the court, but considerably narrower, so that there was only a terrace of twenty-seven feet wide round the colonnade; while the esplanade thus produced fronts the open country towards the west, by a sloping wall of about thirty feet. In approaching the city this descent becomes less steep, so that the foundation of the pavilion is on a level with the termination of the hill; whence it is evident that the whole ground of the courts has been artificially raised. Such seems to have been the former state of this edifice; but the southern side of the grand temple was afterw ards blocked up in order to build a smaller one, the peristyle and walls of which are still remaining. This temple, situated somewhat lower than the other, presents a side of thirteen columns by eight in front, or thirty-four in all, which are likewise of the Corinthian order, their shafts being fifteen feet eight inches in circumference, and forty-four feet in height. The building they surround is an oblong square, the front of which, turned towards the east, is out of the line of the left wing of the great court. To reach it the traveller must cross trunks of columns, heaps of stone, and a ruinous wall, by which it is now hid. After surmounting these obstacles he arrives at the gate, where he may survey the inclosure which was once the habitation of a god; but, instead of the awful scene of a prostrate people, and sacrifices offered by a multitude of priests, the sky is seen through the open roof, which lets in light enough to show a chaos of ruins covered with dust and weeds. The walls, formerly enriched with all the ornaments of the Corinthian order, now present nothing but pediments of niches and tabernacles, of which almost all the supporters have fallen to the ground. Between these niches is a range of fluted pilasters, the capitals of which support a broken entablature; but what remains displays a rich frieze of foliage resting on the heads of satyrs, horses, bulls, and other animals. Oyer this entablature was the ancient roof, which was 57 feet in width and 110 in length. The walls which supported it are thirty-one feet high, and without a window. It is impossible to form any idea of the ornaments of this roof, except from the fragments lying on the ground; but it could scarcely have been richer in ornament than the gallery of the peristyle. The principal remaining parts contain tablets in the form of lozenges, on which are represented Jupiter seated on his eagle, Leda caressed by the swan, Diana with her bow and crescent, and several busts of emperors and empresses. It is unnecessary to enter more minutely into the description of this astonishing edifice. The lovers of the arts will find it described with the greatest truth and accuracy in a work published at London in 1757, under the title of Ruins of Palbec. This work, compiled by Mr Robert Wood, the world owes to the attention and liberality of Mr Dawkins, who, in 1751, visited Balbec and Palmyra. Several changes, however, have taken place since their journey, and some of the columns then standing have been overturned or destroyed.\n",
      "When we consider the extraordinary magnificence of the temple of Balbec, we cannot but be astonished at the silence of the Greek and Roman authors respecting it. Mr Wood, who carefully examined all the ancient writers, has found no mention of it except in a fragment of John ’of Antioch, who attributes the construction of this edifice to Antoninus Pius. The inscriptions that remain corroborate this opinion; which, moreover, accounts for the constant use of the Corinthian order, since that order was not in general use before the third age of Rome. But we ought by no means to allege as an additional proof the bird sculptured over the gate; for if his crooked beak, large claws, and the caduceus he bears, give him the appearance of an eagle, the tuft of feathers on his head, like that of certain pigeons, proves that he is not the Roman ea σ le. Besides, the same bird is found in the temple of Palmyra, and is therefore probably an oriental eagle, consecrated to the Sun, who was the divinity adored in both these temples. Heliolatry existed at Balbec in the most remote antiquity. The statue of the Sun, which resembled that of Osiris, had been transported thither from the Heliopolis of Egypt; and the ceremonies with which he was worshipped there have been described by Macrobius in his curious collection, entitled Saturnalia. Mr Wood supposes, with reason, that the name of Balbec, which in Syriac signifies “City of Bal,” or of the Sun, originated in this worship. The Greeks, in naming it Heliopolis, have, therefore, only given a literal translation of the oriental word; a practice to which they have not always adhered. We are ignorant of the state of this city in remote antiquity; but it is to be presumed that its situation on the road from Tyre to Palmyra secured it some part of the commerce of these opulent capitals. Under the Homans, in the time of Augustus, it is mentioned as a garrisoned town; and there i\n",

      "is a word frequently used as synonymous with song: but it properly denotes an historical song, or a song containing a narrative of adventures or exploits, either serious or comic. It is one of the most ancient species of composition, and still constitutes a great portion of the literature of the more uncivilized tribes of mankind. Giovanni Finati, who supplies us with much information respecting the manners and customs of the East, has recorded the following anecdote of ballad-literature among the Benysackr Arabs, whom he found encamped near the shores of the Dead Sea. Their chief, Ibn Fays, he states, “had strangers with him from Damascus, and feasted his guests so plentifully, that the wooden dish out of which we all fed had four iron handles to it, and required three persons to lift it and set it before us. Afterwards, a great earthen pan of grease was lighted as a lamp for the company, and Ibn Fays himself, and his brother, sung a sort of slow plaintive ballad to an instrument with one string, the purport of which was the tragic account of a battle against a neighbouring tribe, in which their own father perished·”^[1. Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Giovanni Finati, translated by William John Bankes, Esq. vol. ii. p. 272. Lond. 1830, 2 vols. 8vo. ] The leader of this wandering horde might himself be the author, as well as tlιe reciter, of the ballad which thus regaled his guests.\n",
      "Most of the nations of modern Europe have considerable collections of the ballads which delighted their forefathers; and in some countries the political influence of such compositions has been found to be very powerful. “Of these,” says Dr Aikin, ζζ the most copious source is party; and there has seldom been an occasion of political contest in countries permitting such freedoms, in which appeal has not been made to the popular feelings by means of comic and satirical ballads, often with great effect. The share that Lilliburlero had in producing the Revolution in this country has been noticed by grave historians. In the war of the Fronde in France, ballads were a weapon as much employed as muskets, and those written for and against Cardinal Mazarin filled several volumes. The French give to these compositions the appropriate title of Vaudeville, implying their fitness to walk the streets; and indeed street-poetry iñ general belongs to the ballad class.”^[2. Aikin’s Essay on Song-Writing (p. xviii.) prefixed to Vocal Poetry, or a Select Collection of English Songs. Bond. 1810, 8vo. ] The Spaniards^[3. See the introduction to Depping’s Sammlung der besten alten Spanischen Historischen llittcr-und Maurischen Romanzen. Altenburg und Leipzig, 1817, 12mo. ] and other nations of the south have preserved ample collections of their early ballads; but the affinity of our own nation and tongue with those of the northern tribes, renders their literary reliques an object of more particular interest. The various tribes of Scandinavians have generally been distinguished for their love of poetry. Many ancient reliques of Islandic poetry are still preserved, and are regarded as very curious specimens of the literature of the different ages to which they belong; nor are the kindred nations of Sweden and Denmark without their early and recent poets, some of whom have attained to high reputation. Of the ballad-poetry of these northern nations, many remnants have descended to our times; and ample collections of Danish, Swedish, and even Feroese ballads have recently been published by respectable editors, “The songs mentioned by Tacitus in his account of the Germans,” says Mr Jamieson, “those collected by the order of Charlemagne, and those which the Goths brought with them out of the East, are now not to be found; yet it is more than probable that much more of them is preserved, in however altered a form, than we are aware of; in the elder northern and Teutonic romances, the Danish and Swedish, Scottish and English popular ballads, and those which are sung by old women and nurses, and hawked about at fairs, in Germany.”^[4. Illustrations of Northern Antiquities, p. 245. Edinb. 1814, 4to. ] The same ingenious and well-informed writer has elsewhere expressed his conviction, that many of the traditionary ballads still current in this kingdom have been preserved in the north of England and the lowlands of Scotland, ever since the arrival of the Cimbri in Britain.^[5. Jamieson’s Popular Ballads and Songs, vol. ii. p. 87∙ Edinb. 180G, 2 vols. 8vo.—See however Mr Finlay’s Scottish Historical and Romantic Ballads, vol. i. p. xxv. Edinb. 1808, 2 vols. 8vo. ] Many of our historical ballads may at all events be considered as the productions of a remote period; but it is not to be supposed that they have been transmitted from one generation to another without innumerable transformations. A great proportion of them have doubtless been preserved by oral tradition; and they seem in general to have undergone such changes as brought them nearer to the current speech of each successive generation; for, without this progressive adaptation, the lapse of a few centuries would have rendered them unintelligible to the great body of the people; nor is it usual for any combination of words to be retained in the memory without being understood. Thus, for example, we have reason to believe that the ballad of Sir Patrick Spence derives its origin from a very early age; but the variations to which it must gradually have been subjected, may easily be inferred from a comparison of the different copies which are now to be found.^[6. Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, vol. i. p. 81. Scott’s Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, vol. i. p. 7∙ Jamieson’s Popular Ballads. and Songs, vol. i. p. 157—See Mr Motherwell’s Minstrelsy, Ancient and Modern, p. xliv. Glasgow, 1827, 4to. ] A story may thus be preserved, when most of the original words have been changed. The close affinity between the old Danish and the old Scotish and English ballads has been noticed by various writers, by Pinkerton, Jamieson, Nyerup, Geijer, and Grimm:^[7. Pinkerton’s Enquiry, vol. i. p. 3G4. Jamieson’s Ballads, vol. ii. p- 87∙ Nyerup, Danske Viser, Bind v. S. 12. Geįjer, Svcnska Folk-Visor, del. i. s. liv—The affinity between the old English and the old Danish ballads is noticed in the preface (S. xxxi.) to Altdii-nische Heldenlieder, Balladen, und Märchen, übersetzt von Wilhelm Carl Grimm. Heidelberg, 1811, - 8vo. ] their resemblance is to be traced in the general spirit and contrivance of the poems; while some of the Danish and Scotish ballads exhibit a remarkable coincidence in their particular stories. Whether these effects are to be imputed to so remote a cause as the emigration of the ancient Scandinavians, may however admit of much doubt and hesitation. Fiction moves from one region to another with very elastic steps, and in many instances it is impossible to trace her progress.\n",
      "The earliest collector of Danish ballads was Anders Sörensön Vedel, chaplain to the king of Denmark, and an intimate friend of the celebrated astronomer Tyge Brahe. His publication bears the title of an hundred select Danish ballads, or Et hundrede vduaalde Danske Viser. Ribe, 1591, 8vo. It is now a very rare book, even in Denmark; but a copious account of it is given by Nyerup, in the last volume of the more recent collection of Danske Viser. After an interval of more than a century, another clergyman, Peder Syv, reprinted this collection of Vedel, and added an equal number of ballads. Kiöbenhavn, 1695, 8vo. But the most extensive collection appeared under the following title: Udvalgte Danske Viser fra AIiddelalderen; efter A. S. Vedels og P. Syvs trykte Uđgaver, og efter haand-skrevne Samlinger, udgivne paa ny af Abrahamson, Nyerup, og Rahbek. Kiöbenhavn, 1812-14, 5 Bind. 8vo. This work is accompanied with notes and illustrations, and appears to us to possess no inconsiderable value. A similar collection of Swedish ballads was published by Geijer and Afzelius: Svenska Folk-Visor frŭm Forηtideη i sam- 1ade och utgifne af Er. Gust. Geijer och Arv. Aug. Afzelius. Stockholm, 1814-16, 3 del. 8vo. These volumes are accompanied with music, printed in a quarto form. Of Feroese ballads there is a recent collection: Foerö-iske Qpoeder om Sigurd Fosnersbane og hans AEt, med et Anhang: samlede og oversatte af Hans Christian Lyng-bye, Sognepraest i Gjesing; med en Indledning af P. Ľ. Müller, Dr. og Prof, i Theol. Randers, 1822, 8vo. Dr Müller, the.author of the introduction, is a learned and able writer, well known as the author of more important works.\n",
      "Debes mentions that, at their weddings, and at Christmas, the Feroese w ere accustomed to “recreate themselves with a plain dance, holding one another by the hand, and singing some old champion’s ballad.”^[8. Debes’s Description of the Islands and Inhabitants of Foeroc, Englished by Dr Sterpin, p. 273. Lonđ. 1676, 12mo. ] These islands were peopled in the ninth century by a colony of Norwegians.^[9. Torfaei Commentatio historica de Rébus gestis Foereyensium seu Faròensium, p. 7- Havniae, 1695, 8vo. ] The language of the people, as it appears in these ballads, is removed to a considerable distance from the Islandic as well as the Danish. The plan of publishing a Feroese dictionary was formed about half a century ago; and the English prospectus printed upon that occasion furnishes so curious and entertaining a specimen of the language, that we are tempted to insert it with all its peculiarities.\n",

      "B aLL t ZE, Etienne, a writer eminently distinguished by his knowledge of history, ecclesiastical antiquities, and the canon law, was born at Tulle on the 24th of December 1630, being the descendant of a family which had long adhered to the legal profession. He received his elementary education at the place of his nativity, and afterwards prosecuted his studies in the university' of Toulouse, where he obtained an exhibition in the College of St Martial. Having finished his course of philosophy, he commenced his attendance in the schools of law; but although he attained to great proficiency in certain departments of jurisprudence, lie felt no inclination for the ordinary occupations of a lawyer, and never followed the profession of an advocate. He possessed a natural alacrity of mind, and was capable of the most intense literary exertion; and his life being prolonged beyond the ordinary limits, he successively' engaged in many undertakings of great research and of great utility. Before he quitted the university, he appeared in the character of an author. His earliest inquiries related to different subjects of ecclesiastical antiquities; and the reputation which he thus acquired recommended him to the notice of Μ. de Montchal, archbishop of Toulouse, who granted him access to his library. This prelate was succeeded by Μ. de Marca, who soon became archbishop of Paris, and who was profoundly skilled in those branches of knowledge which Baluze so long continued to cultivate. In 1656 the archbishop invited him to the metropolis. Here he improved in the good graces of his patron, and even participated in his learned researches. From an individual of so much influence at court, he might naturally have hoped for a competent share of preferment; but before his hopes were realized, the prelate died on the 29th of June 1662.\n",
      "He speedily found another favourer of his studies in Μ. le Tellier, afterwards chancellor of France, who, with the view of engaging him in the service of his son the Abbé le Tellier, the future archbishop of Reims, conferred upon him many benefits, of which he retained a grateful remembrance. But, from various causes, the proposed arrangement never took place; and he was next connected with the establishment of Μ. de Lamothe-Houdancourt, archbishop of Auch. In 1667 Μ. Colbert offered him the situation of keeper of his library, one of the most magnificent private collections in Europe; and its value, both in manuscripts and in printed books, was greatly augmented by the judgment and zeal of the learned librarian. Having retained, his office for some time after the death of Colbert, he resigned it in the year 1700: the library had then descended to the archbishop of Rouen, and he had ceased to find his situation agreeable. He appears to have occupied apartments connected with the library; and we are informed that he now retired to a house belonging to the Scotish College.\n",
      "In the year 1668, the Abbé Faget published some works of his relation Μ. de Marca; and, in the life prefixed, he took occasion to state, that when the prelate was at the point of death, he enjoined Baluze to place all his pap rs in the hands of his son the president. He had in reality committed his manuscripts to the care of Baluze himself, who was therefore greatly offended at this statement, and vented his spleen in different letters. The abbé replied in the same strain, and afterwards inserted their angry correspondence in his collection of Dissertations. Thí heat which Baluze displayed upon this occasion excited the more surprise, as his disposition was habitually gentle. Of his animosity against Faget he has left a further rŗ cord in his life of De Marca, prefixed to the treatise a⅛ Concordia Sacerdotii et Imperii,\n",
      "In 1670 he was appointed professor of the canon law in the Royal College. The canon law had long been taught in the university of Paris, and there indeed it was long tau< τ ht tθ the enti re exclusion of the civil law; but this was°a new chair which the king was pleased to erect in his favour; and of his high qualifications for such a professorship he has left the most unequivocal proofs. Nor was this die only preferment which his learning procured him. He was appointed a canon of the cathedral of Reims; and in the privilege appended to his edition of Marius Mercator, printed in the year 1684, he is designated “Estienne Baluze, prieur de Beauvais.” It may therefore be inferred that he enjoyed a considerable pension from that abbey; nor were such arrangements uncommon at that period of the history of France. He is described as “simple tonsure ;” an expression which denotes that he was not a priest or a deacon, but had only been initiated into one of the lowest of the seven holy orders. In order to recompense Μ. Martin, who had been the tutor of Colbert’s children, that minister had procured him a pension of 2000 livres, payable out of the bishopric of Auxerre; but the conscientious ecclesiastic represented to his patron that he had rendered no services to the diocese of Auxerre, and therefore could accept of no share of its revenues, more especially as a compensation for services which were not of a spiritual, but of a temporal nature. One half of this pension was then bestowed upon Baluze, whose scruples do not appear to have been equally powerful. In 1683 he had published a volume of councils, and it was his original intention to extend the collection to several volumes; but some of the materials which he had prepared could not be much relished at Rome; and as his pension required the sanction of that most corrupt of all courts, he thought it expedient to abandon his design. Of the acts of the council of Basel he had proposed to print a very ample collection; and this was indeed the part of his plan for which the whole had chiefly been undertaken. After an interval of ten years, he published his lives of the popes of Avignon; a work of curious research, which procured him a pension from the crown, and afterwards the office of director of the Royal College, where he succeeded the Abbé Gallois in the year 1700. But the favour of a court is at all times and in all places held by a very precarious tenure. Baluze, who had attached himself to Cardinal de Bouillon, and had been employed in writing the history of his family, was involved in the disgrace which attended this illustrious prelate. He had traced the cardinal’s lineage to the ancient dukes of Guienne and counts of Auvergne; and when his patron had retired to a foreign country, the tyranny of Louis XIV. endeavoured to mortify him in the person of his family-historian, who was charged with abetting the cardinal’s pretensions to independence. A lettre de cachet removed him from Paris: his place of exile was repeatedly changed, and his residence successively restricted to Rouen, Blois, Tours, and Orleans; nor could he obtain his recall till the year 1713, after the peace of Utrecht: but although he was at length permitted to revisit Paris, he never recovered his two offices of director and professor of the Royal College. Such proceedings as these, which were very far from being uncommon, are sufficiently characteristic of the old despotism of France.\n",
      "Although this persecution commenced when he had nearly attained the age of eighty, it did not quench his literary ardour; for,during his exile, he employed himselfin preparing an edition of the works of St Cyprian, which was published after his death. His constitution had never been vigorous, but the sobriety and regularity of his habits enabled him to reach a mature and healthy old age; and, accordas to the expression of Niceron, he lived with pleasure and died with resignation.^[1. Niceron, Mémoires pour servir à ľHistoire des Hommes illustres dans la République des Lettres, toni. i. p. 159. ] He died on the 28th of July 1718, in the eighty-eighth year of his age; and his remains were interred in the church of St Sulpice. A person who had lived so long in the midst of learned dust, without either wife or children to blow it aside, could not well be without his share of peculiarities. He was not entirely exempted from caprice, and his testament exhibited this caprice in no very amiable light; his relations and domestics were almost totally forgotten, and the bulk of his pro∣- perty was bequeathed to a woman who appears to have had no claim upon him. Some scholars, who have collected libraries with much labour and at great expense, are inclined to cherish an anxious wish that they should be preserved entire; but, on the contrary, he was desirous that his library should be sold in detail, lest any one individual should be put in possession of those literary treasures which he himself had gradually amassed. This collection consisted of 10,799 articles, including more than 1500 manuscripts, together with 115 printed books which he had interspersed with annotations. The manuscripts were added to the Royal Library.\n",
      "Baluze was a man of great learning and research in those departments to which he had devoted his chief attention; and his publications have in an eminent degree elucidated various branches of law, history, and antiquities. His merits are perhaps more conspicuous as an editor than as an author. He was particularly conversant with ancient manuscripts; and being likewise possessed of much erudition and critical skill, he has published valuable editions of many ancient monuments. If his labours had not extended beyond the Capitularia Regum Francorum, his name would always have been mentioned with respect by lawyers and historians; but some of his other publications greatly illustrate the history of the middle ages; nor must we forget the light which they reflect upon the history of the canon law, and upon the writings of the Latin fathers.\n",

      "an extensive and important country of interior Africa, with which the journeys of Park, who was perhaps the first European that reached it, have made us tolerably acquainted. It is situated between the 1st and 5th degrees of east longitude, and the 12th and 15th of north latitude. It has on the west the countries of Manding, Kaarta, and Ludamar; on the north Beeroo; on the east Masina and Jinbala, which separate it from Timbuctoo; on the south Baedoo, Maniana, and the high region of Kong. It consists of a spacious and fertile plain watered by the Niger, having on the south the chain of mountains which here traverses the interior of the continent, and on the north the African desert.\n",
      "In consequence of this situation the climate over the greater part of Bambarra is intensely hot. On the borders of the northern desert it is absolutely scorching. In the sandy tracts, during the middle of the day, the ground is often too hot for the foot to tread upon; and Mr Park, as he lay in his tent, felt sensible pain in applying his hand to the current of air as it entered through the crevices. In the southern districts, which are copiously watered, the air, especially in the mornings and evenings, is much more temperate. In the beginning of June a strong south-west wind begins to blow, accompanied with violent storms and tornadoes, which produce the most pernicious effects on the health, especially of Europeans. This forms the commencement of the rainy season, which continues with violence for three months, during which the country is deluged; all the streams, formerly shallow and almost dried up, now swell and overflow their banks; and the country situated along the Niger and its tributaries is generally inundated. In August the rain ceases, the waters disappear, and the soil is found to be highly improved and fertilized by this alluvion.\n",
      "The rich plain, thus copiously watered, is fitted for producing in abundance all the richest tropical products. Cultivation also is by no means deficient, though not brought to the same perfection as in the improved districts of Europe; yet the vicinity of the great towns reminded Mr -™rk .°f thθ finest tracts of England. The imperfect diffusion of culture is proved by the circumstance, that there is no private property in land, nor is any price attached to it. It i s judged to belong either to the king or the village; and any individual who wishes an additional quantity may obtain it on application, subject only to a penalty if he fails to bring it under cultivation. The grains chiefly reared are Indian corn, rice, and millet. The plough is unknown; the hoe being, as in other parts of native Africa, the only instrument used in turning up the ground. The pine-apple, orange, banana, and other fine fruits peculiar.to tropical countries, though partially introduced on the coast, have not found their way into this interior kingdom. Several peculiar and valuable trees and shrubs, however, are produced on its plains. Among these is the shea-toulou, or tree producing vegetable butter. It very much resembles the American oak; and the valuable substance consists in the kernel of a nut, somewhat resembling a Spanish olive. The butter, in Mr Park’s opinion, is firmer, whiter, and of richer flavour than that made from cow’s milk, and has the advantage of being easily preserved during the whole year without salt. In the neighbourhood of Sego it grows in peculiar abundance, and forms a subject of export to the surrounding countries. The lotus, a celebrated and classical shrub, whose berries, on being pounded and dried, are formed into cakes resembling the best gingerbread, grows along the northern border of Bambarra; to which may be added the kolla or gooroo nut, the agreeable bitter taste of which is universally relished by the negroes. Cotton and indigo, as the materials, the one for weaving, the other for dyeing their cloths, are cultivated with diligence and success. Tobacco is cultivated; but neither the sugarcane, the coffee, nor the cocoa-tree, appears to be even known in this part of Africa.\n",
      "The staple manufacture in Bambarra, and, indeed, generally in central Africa, is that of cotton stuffs dyed with their fine indigo. The process is exceedingly simple; the juice of the indigo leaves is extracted by pounding, mixed in a lye of wood ashes, and the cloth is then steeped in the vat. By this process a beautiful and durable colour is produced. The natives have also the art of tanning the leather of sheep and goats, and staining it with red and yellow colours. They possess, besides, the art of smelting iron, and forming it into spears, hoes, and other warlike and useful instruments; but they have in vain attempted the fabrication of fire-arms. They fashion the gold which abounds in the neighbouring districts into bracelets, necklaces, and other ornaments, with a variety of taste and an elegance of fancy which would excite admiration in the best European workmen.\n",
      "The commerce of Bambarra is carried on partly along the Niger, partly by inland caravans proceeding in different directions. The Niger becomes navigable at Bammakoo, the very point where it enters Bambarra, and continues to be so during its whole course through that kingdom. The trade is considerable, and numerous boats are seen passing and repassing. These boats are of a singular construction, consisting of the trunks of two large trees hollowed out, and joined together lengthwise, without decks or masts. They are disproportionably long and narrow, though very capacious, since Mr Park saw in one of them four horses and a great many passengers crossing a ferry. The most extensive traffic, however, here, as in all the countries of interior Africa, is carried on by land-caravans. The chief object of import is salt, a necessary of life of which Bambarra, like all the tracts situated on the interior rivers, is entirely destitute; but it is procured from large pits in the interior of the desert. There are imported, also, considerable quantities of European goods, arms, cloths, toys, and ornaments. These are brought partly from the coast, partly from Barbary by way of Timbuctoo, partly by the direct route from Aroan to Sansanding. The exports consist of gold, not produced within the kingdom itself, but in the high districts to the south, and found in the sands of the rivulets which fall into the Niger, whence, by mere agitation in water, it is separated in the form of dust. The other great staple consists in slaves, for which, till lately, the European settlements on the coast afforded so very extensive a market. The slaves from Bambarra, belonging to a more civilized and industrious race than the Inhabitants of the turbulent little states into which Africa is generally divided, are subjected to less restraint, and bear a higher value in the market. This unjust and calamitous traffic, which excited and prolonged African wars, has been greatly diminished since the prohibition by England of her own trade, and since she obtained permission from the other powers to put a stop generally to that carried on north of the line. Doubtless, however, there is still an extensive contraband.\n",
      "Bambarra is the point where the two great races of interior Africa, the Moors and negroes, meet and mix with each other. The great inroad by which the former have occupied so large a proportion oí this continent, is bounded generally, though not uniformly or completely, by the Niger. The nations to the north and east of Bambarra are mostly Moors, to the south and west negroes. Within the country itself the negro is still the ruling power; though in many of the large eastern towns the Moors are the most numerous, and have the almost entire municipal jurisdiction. They are generally superior to the natives in intelligence, and, as in the rest of Africa, are a stirring, trafficking, bigoted, turbulent race. Their fanatical enmity to Christians probably causes them present themselves to our travellers under a more unamiable aspect than they would otherwise exhibit. They are possessed of some knowledge of letters, of which the native tribes are altogether destitute; and by imparting these first elements of knowledge, they extend both their faith and their influence. They make a much less laudable use of the credit thus acquired, by composing saphies or charms, to which the credulous negroes attach the most extraordinary virtues, purchasing at a high price this delusive mode of protection. The negroes, on the other hand, are a race generally harmless, thoughtless, voluptuous, but kind and open-hearted. Their hospitality was in several instances signally displayed towards Mr Park, and “to suffer the king’s stranger to depart hungry, was considered an heinous offence.” They possess a good deal of agricultural industry, practise some fine manufactures, and have even a talent for extemporary poetry; but their intellectual culture on the whole ranks very low. Polygamy is generally established, though only the chiefs and very opulent individuals can or do carry if to a great extent. Domestic slavery is also general, but under a mild form; the master and slave living almost as equals, and sometimes eating at the same table.\n",
      "Sego, or Sego-see-korro, the capital of Bambarra, is a large town, containing about 30,000 inhabitants. It is divided by the Niger into two nearly equal parts; and the opposite parts are each divided into two quarters, which being respectively surrounded by a mud-wall, have the appearance almost of separate towns. Although the houses be only of clay with flat roofs, yet those of the higher ranks have two stories, with their roofs whitewashed, while Moorish mosques, with their minarets, rise in different quarters. The city, on the whole, with its highly-cultivated vicinity, presented a scene such as Mr Park little expected to find in the heart of Africa. The communication between the two towns was by a ferry. The chief seat of Bambarran trade is San san ding, which p\n",

      "This plant is generally ranked by botanists in the number of reeds; but some, less sensible of its analogies with them, incline to institute a separate genus for it. In the Systema Naturae·, Linnaeus describes two species, under the genus Bambusa, which is characterized thus - “scales three, covering the spikelets, which are about five flowered; calyx none; corolla, a two-valved glume; style bifid; seed one.” Loureiro, who had an opportunity of studying the nature of the bamboo in its own climate, characterizes it as having “flowers with six stamina; panicle diffused, with imbricate spikelets; branches of the culm spiny; calyx one flowered.” We shall abstain from discussing the more minute botanical characters, as it is to the real utility of the plant that our attention is to be directed. The bamboo is, then, a native of the warmer climates only, though growing luxuriantly without the limits of the torrid zone. It rises to the height of forty, sixty, or even eighty feet, with a slender hollow stem, shining as if varnished. Many, however (probably according to the particular species), are only twelve or fifteen feet high; and those which attain the greatest height here mentioned are rather to be viewed in the same light as the overgrown vegetable productions of our own country. The stem is extremely slender, not exceeding the thickness of five inches in some which are fifty feet high, and in others reaching fifteen or eighteen inches in diameter. The whole is divided into joints or articulations, separated by a short interval, called a knot or internode; and in some there is the distance of several feet between each. Small alternate branches spring from the base to the top, and, together with the narrow-pointed leaves issuing from the knots, give the tree an elegant feathered appearance as it waves in the wind.\n",
      "The rapidity of growth is surprising in the bamboo. It sometimes vegetates three or four inches in a single day. Accurate observers have seen it rise twenty feet, and expand as thick as a man’s wrist, in five or six weeks; and it has been known to reach thirty feet in six months. This enables us to credit the assertions of those naturalists who maintain that its full dimensions are attained in a year; and that the only subsequent change is greater thickness and induration of the wood. It is always more solid and compact towards the root, and the hollow cells of the stem become wider in proportion as they ascend. In Malabar it is said to bear fruit when fifteen years old, and then to die. Slenderness is a distinguishing characteristic of the whole plant, and it seems probable that there are several different species which have not yet been recognised by systematic botanists. Soil and climate may have also produced effects which would disappear on uniformity of circumstances. An observer of the bamboos of China, in general, considers that there are ten species or varieties, and an observer of those in Cochin-China admits of eight. The former judges the difference to consist, first, in the size and height; for there is here the greatest disparity in those that are full grown. 2dly, The distance of the knots, or length of joint, which, in certain species of full-grown bamboo, is only four inches, while in others young and slender it extends to nine or ten feet. ⅛dly, In the colour of the wood, which is whitish, yellow, brown, pale blue, or speckled, ⅛thly, In the size and form of the knots, some swelling out from the stem above and below; others encircling it like a cord, and not penetrating within so as to interrupt the tubular part of the bamboo. ĩdhly, In the surface and figure of the internodes being channelled or covered with tubercles; and a kind is said to exist called the square bamboo. The varnished surface is also of different quality, §thly, In the substance and thickness of the wood, which, varying without any relation to the dimensions of the plant, afford sufficient characteristics for constituting a species. The wood is either soft and tender, or very hard and of great strength; and the stem is either very thin and hollow, or almost totally filled up and solid, like other trees. But elsewhere, in Bangalore for example, this solidity is not ascribed to the difference of species, but to the tardiness of its growth in stony places, r lthly, It is said that there are bamboos entirely devoid of branches, however old they may be; whilst other branches protrude as they spring from the earth. Stlιly, There is a great difference both in the hue and figure of the leaves, as also in their size; they are bluish, ash-coloured, reddish, or mottled. Some are so large as to make very good fans. Qthly, The roots, though knotty and irregular, are found in one species to penetrate like a large tuft of filaments into the earth. ∖Qthly, There are certain singularities which distinguish the species of this piant, as excrescences from the knots, which may be eaten; a saccharine pith; and wood of a red colour and agreeable odour.\n",
      "It will easily be observed that these remarks are too general to warrant the establishment of species from all the bamboos enumerated; but it is not improbable that a plant so widely diffused may consist, as before observed, θf a greater number than has yet been recognised.\n",
      "The bamboo grows wild in most places of the East, and the warmer parts of the West, and is resorted to as occasion requires. Where the country is principally dependent on its use, it is cultivated in regular plantations, and, m more ungenial climates, preserved by the curious ln greenhouses. Its culture is different, according to soil and climate; but apparently it succeeds best in low shel-θ re d grounds, with rich, soft, spongy earth. Contact of θ root with water is reputed to be immediately destructe, and too much humidity occasions gradual decay. This plant is propagated by shoots deposited in pits at the close of autumn or commencement of winter, eighteen inches or two feet deep; and if it be designed to obtain bamboos of considerable size, the scions are cut over as they spring up. Some scrupulous cultivators among the orientals take care to preserve the plant exactly in the same position, with respect to the cardinal points, as that in which it originated. The greater the number in a plantation, the better is the chance of success, as they shelter each other in their progress. Their subsequent treatment depends entirely on the uses to which they are to be converted, whether of profit or pleasure; much care being bestowed on those designed for beauty or ornament only. They are propped up with rods of a proper height, by which they are trained and supported; and, if complete plants, cut over in order to obtain suitable shoots, which are chiefly sought after; besides, this operation makes the root strike out and take a secure hold of the ground. In a rainy season, it is always necessary to surround the plantation with a ditch, in order to drain off the superabundant humidity, which would otherwise be prejudicial. Various expedients are followed to obtain good bamboos, of which one of the most usual is to take a vigorous root, with firm wood, and transplant it, leaving only four or five inches above the joint next the ground. The cavity is then filled with a mixture of horse-litter and sulphur. According to the vigour of the root, the shoots will be more numerous; but they are destroyed at an early stage during three successive years; and those springing in the fourth resemble the parent tree. It is affirmed that no culture can obtain any thing of larger size.\n",
      "Scarcely has this plant been put in the ground before its utility becomes conspicuous. The soft and succulent shoots, when just beginning to spring, and only a few inches long, are cut over and served up at table, like asparagus. Like this vegetable, also, they are earthed over to keep them longer fit for consumption; and they afford a supply in succession during the whole year, though more abundantly in autumn. They are also salted and eaten with rice, or prepared after different other fashions. As the plant grows older, a kind of fluid of grateful taste and odour is secreted in the hollow joints, affording an agreeable beve-> rage, and in sufficient quantity to satisfy several persons. If allowed to remain in the tree, a concrete substance, highly valued for its medicinal properties, called tabaxir or tαbascheer, is produced from it. The presence of the fluid is ascertained by agitating the bamboo; after some time its quantity gradually diminishes, and then the stem is opened to reach the tabascheer. This substance, participating in nothing of a vegetable nature, has been supposed to be nearly allied to siliceous earths; it resists the impression of all acids, is indestructible by fire, and with alkalies forms a transparent glass. Notwithstanding its repute in tli t e East, we are not aware that it has yet been received into the European materia medica. Besides the tabascheer, many parts of the bamboo are said to be endowed with medicinal properties; a decoction of the leaves is recommended for coughs and sore throat; the bark for fever and vomiting; the buds as a diuretic; and a compound of the root with tobacco-leaves, betel nut, and oil, is believed to form an efficacious unguent. But setting aside its medicinal properties, it is highly valuable as an article of food, for many of the poorer classes in the most populous countries subsist on it in times of scarcity. The seed which it produces is recorded in Chinese history to have preserved the lives of thousands; the Hindoos eat it mixed with honey as a delicacy, equal quantities of each being put into a hollow joint, coated externally with clay, and thus roasted over a fire.\n",
      "From the copious draught which a joint of the bamboo naturally yields, mankind are taught its use as a vessel for carrying water, and in some places no other bucket is employed. The eastern nations build their houses solely of the wood\n",

      "a person publicly declared to be in debt beyond his power of payment. Bankruptcy is distinguishable from insolvency. An insolvent is one who owes more than he can pay; he becomes a bankrupt when that inability is proclaimed by some public or judicial proceeding.\n",
      "In England one is made bankrupt only by the issuing of a commission under the great seal, which deprives him of all his funds, and vests them in certain commissioners, to be assigned, managed, sold, and divided among his creditors.\n",
      "In Scotland a person may be made bankrupt either, 1⅛ by a judicial process called sequestration, analogous to the English commission, by which his estate and effects are taken from him and vested in a trustee, to be managed and divided among his creditors; or, ⅝Jhj, by imprisonment for debt, or by absconding, taking sanctuary, or defending himself against the officers sent to arrest him.\n",
      "The law for regulating bankruptcy has had in view chiefly, persons engaged in trade: and the object in both countries has been to preserve the funds of a debtor on the eve of failure from being secreted, or placed in the hands of confidants, or given to favourite relations; to prevent the bankrupt from dealing unequally with his creditors on the eve of his failure; to place his estates and funds under economical management, in order that they may be realised, and the price divided among his credi- t θ ascertain the true amount of his debts; to have a fair distribution made at certain terms; and to provide or the safety of the debtor’s person, where he has dealt justly with his creditors, and given up every thing fairly or their payment. There is also ingrafted upon this proceeding, in either country, a mode of stopping short, after due inquiry into the amount of the debts and value of the funds, and enabling a certain large majority of the creditors to make an agreement, which shall bind the whole, whereby the proceedings are superseded, immediate payment of part of the debts accepted as a composition for the whole, and the rest of the debt discharged. This is called a composition contract.\n",
      "Provisions have also been made in both countries for regulating the interests of creditors, and the evil of imprisonment for debt, where the insolvent debtor is not engaged in trade. A short account of the laws established in both countries for regulating both those states of insolvency may be useful.\n",
      "1. Law of Bankruptcy and Insolvency in England.— 1. Commission of bankruptcy against persons engaged in trade.— The law relating to the bankruptcy of persons engaged in trade is consolidated in one statute, 6 Geo. IV. c. 16. Where a trader or manufacturer either commits certain acts with the intent of defeating or delaying his creditors; or, having been arrested, lies for twenty days in prison; or declares himself insolvent, and gives notice thereof in the Gazette; a commission may, on the petition of a creditor making oath of debt to the amount at least of L.I00, be issued by the Lord Chancellor under the great seal, appointing certain persons called commissioners of bankrupts to take order and direction with the body of the bankrupt, and his lands, estates, and funds of all kinds, and to make sale thereof for payment and satisfaction to the creditors. Notice is immediately published in the Gazette, and certain days are named, on whieh the bankrupt is to appear before the commissioners, and be examined in presence of his creditors; and the creditors are to appear and prove their debts, the commissioners having large inquisitorial powers for discovery of the bankrupt’s funds. After the creditors have proved their debts, they are empowered to choose trustees, to whom the estate shall be assigned by the commissioners, in order to be sold and converted into money for division; and among the estates and funds so to be assigned are comprehended, lsŕ, all goods and chattels in the possession, order, disposition, and reputed ownership, of the bankrupt; 2√, all lands, debts, goods, &c. which, after insolvency, and without adequate consideration, the bankrupt shall have conveyed or transferred to his children or others; 3íZ, all property and effects transferred or affected by contracts or other dealings, or by executions or attachments subsequent to an act of bankruptcy, provided the party concerned have had notice of such act of bankruptcy, or that it shall have taken place within two calendar months of the commission. The assignees are ordered to make dividends among the creditors at certain periods, as the funds shall be realized, notice being given in the Gazette; and the bankrupt may be discharged from all his debts on procuring a certificate signed by a certain proportion of his creditors in number and value, and having it sanctioned by the Lord Chancellor, on hearing any objections which may be stated against the discharge. But no bankrupt can thus be discharged who has lost money at play, or by stockjobbing, to a certain amount; or who has destroyed his books, or made false entries, or concealed his property, or been privy to the proving of fictitious debts on his estate. Finally, the whole proceeding under the commission may be superseded by the Lord Chancellor, if, after the bankrupt shall have passed his last examination, proof shall be given to him of an offer of composition made by the bankrupt or his friends, and acceded to by nine tenths of the creditors in number and value.\n",
      "2. Insolvency.— Provision has at various times been  made in England, by occasional or temporary acts, for relieving insolvent persons not within the bankrupt laws, imprisoned for debt. But in 1820 a new court was established for the purpose of affording permanently the means of such relief, 1 Geo. IV. c. 119, and 5 Geo. IV. c. 61. The court consists of a chief and three commissioners, to sit in London, called the Court for relief of Insolvent Debtors. Any person in custody for debt within the walls of a prison in England is entitled to apply to this court, by summary petition, for his discharge from prison, and to have future liberty of his person from all debts due by him at the date of the petition, upon delivering a correct schedule of all his debts, and of all property and assets of every kind, and assigning every thing (except wearing apparel, bedding, &c. to the value oí L∙20), to the officer of the court, for the satisfaction of his creditors; to be by him made over to assignees appointed by the court, to sell and distribute the proceeds. Provision is made for due notice to the creditors, for the investigation of debts claimed, for the proper disposal of all the property, for the duly accounting of the assignees; and all conveyances and preferences given to creditors within three months are declared void. The prisoner’s right to a discharge from prison is to be judged of by the court, on hearing the creditors and examining the prisoner; and the court is empowered to discharge him from prison if satisfied with his conduct, or to prolong his imprisonment in their discretion (not, however, exceeding three years), where he has concealed funds, destroyed books, &c. The court has power, where the debtor is not to be discharged, to order the creditor or creditors at whose suit he is detained, to pay to the prisoner a sum not exceeding four shillings by the week, on failure of which the prisoner is to be discharged. To avoid the expense of proceedings in London, the court may order the investigations to proceed in the court-house of the assize-town of the county; one of the commissioners of the court there attending, with all the powers of the court. And the court may appoint examiners to assist in the necessary investigations in counties. A prisoner found entitled to the benefit of the act is not liable to imprisonment for debts due previous to these proceedings, unless he shall succeed to or acquire property, and refuse to assign it to the assignees, for the benefit of his creditors; in which case the assignees may· a Pply 1° have him remanded to prison; and provision is made for compelling the debtor to submit to examination as to property subsequently acquired.\n",
      "II. Law of Bankruptcy and Insolvency in Scotland.—\n",
      "1. Bankruptcy of persons engaged in trade.— By 54 Geo. III. c. 137, a judicial proceeding, called sequestration, is authorized to be issued by the Court of Session, on the petition of an insolvent trader or manufacturer in Scotland, with concurrence of a creditor swearing to a debt of L.100, or of a creditor to that amount without the concurrence of the debtor, provided the insolvency have been followed by imprisonment, absconding, or taking sanetuary, or by the execution of certain judicial warrants, if he be privileged from arrest. By this process the whole estates and effects of the debtor, real and personal, are placed under sequestration, to the effect of being made over to a trustee, as soon as the creditors can meet and choose a fit person; for which purpose a day is appointed, and notice given in the Gazette. The property is in the meanwhile managed by a factor, appointed by the creditors; and the trustee, when chosen, has the whole property assigned to him, and is entitled to recover, for the benefit of the creditors, all property and effects made over to confidential persons after insolvency, or conveyed to creditors in satisfaction or security of previous debts, within two months before sequestration or imprisonment. The trustee’s duty is to bring the whole estate to sale, with certain precautions; to receive and investigate the claims 1 of the creditors, and to reject or admit them, subject to review of the Court of Session by summary petition. At certain appointed times he is required to make successive dividends, till the whole funds shall be exhausted. The debtor and his family must submit to public examinations on oath before the sheriff of the county in which his trade was carried on; and he may receive a judicial protection from arrest, if four fifths \n",

      "a celebrated German writer, born at Hamburg, the 11th September 1723, was the son of a hair-dresser. Ill treatment made him abandon his father’s house. A physician in a neighbouring village took him into his service, and shortly after persuaded him to return home to his father. Being placed in one of the lower classes of the college of St John, the severity of his masters rendered him harsh and violent himself. Forced to submit to a slow and rigorous method of study, he contracted a dislike to patience and regularity, which exercised a marked influence over the whole course of his life. Boor but intelligent, he often performed their tasks for his school-fellows who could afford to pay for it; and they, in return, invited him to their parties of pleasure, which contributed to those habits of irregularity by which ms health and reputation often suffered. In 1744 Basedow went to Leipsic to study theology. He gave himself u P entirely to the instructions of the professor, Crusius, and the study of philosophy. This at first made him sceptical in theology; a more profound examination of the sacred writings, and of all that relates to them, brought ım back to the Christian faith; but, in his retirement, he ιoιr∏ed his belief after his own ideas, and it was far from orthodox. Having returned to Hamburg, he 1 ved there without any employment till 1749, when M. de Quaalen, privy-counsellor of Holstein, appointed him preceptor to ħis son. Basedow now began to apply himself to the subject of education. At first he would not teach his pupil Latin otherwise than by talking with him in Latin; and he wrote a dissertation on this subject, published at Kiel in 1751, Inusitata et optima honestioris Juventutis erudienda Methodo. In 1753 he was chosen professor of moral philosophy and belles lettres in the academy of Soroë in Denmark. Here he published in 1758 his Practical Philosophy for all Conditions, in two volumes (Copenhagen and Leipsic, second edition, in 1777), which contained many good observations on education in general, and on that of girls in particular; but he advanced in it opinions by no means consistent with Lutheran orthodoxy, so that the Count Danneskiold, superintendent of the academy, took his place from him, and removed him to the school of exercises at Altona. Basedow still continued to devote himself to theological studies. In 1764 he published his Philalethes, or New Considerations on the Truth of Religion and Reason, within the Limits of Revelation, two volumes in 8vo. The magistrates of Altona forbade the reading of this work. He was not allowed any longer permission to print his writings at Hamburg or Lubeck; the communion was prohibited to him and all his family, and the common people were on the point of stoning him. Basedow, however, was convinced of the truth of his opinions, and displayed prodigious activity in defending them. He wrote his Methodical Instruction in Religion, and the Morality of Reason, Altona, 1764; his Theoretical System, of Sound Reason, 1765; his Essay on Free Dogmatism, Berlin, 1766; his Extracts from the Old and New Testament, and his Essay in Favour of the Truth of Christianity, in the same year. The last of these works he particularly valued himself upon, because he there founds the evidence of Christianity chiefly on its moral purity. In these and other works, however, he maintained several heterodox opinions, as the non-eternity of future punishments; the inequality of the three persons of the Trinity; the insufficiency of the atonement for our sins by the death of Jesus Christ, &c. Constantly persecuted in his theological career, he would have fallen the victim of his incautious zeal, if the count de Bernstoff, minister of state, and J. A. Cramer, another officer of the court of Copenhagen, had not taken him under their protection. He left off giving lessons without losing his salary; and, towards the end of 1767, he abandoned theology to devote himself with the same ardour to education, of which he conceived the project of a general reform in Germany. He began by publishing An Address to the Friends of Humanity, and to Persons in Power, on Schools, on Education, and its Influence on Public Happiness, with the Plan of an Elementary Treatise on Human Knowledge. Hamburg, 1768. He proposed the reform of schools, of the common methods of instruction, the establishment of an institute for qualifying teachers, and solicited subscriptions for the printing of his elementary work, where his principles were to be explained at length, and accompanied with plates. For this object he required 5050 crowns. The subscriptions presently amounted to 15,000 crowns: the empress of Russia, Catherine IL, sent a thousand crowns, the king of Denmark nine hundred. In 1770 appeared at Altona the first volume of his Method for Fathers and Mothers of Families, and for the Chiefs of the People; and, six months after, the first three parts of his Elementary Treatise, in 8vo, with 54 plates. This work, which was praised in all the journals, was translated into French by Huber, and into Latin by Mangelsdorf; but Schlozer, in the German translation of the Essay on National Education by Μ. de la Chalotais, accused Basedow of having omitted in his plan various Dranches of science, and of having had in view only a pecuniary speculation. Basedow, in despair, offered to return the price of his book to those who were not satisfied with it. Only one man, a Swiss, demanded his subscription. Encouraged by the success of the Treatise, our author continued to write other works on the same subject and on the same principles; among others, his Treatise on Arithmetic, 1773, and Elements of pure Mathematics, 1772. His Agathocratοr, or the Education of Teachers to come, 1771, procured him a medal from the emperor Joseph II.; and the visits which he made to Brunswick, to Leipsic, Dessau, Berlin, and Halle, to inquire into the state of public instruction, having enabled him to enlarge and correct his ideas, and convinced him that his elementary work contained many erroneous and hasty assertions, he published a new and improved edition of this work in 1774. The same year he published his Legacy for Consciences, or Manual of Natural and Revealed Religion; a work which he composed in order to make known the real state of his religious opinions, and to clear himself from the imputation of wishing to found a new sect. In his travels he had been well received by the prince of Anhalt-Dessau, who promised him his protection. From that time he had resolved to establish an institute for education at Dessau, and to apply his principles himself in forming disciples, who might spread them over all Germany. Little calculated by nature or habit to succeed in an employment which requires the greatest regularity, patience, and attention, he, however, engaged in this new project with all his accustomed ardour. The name of Philanthropinon appeared to him the most expressive of his views; and he published at Leipsic in 1774 a pamphlet, entitled The Philanthropinon founded at Dessau, containing the details of his plan. He immediately set about carrying it into execution; but he had few scholars, and the success by no means answered his hopes. The institution, badly managed, became a theatre of quarrels between Basedow and the masters who taught in it under his direction. The assistance of the celebrated Campe, a journal which they both composed together, under the title of School Dialogues, from 1777 to 1779, and a public examination which went off with eclat, gave a transient splendour to the Philanthropinon; but in a short time Basedow quarrelled with Campe, made complaints against his prince, quitted and returned to the care of the institution, and exemplifying in his conduct the effects of coarse manners and bad temper, was at length drawn into the most scandalous scenes in his disputes with Professor Wolke, his former coadjutor. This institution was finally shut up in 1793. Basedow for some time had given up all thoughts of education; he returned to his old theological inquiries, and residing sometimes at Magdeburg, sometimes at Halle, sometimes at Leipsic, he took part in the famous controversy excited in Germany by the Fragments of Wolfenbutel, an anonymous posthumous work of Reimarus, published by Lessing. Doctor Semler having written a pretended refutation of the Fragments, Basedow, without difficulty, exposed the ill intentions of the author, who secretly attacked the cause he affected to defend; and, with his usual vehemence and franκness, called upon Semler to declare himself openly, offering to indemnify him with his fortune if this public declaration should prove prejudicial to him. Semler made no reply, and Basedow wrote on. He published his work entitled Jesus Christ, the Christian World, and the small Number of the Elect, in 1784; and the year following, returning to the study which had divided his time and his powers with theology, he gave the public his Neιν Method of Learning to Read, which he employed with success in two schools of little girls at Magdeburg; and in this occupation he passed four hours every day for some time previous to his death, which took place in that city, on the 25th July 1790. He died with Christian firmness and resignation, and desired that his body might be opened wishing, to use his own words, to be still useful to his fellow-citizens after his death. In 1797 a monument of marble was erected on the spot where he was buried.\n",
      "To manners unpolished and abrupt he joined gross habits; he was fond of wine, of which he drank to excess ∙ in short, with a character in itself unamiable, he seemed by his conduct sometimes to take pains to render his services of no use, and his virtues of no account. Nothing can give a better idea of him than what he says of himself: “The sagacious reader will discover by my writinα∙s that I have been especially called to serve the cause of truth and humanity, in following\n",

      "bastardus (fancifully derived from the Greek βαwαξ∣ς, meretrix, but with more reason from the British bastaerd, nothus, spurius, or from the German bastart, composed of bas, low, and start, risen, Saxon steort, an upstart, homo nοvus), one whose father and mother were not lawfully married previous to his or her birth, or, as it has sometimes been loosely expressed, one bom out of lawful wedlock.\n",
      "The civil and canon laws do notallow a child to remain a bastard if the parents afterwards intermarry; and this is also the law of Scotland, in which the principle of legitimation by subsequent marriage has been often and solemnly recognised. But herein they differ most materially from the English law; which, though not so strict as to require that a child shall be begotten, yet makes it an indispensable condition that it shall be born after lawful wedlock. Blackstone thinks that the reason of the English law is in this respect much superior to that of the Roman or of the derivative systems, if the principal end and design of establishing the contract of marriage, taken in a civil light, be considered; but this opinion, however natural in an English lawyer, does not seem to be borne out by considerations either of principle or of expediency. For although the learned commentator may be perfectly correct in his estimate of the motives which actuated the parliament of Merton when they refused to enact that children born in bastardy should be legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their parents; yet the question still remains whether such an enactment would not have been highly beneficial on grounds of public policy, as well as for the protection of private morals, and whether the experience since acquired has not decided in its favour; points concerning which lawyers, in Scotland at least, have long ceased to entertain any doubt.\n",
      "But be this as it may, one thing is certain, that all children born before matrimony are bastards by our law; and so are all children born so long after the death of the husband, that by the usual course of gestation, they could not be begotten by him. But this being a matter of some uncertainty, the law is not exact as to a few days; and although the child is born some time after the usual period of forty weeks, this only affords presumption, not proof, of illegitimacy.^[1. According to information furnished by the late celebrated anatomist Dr John Hunter, it appears, líí, That the usual period of gestation is nine calendar months, or from 270 to 280 days; but there is very commonly a difference of one, two, or three weeks. 2dZy, That a child may be born alive at any time three months after conception, but none are born with powers of being reared or attaining manhood before seven calendar months or thereby. 3dZy, That he, Dr Hunter, had known a woman bear a living child, in ≡ perfectly natural way, fourteen days beyond the completion of nine calendar months; and he believed that two women had each been delivered of a living child, in a natural way, above ten calendar months from the hour of conception. It is owing to these natural irregularities that the law has been obliged to admit of considerable latitude in the application of the ordinary rule. ] But if a man dies, and his widow soon after marries again, and a child is born within such a time as that by the course of nature it might have been the child of either husband; in this case he is said to be more than ordiñarily legitimate, for when he arrives at years of discretion, he may choose which of the fathers he pleases. To prevent this, among other inconveniences, however, the civil law ordained that no widow should marry intra annum luctus; a rule which obtained as early as the reign of Augustus, if not of father Romulus himself; and the same constitution was probably handed down to our early ancestors from the Romans, during their stay in this island, since we find it established under both the Saxon and the Danish governments.\n",
      "But as bastards may be born before the coverture or marriage state is begun, or after it is determined, so also children born during wedlock may in some circumstances be bastards; as if the husband be out of the kingdom of England, or, as the law loosely phrases it, extra quatuor maria, for above nine months, so that no access to his wife can be presumed, her issue during that period is to be accounted bastard. But generally during the coverture, access of the husband is presumed, unless the contrary be shown; which is such a negative as can only be proved by showing him to be elsewhere; for the general rule is, ρr(esu∙ miturpro leqitimatione. In a divorce a mensa et tοro, if ^ ιe wife has children they are bastards, because the law presumes the husband and wife conformable to the sentence of separation, unless access be proved; but in a voluntary separation by agreement, the law supposes access, unless the negative be shown. If a man or woman marry a second wife or husband, the first being living, and have issue by such second wife or husband, the issue is spurious. Again, if a man has issue a son by a woman before marriage, and afterwards marries the same woman and has issue a second son born after the marriage; the first of these, who would be legitimated per subsequens matrimonium in Scotland, is termed in England a bastard eigne, and, by the common law of that country, is as incapable of inheriting as if his father and mother had never married; the second, by a species of legal Hibernicism, is denominated a mulier or mulier puisne, and succeeds to the exclusion of the bastard eigne. Again, if there be an apparent impossibility of procreation on the part of the husband, as if he be only eight years old, or the like, then the issue of the wife is bastard. Likewise, in case of divorce in the spiritual court a vinculo matrimonii, all the issue born during the coverture is bastard; because such divorce is always upon some cause that rendered the marriage unlawful and null from the beginning.\n",
      "The duty of parents to their bastard children consists principally in maintaining them. For although bastards are not looked upon as children to any civil purpose, yet the ties of nature, of which maintenance is one, are not so easily dissolved; and these hold good even in other respects, as, for example, that a man shall not marry his bastard sister or daughter. The provisions of the law of England on this head are numerous; but those of most importance maybe very briefly enumerated. Two justices of the peace may make an order on the mother or reputed father of a bastard, to maintain the infant by weekly payments or otherwise; and if the party on whom the order is made disobey, he or she may be committed to jail until they give security to perform it. The reputed father of a bastard is chargeable with the expenses incident to the birth, and of his own apprehension, and of the order of filiation; and although no legal relationship subsists between the putative father and the bastard,· the former is so far considered its natural guardian, as to be entitled to the custody of it for its maintenan.ee and education.\n",
      "The rights of a bastard are very few, being only such as he can acquire; for civilly he can inherit nothing, being looked upon as the son of nobody, and sometimes called filius nullius, sometimes filius populi. Yet he may gain a surname by reputation though he has none by inheritance, and may even be made legitimate and capable of inheriting by the transcendent power of an act of parliament. All other children have their primary settlement in their father’s parish; but a bastard has his in the parish where he was born, unless such birth has been procured by fraud, or happened under an order of removal, in a State of vagrancy, in the house of correction, or under Certificate; for in law he has no father. The incapacities attaching to a bastard consist principally in this, that he cannot be heir to any one; for being nullius filius, he is therefore of kin to nobody, and has no ancestor from whom an inheritable blood can be derived. Therefore, if there be no other claimant upon an inheritance than such illegitimate child, it escheats to the lord. And as bastards cannot be heirs themselves, so neither can they have any heirs but those of their own bodies. For as all collateral kindred consists in being derived from the same common ancestor, and as a bastard has no legal ancestor, he can have no collateral kindred, and consequently no legal heirs, ¶xcept such as claim by a lineal descent from himself. And hence, if a bastard purchase land, and die seised thereof without issue, and intestate, the land escheats to the lord of the fee. Originally a bastard was deemed incapable of holy orders, and disqualified by the fact of his birth from holding any dignity in the church; but this doctrine is now obsolete, and in all other respects there is no distinction between a bastard and another man.\n",
      "These are the principal incapacities attaching to bastardy in England. By the law of Scotland a bastard is not only excluded from his father’s succession, because the law knows no father who is not marked out by marriage; and from all heritable succession, whether by the father or mother, because he cannot be pronounced lawful heir by the inquest in terms of the brief; but also from the movable succession of his mother, because he is not her lawful child, and legitimacy is implied in all succession deferred by the law. But a bastard, although he cannot succeed jure sanguinis, may succeed by destination, where he is specially called to the succession by entail or testament. In Scotland, as in England, a bastard can have no legal heirs except those of his own body; and hence, failing his lawful issue, the king succeeds to him as last heir. In Scotland bastards may be legitimated in two ways; either by the subsequent intermarriage of the mother of the child with the father, as already mentioned; or by letters of legitimation from the sover\n",

      "a people of the northern part of Hindostan, inhabiting a country which extends about 200 miles in length and 100 in breadth, and of which the capital is Batncar, situated, according to some authorities 170, and according to others 219 miles west-north-west of Delhi. This country comprehends part of the province of Delhi, Lahore, and Ajmeer.\n",
      "The Batties present many peculiarities in manners and customs, distinguishing them from the other people of Hindostan. They seem to consist of three different races; the chief are Rajpoot Mahommedans; the common people Jauts, who have adopted the same religion; and the cultivators of the soil are called Ryots, a very peaceable and inoffensive class. But in general they are characterized as shepherds; and although principally restricted to the territory whence their name is derived, various tribes of them are to be found in the Punjab, and they are also scattered over the high grounds to the east of the Indus. But great obscurity prevails in every thing regarding them.\n",
      "The Batties are Mahommedans, and highly venerate the memory of a certain saint, Scheik Fereed, who flourished in the fifteenth century; and it is said that, however adverse to their natural disposition, should any one, in invoking his name, claim their protection, it is never withheld. Yet their customs, in other respects, are at variance with those of the Mahommedans, particularly in the females appearing, without any reserve, unveiled in public, and in their associating promiscuously with the men, as in other countries. The wives of the Rajpoot chiefs form an exception; and it is reported among these Rajpoots, that their ancestors migrated some centuries ago from the district of Jessulmere, and, after various vicissitudes, settled in the Batnear country. Most of the inhabitants under their rule were originally Jauts, dwelling on the western bank of the river Sutledge, in the twenty-ninth degree of north latitude, and who have not been known long in the portion of the peninsula now occupied by them. Having embraced the Mahommedan faith, they were invited by an ancestor of the rajah of the Batties, about a century ago, to cross the river and settle in his country, where their posterity still reside. The Jauts constitute the lower orders of the people, and are treated with great moderation by their superiors.\n",
      "The whole territory, extending as above described, is apparently under the dominion of a supreme prince or rajah, whose authority is acknowledged by inferior chiefs or rajahs; for the term rajah, in strictness, applies to none  but those invested with a paramount rule. This potentate can bring 20,000 or 30,000 men into the field, but they are quite undisciplined, and despise the necessary principle of subordination. His revenue chiefly arises from the plundering of his troops, for thcir wars are directed more to predatory purposes than to open contest; and the rajah, instead of repressing the ravages of this immense banditti, willingly participates in the spoils. When strangers observed to him that the soil and agriculture of his country were sufficient to enable his subjects to enjoy plenty, he replied, that the number of Rajpoots in his service was so considerable, compared with the mass of the people, that, should he attempt to restrain the depredations of the latter, the subversion of his own authority might ensue, because it would be interfering with old and established customs. The rajah who made this remark was in every respect a good and humane character.\n",
      "But the people over whom he rules are by no means entitled to the same repute; they are of a cruel, savage, and ferocious disposition; they entertain an utter abhorrence of the usages of civilized life; they arc thieves from their earliest infancy, and, during their predatory incursions into the neighbouring districts, do not scruple, though unresisted, to add murder to robbery. This systematic plundering produces a revenue of above L.120,000 per annum to their princes; at least that is the conjectural amount, for there are no data whereon to found exact calculations.\n",
      "Many of the Batties appear to be entirely nomadic, changing their residence from place to place, as subsistence fails. Their exports are horses, camels, bullocks, buffaloes, and ghee; and they sell some surplus grain above what is necessary for their own consumption; but their traffic is very inconsiderable, and what they do carry on is with the petty merchants of Behadra, Nohur, and other towns, through the means of the disciples of the !Scheik Fereed, their favourite saint. A large portion of the country is unproductive; but along the banks of the river Cuggur, from Batnear to the town of Futtahbad, the soil is uncommonly rich, and well adapted for cultivation. The inundations of this river fertilize its banks, and the subsidence of the waters leaves them to a great distance prepared for plentiful crops of wheat, rice, and barley, amply rewarding the labours of the husbandman. It is the scarcity of water which occasions the barrenness of the ground; nevertheless, more is raised than the inhabitants can consume. Their horses are numerous; but it is computed that they lose a fourth of them annually by the sting or bite of a winged insect, the injured part degenerating into an incurable cancerous sore.\n",
      "We are unacquainted with any river of note in this district, excepting the Cuggur, which is lost in the sands to the westward. According to the tradition of the natives, it changed its course in consequence of its original bed having been choked up by immense quantities of earth forced down from the mountains.\n",
      "Γhe capital of the Batties is Batnear, which lies in a situation almost inaccessible to an enemy; for no water is to be procured within twelve miles, but what supplies the inhabitants; however, it was taken in 1398 by Timour, and more recently by General Thomas. Their other principal towns are Arroa, Futtahbad, Sirsa, and Ramgah; and there are many forts, which, though defenceless against the skill of European troops, are impregnable to the irregular marauders of Hindostan. Numbers of the Batties have latterly emigrated from their native country, to establish themselves in the western parts of the dominions of Oude; and several families of them are to be met with in Rohilcund. They are practised travellers, and well trained to emigration by the laborious journeys undertaken in crossing the great desert to the west of their territories. These expeditions are frequently made in large parties, for the purpose of a predatory incursion on some peaceable country more remote; and they exemplify both skill and determination in attaining their object. Camels previously laden with provisions are dispatched to different stations in the desert, which is about 130 miles in breadth, and their loads deposited there. The most intelligent of the party about to follow are selected as guides, and receive the most implicit obedience from their companions during the journey, which closes at the frontier of the hostile country, or rather that against which their hostility is directed. The guides, by long experience, become expert without compass or land-mark, and seldom fail to conduct the party to the appointed station where the provisions are deposited, and thence across the remainder of the desert in safety. But should they accidentally miss the points of rendezvous, or those where alone their necessities can be relieved, they are exposed to inevitable destruction; and any of their party heedlessly straying from the rest become the victims of the accumulated evils of hunger, thirst, and fatigue. The adventurers steer their course by the sun in the day-time, and by the polar star at night; and by similar aids they are enabled to retrace the way they have travelled. Should provisions fail, a bullock is killed, roasted, and partitioned on the spot, and, after a hasty meal, the journey is resumed.\n",
      "The history of the Batties has attracted the notice of few European authors. They seem to carry on frequent wars with neighbouring states, and are the most formidable enemies that oppose the rajah of Beykaneer. The latter invaded their territories in the beginning of the present century, but without success, which is not surprising, considering the comparative smallness of the force which he can bring into the field, and the nature of the country. Temporary advantages were, notwithstanding, obtained over the Batties, and the Beykaneer rajah erected a fortress in Batinda, which, if not within their territory, is on its immediate confines. This contributed to overawe them for a time, and repressed their incursions into his own dominions; as, independently of the garrison, he stationed a large body of cavalry in the fort, whose frequent sallies and captures of cattle annoyed the Batties so much that they contemplated a total emigration from their own country. Buta military adventurer, George Thomas, an Irishman by birth, who, endowed with singular talents and intrepidity, had founded for himself an independent state in the north-west of India, was then at war with the province of Beykaneer. Having reached its frontiers, the Batties solicited his alliance, and, to induce him to espouse their cause the more readily, offered him 40,000 rupees, if he would reduce the obnoxious fort. It appears that the Beyka∏eer forces were now masters of Batnear, the capital, whither General Thomas, who had accepted the proposals of the Batties, marched to dislodge them. He found a numerous garrison, and, having brought up his artillery, began to batter the place, preparatory to an assault. This, however, the enemy avoided by capitulation, and they were allowed to evacuate the city with the honours of war, while the Batties immediately took possession of it. In further prosecution of the war, several actions ensued, and various fortresses were taken; but it would appear, that one of the Battie chiefs, at variance with General Thoma\n",

      "an action or engagement between the forces of two armies. A battle is either general or partial; general, where the whole, or at least the greater part, of each army is brought into action; and partial, where only brigades, divisions, or corps d’armée are engaged. But, however the numbers may vary, the great principles to be applied in délivering battle are in almost every case the same.\n",
      "It has indeed been said, by a high military authority, that there is nothing invariable in the art of combats; and, looking to the endless diversity of circumstances under which battles have been fought, as well as to the apparent results, which are often at variance with the profoundest calculations of science, the observation would seem to have some foundation in truth. But a closer examination will be sufficient to convince us that this is not the case, and that the maxim in question, like many others which pass current in the world, involves a fallacy equally glaring and dangerous. It is no doubt true that, in the circumstances under which battles are fought, there is nothing invariable; on the contrary, it is scarcely possible to suppose two cases, we do not say alike in every particular, but resembling each other even in their great or leading features. From the very nature of things, the data of the problem are variable; but the grand principles by which the solution is to be evolved continue immutably the same. The elements which enter into the calculations of a general are constantly changing; and it is this circumstance which affords scope for the exercise of his genius, his sagacity, and his military science. But it would be manifestly absurd to maintain, that because the conditions are incessantly diversified, the principles of the art experience equal mutations. The issue of battle is always uncertain; because the calculations of the general may be defective, his combinations unscientific, his foresight limited, or his temperament rash and impetuous; and because, even where none of these causes of failure exist, events which no human sagacity could have divined may occur to defeat the wisest plans and the ablest dispositions. But all this implies, that if every thing could have been foreseen and provided for, the result would not have been doubtful; and that the “grand chances” are always on the side of him who forms his plan with the greatest sagacity, and executes it with corresponding vigour and ability. For, variable as the results of battles appear, the most decisive success has generally crowned the exertions of the greatest commanders; and victory in the long-run has seldom failed to pay homage to science. There is nothing, therefore, invariable in the art of combats, except those principles which science has established as, mutatis mutandis, universally applicable.\n",
      "A battle is not only the most imposing, but also the most important event in war. It is the consummation to which all the previous combinations of commanders necessarily tend; it is that grand act of war which may decide the fate of kingdoms and empires, as well as that of armies and campaigns. The highest and dearest interests of nations, nay even of humanity itself, may be involved in its issue; and the mighty cause of civilization may be accelerated or retarded according as the scales of the battle turn. It cannot, therefore, we should think, be uninteresting or uninstructive, if we endeavour, by recurring to the works of the great masters, to exhibit a condensed digest of those general principles, by the skilful application of which the fate of battles, in all ages, has more or less been determined.\n",
      "All the combinations of a battle may be reduced to three systems. The first, which is purely defensive, consists in waiting for the enemy in a strong position, without any other object than that of maintaining it against him. Such were the dispositions of Marshal Daun at Torgau, and of the Comte de Marsin in the lines at Turin; dispositions, we may add, which proved wholly unavailing against Frederick and Eugene, and forcibly exemplify the danger of receiving an attack even in the strongest position. The second system, on the other hand, is entirely offensive. It consists in attacking the enemy wherever he can be found, as Frederick did at Leuthen and at Torgau, Buonaparte at Jena and at Ratisbon, and the allied armies at Leipsic. The third system is in some sort a mean term between the first and second. It consists in choosing a field of battle possessing certain advantages both in a strategical and tactical point of view, in order to wait there for the enemy, and, even in the day of battle, to watch the favourable moment for assuming the initiative, and falling upon the adversary with every chance of success. The combinations of Buonaparte at Rivoli and at Austerlitz, and those of Wellington at Waterloo, as well as in the greater part of his defensive battles during the peninsular war, are examples of the mixed system, and must therefore be classed under this head.\n",
      "It would be difficult, not to say impossible, to lay down any fixed rules for determining when either of these two last systems, which are the only suitable ones, ought to be employed. Regard must be had to the moral condition of the troops of each party; to the national character, considered as more or less solid or impetuous; and, lastly, to the obstacles presented by the ground. These are circumstances which must always influence the decision of a general; but allowing sufficient latitude for such considerations, the following principles will nevertheless be found generally applicable: lóŕ, That with veteran troops, and in an open country, the absolute offensive or initiative of attack is always most advantageous; 2<∕∕y, That in ground which, by reason of its physical conformation or other causes, is of difficult access, the better course is to allow the enemy to arrive in a position which has been previously reconnoitred, and to assume the initiative as soon as his troops shall have been exhausted by their first efforts; 3<7Zy∕, That the strategical situation of the two parties may nevertheless sometimes require that the positions of an adversary be attacked by main force, without regard to any local consideration whatever; as, for example, when it is necessary to prevent the junction of two hostile armies, or to fall upon a portion of an army detached, or upon a corps isolated beyond a river. In these and in all similar cases a skilful general will direct an immediate and combined attack, without concerning himself about any consideration extrinsic to the main object of overwhelming the body opposed to him before it can be reinforced.\n",
      "Orders of battle, or the dispositions best suited for conducting troops to the combat, ought to have for their object to insure at once mobility and solidity; and hence they ought neither to be too extended nor too profound. An-attenuated order is weak: and troops crowded together in too dense an order are paralyzed; for as the head of the mass only is engaged, disorder is easily introduced, and the enemy’s artillery causes frightful ravages. To avoid this double evil, and to fulfil both the conditions of a good order of battle, troops which remain upon the defensive should be partly deployed and partly in columns of battalions, like the Russian army under Beningsen at the battle of Eylau. But troops disposed for the attack of a decisive point ought to be drawn up in two lines of battalions, each of which, instead of being deployed, should be formed in columns by divisions. This order presents infinitely more solidity than a deployed line, the fluctuations of which deprive it of the impulsion necessary for such an attack, and render it impossible for the officers to exercise the necessary control over the troops. Nevertheless, in order to facilitate the march, to avoid too great depth in the mass, and to extend the front without materially lessening the consistence of an army, it may be advantageous to draw up the infantry in two ranks. The battalions will thus possess greater mobility; and, besides, they will have all the force desirable, since the three divisions deployed will possess six ranks in depth, which is more than sufficient; while the extended front will increase in a corresponding ratio the effect of the musketry. In grounds of difficult access, as vineyards, inclosures, gardens, and wooded heights, the defensive order of battle should be composed of battalions deployed, covered by numerous platoons of sharpshooters. But the troops destined tor the attack, as well aş the reserve, maybe advantageous y disposed in columns of attack by the centre. The reserve, however, may be kept in part deployed until the mome∏∙\n",

      "of advance, in order, by its apparent extent, to impose on the enemy. In a defensive battle upon open ground, squares of battalions may be substituted for columns, by doubling the lines of two ranks so as to form four deep; and each battalion will thus present a sufficient mass, with a front varying from forty to fifty files. This order, which was that employed by the duke of Wellington at Waterloo, appears advantageous when there is reason to apprehend attacks of cavalry; for it affords at once safety to the infantry, and protection to the cannoneers and train of artillery. But as it has both less mobility and less impulsion than that in columns of attack, the latter has been judged preferable; because, with well-disciplined troops, squares may be easily formed in each battalion by a simple conversion to the right and left of the division of the centre. The duke of Wellington, it is true, commonly fought deployed; but, to say nothing of the incomparable military qualities of his troops, his lines were generally formed four deep; so that, after all, the exception is more apparent than real.\n",

      "author of the Historical and Critical Dictionary, was born on the 18th of November 1647, at Carla, a village in the county of Foix, in France, where his father, John Bayle, was a Protestant minister. In 1666 he went to the Protestant university at Puylaurens, where he studied with the greatest application; and in 1669 he removed to the university of Toulouse, whither the Protestants at that time frequently sent their children to study under the Jesuits; but here, to the inexpressible grief of his father, he embraced the Romish religion. However, being soon sensible of his error, he left that university and went to study at Geneva, after which he was chosen professor of philosophy at Sedan; but this Protestant university having been suppressed by Louis XIV. in 1681, he was obliged to leave the city, and was soon after chosen professor of philosophy and history at Rotterdam. The year following he published his Letter concerning Comets. And Father Maimbourg having about this time published his History of Calvinism, in which he endeavoured to draw upon the Protestants the contempt and resentment of the Catholics, Mr Bayle wrote a piece to confute it. The reputation which he had now acquired induced the states of Friesland, in 1684, to offer him a professorship in their university; but he wrote them a letter of thanks, and declined the offer. The same year he began to publish his Nouvelles de la République des Lettres.\n",
      "In 1686 he was drawn into a dispute in relation to the celebrated Christina, queen of Sweden. In his Journal for April he took notice of a printed letter supposed to have been written by her Swedish majesty to the chevalier de Terlon, in which she condemns the persecution of the Protestants in France. He inserted the letter itself in his Journal for May; and in that of June following he says, “What we hinted at last month is confirmed to us from day to day, that Christina is the real author of the letter concerning the persecutions in France, which is ascribed to her: it is a remainder of Protestantism.” Mr Bayle received an anonymous letter, complaining that, in speaking of her majesty, he had called her simply Christina, without any title; finding great fault with his describing the letter as “a remainder of Protestantism ;” and blaming him likewise for inserting the words “I am,” in the conclusion. “These words,” says this anonymous writer, “are not her majesty’s; a queen, as she is, cannot employ these words but with regard to a very few persons, and Μ. de Terlon is not of that number.” The author of this letter stated that he wrote of his own accord, being in duty bound to do so, “as a servant of the queen.” Mr Bayle wrote a vindication of himself as to these particulars with which the author of the anonymous letter declared himself satisfied, excepting what related to “the remainder of Protestantism.” He would not admit the validity of the defence in regard to that expression, and in another letter advised Mr Bayle to retract it. He adds in a postscript, “You mention, in your Journal of August, a second letter of the queen, which you scruple to publish. Her majesty would be glad to see that letter; and you will do a thing agreeable to her if you would send it to her. You might take this opportunity of writing to her majesty. This counsel may be of some use to you; do not neglect it.” Mr Bayle took the hint, and wrote a letter to her majesty, dated the 14th of November 1686, to which the queen, on the 14th of December, returned the following answer :—\n",
      "“Mr Bayle, I have received your excuses, and am willing you should know by this letter that I am satisfied with them. I am obliged to the zeal of the person who gave you occasion of writing to me, for I am very glad to know you. You express so much respect and affection for me, that I pardon you sincerely; and I would have you know, that nothing gave me offence but that remainder of Protestantism, of which you accused me. 1 am very delicate on that head, because nobody can suspect me of it without lessening my glory, and injuring me in the most sensible manner. You would do well if you should even acquaint the public with the mistake you have made, and with your regret for it. This is all that remains to be done by you, in order to deserve my being entirely satisfied with you. As to the letter which you have sent me, it is mine without doubt; and since you tell me that it is printed, you will do me a pleasure if you send me some copies of it. As I fear nothing in France, so neither do I fear anything at Rome. My fortune, my blood, and even my life, are entirely devoted to the service of the church; but I flatter nobody, and will never speak anything but the truth. I am obliged to those who have been pleased to publish my letter, for I do not at all disguise my sentiments. I thank God, they are too noble and too honourable to be disowned. However, it is not true that this letter was written to one of my ministers. As I have everywhere enemies and persons who envy me, so in all places I have friends and servants; and I have possibly as many in France, notwithstanding the court, as anywhere in the world. This is purely the truth, and you may regulate yourself accordingly. But you shall not get off so cheaply as you imagine. I will enjoin you a penance; which is, that you will henceforth take the trouble οf sending me all curious books that shall be published in Latin, French, Spanish, or Italian, on whatever subject or science, provided they are worthy of being looked into; I do not even except romances or satires; and above all, if there are any books of chemistry, I desire you may send them to me as soon as possible. Do not forget likewise tosend me your Journal. I shall order that you be paid for whatever you lay out; do but send me an account of it. This will be the most agreeable and most important service that can be done me. May God prosper you.”\n",
      "On receiving this letter, which was signed “Christina Alexandra,” it now only remained that Mr Bayle should acquaint the public with the mistake he had made, in order to merit that princess’s entire approbation; and this he did in the beginning of his Journal for January 1687.\n",
      "The persecution which the Protestants at this time suffered in France affected Mr Bayle extremely. He made occasionally some reflections on their sufferings in his Journal; and he wrote a pamphlet also on the subiect. Some time afterwards he published his Commentaire Philosophique upon these words, “Compel them to come in.” The great application he bestowed on this and other works threw him into a fit of sickness, which obliged him to discontinue his Literary Journal. Being advised to try a change of air, he left Rotterdam on the 8th of August, and went to Cleves; whence, after a time, he removed to Aix-la-Chapelle, and thereafter returned to Rotterdam on the 18th of October. In the year 1690, the famous book entitled Avis aux Réfugiez, &c. made its appearance. Mr Jurieu, who took Mr Bayle for the author of it, wrote a piece against it; and he prefixed an advice to the public, in which he calls Mr Bayle a profane person, and a traitor engaged in a conspiracy against the state. As soon as Mr Bayle had read this libel against him, he went to Rotterdam, and offered to go to prison, provided his accuser would accompany him, and undergo the punishment he deserved if the accusation were found unjust. He published also an answer to Mr Jurieu’s charge; and as his reputation, nay his very life, was at stake in case the accusation of treason were proved, he therefore thought himself not obliged to keep any terms with his accuser, and attacked him with the utmost severity. Mr Jurieu lost all patience, and applied to the magistrates of Amsterdam, who advised him to a reconciliation with Mr Bayle, enjoining them not to publish any thing against each other till it was examined by Mr Boyer, the pensioner of Rotterdam. But notwithstanding this prohibition, Mr Jurieu again attacked Mr Bayle with so much passion, that he forced the latter to write a new vindication of himself.\n",
      "In November 1690 Μ. de Beauval advertised in his Journal A Scheme for a Critical Dictionary. This was the magnum opus of Bayle. The articles of the first three letters of the alphabet were already prepared; but a dispute which happened between him and Μ. de Beauval obliged him for some time to lay aside the work. Nor did he resume it till the month of May 1692, when he published his scheme; but the public not approving of his plan, he threw it into a different form, and the first volume was published in August 1695, and the second in October following. The work in its new shape was extremely well received by the public; but it engaged him in fresh disputes, particularly with Mr Jurieu and the abbé Renaudot. Mr Jurieu published a piece, in which he endeavoured to engage the ecclesiastical assemblies to condemn the Dictionary, and presented it for that purpose to the synod sitting at Delft; but they took no notice of the affair. The consistory of Rotterdam granted Mr Bayle a hearing; and after having considered his answers to their remarks on his Dictionary, they declared themselves satisfied, and advised him to communicate this to the public. Mr Jurieu made another attempt with the consistory in 1698, and so far prevailed with them, that they exhorted Mr Bayle to be more cautious with regard to his principles in the second edition of his Dictionary, which was published in 1702, with many additions and improvements.\n",
      "Bayle was a most laborious and indefatigable writer. In one of his letters to Maizeaux, he says that since his twentieth year he hardly remembers to have had any leisure. His intense application contributed perhaps to impair his constitution, for it soon began to decline. He suffered from an affection of the lungs, which weakened him considerably; and as this was a distemper which had cut off several of his family, he judged it mortal, and would take no remedies. \n",

      "a tribe of Indians, inhabiting different parts of the peninsula of Hindostan. The appearance and manners of mankind are so much diversified in the various countries where they dwell, that animated controversies have been excited, whether all have had a common origin; or whether they have sprung from protoplasts whose conformation, at the beginning of the world, was dissimilar. Some maintain, that, in consequence of the changes produced by situation, climate, and circumstances, the present generations may possibly exhibit figures and proportions altogether different from those that distinguished their ancestors thousands of years ago; while others hold that no such differences could appear, unless they had actually formed part of the original conformation of a race. The partisans of either theory have appealed to that uniformity of features and customs known to be continued among tribes, who preserve their own descent pure and unmixed with others, of which the Jews constitute a striking example; and a case something similar, though not equally prominent, is that of the Bazeegurs. This class of people is recognised by several appellations, as Bazeegurs, Panchperee, Kunjura, or Nuts; they follow a mode of life distinguishing them from the Hindoos, among whom they dwell; they also abstain from intermixing their families with the Hindoos, and from any intereourse by which they can be united. The name Bazeegur is said to signify a juggler; and some etymologists find a probable derivation of conjuror from Kunjura, which might certainly find a corroboration from the similarity of professions. In India they are dispersed throughout the whole country, partly in wandering tribes, partly adhering to fixed residenees, but the greater proportion lead a nomadic life. '\n",
      "The Bazecgurs are divided into seven castes, Charee, Athbhyeea, Bynsa, Purbuttee, Kalkoor, Dorkinee, and Gurgwar; but all these are the same people, intermarrying as such, and avoiding alliances with other tribes. According to their own traditions, they are descended from four brothers, who, finding it difficult to provide for their numerous followers, resolved to separate, and to direct their course respectively to each quarter of the world. In cotise-1 quence of this one of them, named Sa, arrived in Bengal from Gazecpour or Allahabad. He took up his abode at Hoogly, and having governed his tribe peaceably during many years, died at Uncourpoor, whither his posterity still repair to offer up their prayers to his manes. Sa left three sons who succeeded each other; and the succession having afterwards regularly passed through several generations, at length devolved to Munbhungee, many years ago. At the same time some of the castes considered a woman called Toota as the chief of the whole; but the power ascribed to the chief seems merely nominal, scarcely amounting to restraint, and not at all to coercion. Munbhungee only resisted the entrance of any of the people acknowledging the superiority of Toota, to seek a livelihood in the territory occupied by his own sect; and the latter were under the same prohibition with respect to the places frequented by hcr and her dependents. Besides those who are united into sets or castes, there are individuals who wander about endeavouring to pick up a precarious livelihood.\n",
      "It is not evident, although the Bazeegurs are certainly distinguished by their manners and customs from the natives of Hindostan, that thcir features discriminate them as a separate race. Some of their women are reputed very beautiful, and arc thence sought after in those temporary alliances common in the East. The manners of the Panchperec are somewhat different from those of the Bazeegurs, and some of the sects are more civilized than others. It has already been observed that they are not in the exclusive occupation of any district in particular, but their villages or respective quarters are found in the same places as those of the Hindoos or British settlers. The Panchperec form neat little encampments in the upper provinces; their huts are small and regular, and each is surrounded by a small inclosure or court-yard, generally disposed in such a manner that the whole hamlet, formed of portable matting, obtains a kind of circumvallation by means of them.\n",
      "The Bazeegurs, more especially distinguished by that name, are the most civilized of the whole; they are Mahommcdans in food, apparel, and religion. The Panch-pcree profess no system of faith in preference, adopting that of any village indifferently, whither their wanderings may guide them. Some traverse the country as Mahommedan Fakeers, and live on the ill-directed bounty of devotees; and a particular association among them, of bad repute or abject superstition, has been accused of sacrificing human victims. Notwithstanding their ignorance of the established religions, they seem to venerate a female deity, Kali, probably the sanguinary goddess of the Hindoos, and many perhaps in this way seek to purchase her protection. The Bazcegurs arc circumcised, and have priests to officiate at their marriages and funerals; but their knowledge of the prophet Mahomet is very imperfect, for they can give little account of him, except that he was a saint. They secm to acknowledge an omnipotent Being, and conceive that all nature is animated by one universal spirit, which the soul, as being part of it, will rejoin after death. At the birth of their children, some Brahmin, supposed an adept in astrology, is called in to aid them in choosing a propitious name.\n",
      "Among the Panchperee, the marriage ceremony is commenced by the bridegroom repairing to the hut of his elect, and calling aloud for her to be delivered to him. A near relation, guarding the door, resists his entrance, and rudely pushes him away, while he is the object of taunts and jocularity; but when his patience is supposed to have been sufficiently put to the test, the bride is brought out. Both receive an exhortation from the priest to p ril ^ ιs , e mutual kindness; and the bridegroom, marking the bride s face with ochre, declares her his wedded wife; and she, on her part, does the same in return. The little fingers of their hands are now joined, and a scene of merriment, from which the bride alone is exempted, commences. But this consists chiefly in the progress to intoxication, for all these people are addicted to the most immoderate use of spirits; and after copious libations, a cavalcade, formed of the two parties, whose little fingers are again joined, and their parents and friends, departs for the hut of the bridegroom. Before the door there are some enigmatical ceremonies performed; the mother of the bridegroom advances with a sieve containing rice, paint, and grass, with which the foreheads of the couple are touched, after being waved around them; and the bride is led into the house, before which there stands a small fresh branch of the mango tree in an earthen pot of water. The meaning of these ceremonies is not well understood; and it is to be observed, that the origin of most of the customs of the modern races of mankind is lost in the darkness of antiquity. Some of the peasantry in Britain have various ceremonies both at marriages and funerals, such as breaking a cake above the head of the bride, or strewing flowers on the bier of one deceased, which have descended from remote ages, and arose from sources at this day unknown. When these ceremonies are completed among the Bazeegurs, a new scene of mirth is resumed; and towards evening, for the whole day from the breaking of dawn is thus occupied, the bride is conducted to her own hut, when those who are able retire; but the majority, and in general the bridegroom among them, pass the night in a state of insensibility on the neighbouring plain.\n",
      "From the earliest period they are accustomed to intoxicating draughts; even infants of five or six months old are supplied with spirits, though their mothers suckle them during five or six years; and it is not uncommon to observe several children of different ages hanging on their mother, and struggling to extract their scanty portion of nourishment, which is gradually diminished by her own insatiable propensities to the same beverage. Many of the sects are very indiscriminate in food; scarcely any thing is rejected; dead horses, jackals, and bullocks, are alike acceptable; and it has been suspected that they can even enjoy a repast of human flesh. However, this fact is not authenticated, and if analogical reasoning may be admitted here, we should be inclined to deny it, because there is no proof that any tribe, however savage, is addicted to anthropophagy, if dwelling among a more civilized people.\n",
      "The chief occupation of the Bazeegurs seems to consist in feats of address and agility to amuse the public, in which both males and females are equally skilful. The former are extremely athletic, and the women are taught dancing, which, instead of the graceful motions seen in the north, consists there principally in a display of lascivious gestures. Most, if not all, the men are jugglers, tumblers, and actors, in which they are very adroit. The people of each sect, or dramatis personae, are hired out by a sirdar or manager of a company, for a definite period, generally one year, after which they are at liberty to join an y other party. But no person can establish a set of actors without permission from the Nardar Boutah, a chief θι the Bazeegurs, who receives a proportion of the profits, and a tribute or tax from each female, somewhat analogous to what was called milk-money, a revenue levied by Ce Holy See from licenses to prostitutes. On the return θ a party from an excursion, this money is paid to the árdar Boutah, who convenes his people, and they connue feasting until the whole is expended. Should any 0 γ 1 . e managers be suspected of giving an unfair account 0 his profits, a court is assembled, where the accused must undergo the ordeal of applying his ton\n",

      "Various have been the ceremonies and customs of nations in regard to the beard. The Tartars, from a religious principle, waged a long and bloody war with the Persians, declaring them infidels, merely because they would not cut their whiskers after the fashion of Tartary; and we find that a considerable branch of the religion of the ancients consisted in the management of their beards. The Greeks wore their beards till the time of Alexander the Great; but that prince ordered the Macedonians to be shaved, lest the beard should afford a handle to their enemies. According to Pliny, the Romans did not begin to shave till the year of Rome 404, when P. Ticinius brought over a colony of barbers from Sicily. Persons of quality had their children shaved for the first time by a person of the same or greater quality, who, by this means, became godfather or adoptive father of the children.\n",
      "As to ecclesiastics, the discipline has varied touching the article of beards; sometimes they have been enjoined to wear them, from a notion of there being too much effeminacy in shaving, and that a long beard was more suitable to the ecclesiastical gravity; and sometimes again they have been forbidden to do so, from an idea that pride lurked beneath a venerable beard. The Greek and Roman churches have been long together by the ears about their beards. Since the time of their separation, the Romanists seem to have given more into the practice of shaving, by way of opposition to the Greeks; and have even made some express constitutions de radendis barbis. The Greeks, on the contrary, espouse very zealously the cause of long beards, and are extremely scandalized at the beardless images of saints in the Roman churches. By the statutes of some monasteries, it appears that the lay-monks were to let their beards grow, and the priests among them to shave; and that the beards of all who were received into the monasteries were blessed with a great deal of ceremony. There are still extant the prayers used in the solemnity of consecrating the beard to God, when an ecclesiastic was shaven.\n",
      "Le Comte observes that the Chinese affect long beards extravagantly; but nature has balked them, by only giving them a scanty growth, which, however, they cultivate with infinite care. Chrysostom observes that the kings of Persia had their beards woven or matted together with gold thread; and some of the first kings of France had their beards knotted and buttoned with gold.\n",
      "Among the Turks, it is more infamous for any one to have his beard cut off, than among us to be publicly whipt or branded with a hot iron. The Arabs make the preservation of their beards a capital point of religion, because Mahommed never cut his. Hence the razor is never drawn over the grand signior's face; and the Persians, who clip their beards and shave above the jaw, are reputed downright heretics. The slaves who serve in the seraglio have their beards shaven as a sign of their servitude.\n",
      "The most celebrated ancient writers, and several modern ones, have spoken honourably of the fine beards of antiquity. Homer commemorates the white beard of Nestor, and that of old King Priam. Virgil describes that of Mezentius, which was so thick and long as to cover all his breast; and Chrysippus praises the noble beard of Timotheus, a famous player on the flute. Pliny the younger tells us of the white beard of Euphrates, a Syrian philosopher; and he takes pleasure in relating the respect mixed with fear which it inspired the people withal. Plutarch speaks of the long white beard of an old Laconian, who, being asked why he let it grow to such length, replied, “It is that, seeing continually my white beard, I may do nothing unworthy of its whiteness.” Strabo relates that the Indian philosophers called gymnosophists were particularly attentive to have their beards of sufficient length to “captivate” the veneration of the people ;—Diodorus gives a very circumstantial history of the beards of the Indians ;—Juvenal does not forget that of Antilochus the son of Nestor ;— Fenelon, in describing a priest of Apollo in all his magnificence, tells us that he had a white beard down to his girdle -and Persius, convinced that a beard was the symbol of wisdom, thought he could not bestow a greater encomium on Socrates, than by calling him the bearded master, Magistrum barbatum.\n",
      "Whilst the Gauls were under the sway of their native sovereigns, none but the nobles and Christian priests were permitted to wear long beards. But the Franks having made themselves masters of Gaul, assumed the same au thority as the Romans; the bond-men were expre ss i v commanded to shave their chins; and this law continued in force until the entire abolishment of servitude in France So, likewise, in the time of the first race of kings, a lon<i∙ beard was the sign of nobility and freedom; and the kings as being the highest nobles in their kingdom,were emulous likewise to have the largest beards. Eginard, secretary to Charlemagne, speaking of the last kings of the first race says they came to the assemblies in the field of Mars in a carriage drawn by oxen, and sat on the throne with their hair dishevelled, and a very long beard, crine profuso, bαrhα submissa, solio residerent, et speciem dominantis effingerent.\n",
      "To touch any one’s beard, or cut off a bit of it, was among the first French, the most sacred pledgeof protection and confidence. For a long time all letters that came from the sovereign had, for greater sanction, three hairs of his beard in the seal; and there is still in being a charter of 1121, which concludes with the following words: Quod, ut ratum et stabile perseveret in posterum, praesenti scripto sigilli mei robur apposui cum tribus pilis barbae mere.\n",
      "Several great men received or adopted the surname of Bearded. The emperor Constantine is distinguished by the epithet of Pogoniαtes;— in the time of the Crusades, we find there was a Geoffrey the Bearded ;— Baldwin IV. earl of Flanders, was surnamed Handsome Beard;— and, in the illustrious house of Montmorenci, there was a famous Bouchard, who took a pride in the surname of Bearded, and was always the declared enemy of the monks, without doubt because of their being shavelings.\n",
      "In the tenth century, we find that King Robert of France, the rival of Charles the Simple, was not more famous for his exploits than for his long white beard, ln order that it might be more conspicuous-to the soldiers when he was in the field, he used to let it hang down outside his cuirass; and this venerable sight encouraged the troops in battle, nay served to rally them when defeated. A celebrated painter in Germany, called John Mayo, had so large a beard that he was nicknamed John the Bearded. In fact it was so long that he wore it fastened to his girdle; and though he was a very tall man, it hung upon the ground when he stood upright. John took the greatest care of this extraordinary beard, which he would sometimes untie in the presence of the emperor Charles V., who took great pleasure in seeing the'wind make it fly against the faces of the lords of his court. In England, the chancellor Sir Thomas More, one of the greatest men of his time, being on the point of falling a victim to court intrigues, was able, when on the fatal scaffold, to procure respect for his beard, and saved it, by a pleasantry, from the fatal stroke which he could not escape himself. When he had laid his head on the block, he perceived that his beard was likely to be hurt by the axe of the executioner; on which he took it away, observing, “My beard has not been guilty of treason; it would be an injustice to punish it.’\n",
      "Every one has admired on medallions and in portraits the beard of the renowned Henry IV. of France, which gave to the countenance of that prince a majestic dignity and openness, and which ought to serve as a model for that of every great king, as the beard of his illustrious minister should for that of every statesman. But~there is little dependence on the stability of the things of this world. By an event equally fatal and unforeseen, the beard, which had arrived at its highest degree of glory, a H 0 f a sudden lost its favour, and was at length entirely proscribed. The unexpected death of Henry the Great, and the youth of his successor, were the sole causes of this revolution.\n",
      "Louis XIII. mounted the throne of his glorious ancestors without a beard. Every one concluded immediately that the courtiers, seeing their young king with a smooth chin, would look upon their own as too rough; and the conjecture proved correct. They presently reduced their beards to whiskers, and a small tuft of hair under the nether lip. But the people at first refused to follow this dangerous example. The duke of Sully also persisted in clinging to his beard. This man, great as a general and a minister, was likewise so in his retirement, and had the courage to keep his long beard, nay, to appear with it at the court of Louis XIΠ., when called thither to give his advice in an affair of importance. The young smooth-shaven courtiers laughed outright at the grave look and old-fashioned appearance of the venerable minister; on which the latter, probably jealous of the honour of his beard, observed to the king, “Sir, when your father, of glorious memory, did me the honour to consult me on his great and important affairs, the first thing he did was to send away all the buffoons and stage-dancers of his court.”\n",
      "The czar Peter, who had so many claims to the surname of Great, seems to have been but little worthy of it in the matter of beards. He had the boldness to impose a tax on the produce of his subjects’ chins.

      "de, appears to have been one of those persons who, from restlessness of disposition and singularity of character, obtain, in their own age, more celebrity than they are entitled to from their merit or talents. He was born at Paris in 1732, and was the son of a clockmaker, who brought him up to his own trade. From his earliest youth, however, he discovered an inclination for literature, together with a remarkable talent for music. FIis proficiency in this art procured him an introduction to the French court, where he was employed to teach the princesses, daughters of Louis XV., to play on the guitar. At their concerts, which he attended, he became acquainted with the banker Duverney, by whom he was instructed in business, and placed in a situation which was likely to lead to fortune. Beaumarchais first attracted public attention by his drama of Eugenie, which was published in 17β7; but he was chiefly indebted for the notoriety he obtained to the various law-suits in which he became involved after the death of his patron Duverney. Having commenced an action against the Count de la Blache, the grand-nephew of Duverney, for payment of a trifling balance of an account which was due to him by his deceased patron, and the suit having been removed from Aix to Paris, Μ. Goezman, one of the judges of the parliament of Maupéou, which was then very unpopular in the capital, was appointed to report and decide on its merits. Beaumarchais, susρect-ing that he was excluded from the presence of Goezman by the influence of the Count de la Blache, and thus prevented from explaining the merits of his case, bribed certain dependents of the judge in order to be admitted to an interview. The cause, however, was decided against him before he could obtain an audience; and the whole of the bribe not having been returned, a long correspondence took place, by which Goezman was at length so much exasperated, that he instituted a prosecution against Beaumarchais for an attempt to corrupt him in his judicial capacity. Beaumarchais was acquitted of the charge, while Goezman was found liable to him in damages, and was further convicted of subornation and falsehood in his attempts to substantiate the accusation. But the decision against Goezman having been rescinded, and the principal cause remitted to the parliament of Aix, where it had originally depended, Beaumarchais became again involved with the Count de la Blache in a litigation which originated in the calumnies and undue influence by which the count attempted to overpower his adversary. In this dispute, however, Beaumarchais also prevailed; but the chief advantage which he acquired from these various processes was the astonishing interest and admiration which were universally excited in France by the Pactums or Mémoires which he wrote in his defence; in which the most logical and convincing argument is diversified with the bitterest sarcasm, the keenest raillery, and the relation of incidents as strange and amusing as any which are met with in romance. These able and lively productions, however, procured him many enemies, as they discovered him to be a man of a most resentful and calumnious disposition. He also lost a good deal of the reputation he had acquired, from being involved in a new process, in which he found the advocate Bergasse a more formidable opponent than Goezman or La Blache; and his new Mémoires wanted the spirit and gaiety to which his former ones were indebted for their popularity. Though occupied with these processes and various literary pursuits, Beaumarchais did not neglect the improvement of his fortune. He engaged in various speculations, of which the most profitable was his project of supplying the Americans with arms and ammunition during the war with this country. Having thus gained a considerable fortune, he built a magnificent villa in the Faubourg St Antoine, which he embellished with much taste and at great expense. He afterwards lost some part of the money he had acquired by an expensive and ill-executed edition of the works of Voltaire; and neither the early support which he gave to the principles of the French revolution, nor his importation of fire-arms for the use of the French forces, was sufficient to preserve his property from confiscation, or his person from proscription. The sufferings and dangers which he experienced during this period have been detailed by him m a work entitled Mes Six Epoqzιes, which is written with considerable force and interest. After he had endured every species of accusation and persecution, and had passed some time as an exile from his native country, he returned to France when the storms of the revolution had subsided into a more settled tyranny; and having recovered possession of his villa in the Faubourg St Antoine, he remained there till his death, which happened suddenly i n the year 1799.\n",
      "The moral character of Beaumarchais seems to have been far from unexceptionable. He was remarkable for extraordinary indiscretion, restlessness, and ambition, an overweening conceit of his own talents, and an undisguised contempt for others. With these defects, it is not won-erful that his conduct should have formed the subject of some absurd calumnies. Laharpe mentions that these w θre propagated to such an extent, that it was at one time reported that he had made away by poison with his two wives, whom he had successively married for their fortunes; a report on which Voltaire is said to have remarked, “Ce Beaumarchais n'est point un empoisonneur, il est trop drole” Even the journey which he undertook to Spain in order to vindicate the honour and secure the happiness of a sister, and which seems to have been the most praiseworthy action of his life, was made the subject of invidious misrepresentations, from which he has vindicated himself in one of his Mémoires against La Blache and Goezman.\n",
      "Bėsides his Mémoires, Beaumarchais is the author of various dramatic productions, which made a great noise, and gained him considerable reputation in Paris at the time they appeared. His Eugenie, of which the plot is founded on a story in the Diable Boiteux, and his Deux Amis, which hinges on the embarrassment and perplexity of a merchant on the verge of insolvency, are serious sentimental comedies, written in imitation of Diderot’s Pere de Famille. Eugenie, which was the most successful of the two, is rather a romance carried on by dialogue than a drama. It possesses little pathos or interest, and the only emotion felt in its perusal is a certain degree of curiosity concerning the event of the story. The incidents in Les Deux Amis are flat and insipid; and as it is not sustained by the charms of versification, it fails almost entirely in stage effect. Beaumarchais obtained more success in his dramatic career when he quitted the imitation of Diderot, and, following the natural gaiety of his own genius, represented the lively and entertaining character of Figaro in two successive pieces, Le Barbier de Seville, and La Folle Journée, ou le Mariage de Figaro. The first of these comedies merely turns on the assistance which the Count Almaviva receives from Figaro, the Barbier de Seville, in his stratagem to carry off Rosine by duping an old guardian, by whom she was strictly watched, and who intended to marry her himself. The Mariage de Figaro principally hinges on the scheme devised by the Count Almaviva for marrying a beautiful attendant of his countess to Figaro, with designs which seem to have been suggested by some scenes in the Casina of Plautus. Both pieces are full of lively dialogue, dramatic movement, and ingenious jeux de theatre. The author, however, had at first great difficulty in getting the Mariage de Figaro represented; and the curiosity and expectation of the public were excited to the highest pitch previously to its appearance. It continued to be acted twice a week for two years, and produced immense profits both to the author and the comedians. To a reader of the present day, the chief interest of the Mariage de Figaro arises from the distress experienced by the countess on finding herself forsaken by her husband, and the engaging though not very moral character of the page Cherubin; but in France its popularity might be partly owing to the numerous sarcasms both on the political and judicial administration of the country. This was evidently one of the author’s chief objects, as he boasts in his preface, quil a forme son plan de façon a y faire entrer la critique June foule d'abus qui désolent la société. Beaumarchais has introduced Figaro a third time, in his last drama, La Mere Coupable; and it is generally supposed that by this character, in all the three dramas, he intended to represent himself. Figaro, it is true, is originally a barber, and afterwards a valet; but he is also a poet, a musician, and a great intriguer, whilst the freedom which he uses with his master gives full scope for the development of the character. In La Mere Coupable, he has also introduced, under the name of Begearss, his old opponent the advocate Bergasse. Indeed he says in his preface, Ah! je vous jure que je l'ai vu agir; je n aurais pas pu [inventer.\n",

      "Most of the plays of Beaumarchais are preceded by prefaces, in which he has vindicated them against objections, and pointed out their beauties; but, as he was not possessed of much learning or taste, his literary pleadings were not so happy as his judicial ones. Indeed the great secret of Beaumarchais’s success was the perceiving and availing himself of the tone and spirit of the times. The vogue in which the Père de Famille then was, secured applause for his Comedies Larmoyantes. The unpopularity of a parliament intrusted with the administration of justice procured a favourable reception for his Mémoires; and the rising clamour against the government of the country gave additional zest to the sarcasms of ∖X∖eMarmge de Figaro.

He became a professor of experimental physics, first at Palermo, and then at Rome, and was appointed to the same situation at lurιn in 1748: he was afterwards made tutor to the young princes de Chablais and de Carignan, and continued t< reside principally at Turin during the remainder of his life In May 1755 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, to which he afterwards communicated severa papers relating to his favourite pursuits.

      "1. The most voluminous and most important of his ' works, entitled Delι Elettrismo Artificiale e Naturali, appeared at Turin, 1753, 4to, and was reprinted in 1772. It was translated into English, and published, with the original engravings, under the title of A Treatise upon Aτ-tificiαl Electricity, and an Essay on the Mild and Slow Electricity of the Atmosphere.

      "The accurate and elaborate experiments related in these works obtained for their author the warm and repeated encomiums of the scientific historian Dr Priestley, and the approbation and friendship of other contemporary philosophers; although it must be confessed that, amidst the multitude of important facts recorded in them, we sometimes observe a want of clearness of arrangement and closeness of reasoning; nor must we attempt to claim for Beccaria either the originality of a Franklin, the mathematical precision of an AEpinus, the enlarged views of a Cavendish, or the neatness and inventive talent of a Volta. The most remarkable novelties which deserve to be distinguished among our author’s experiments and opinions relate to the limited conducting power of water, to the electrification of the air and smoke, to the velocity of electricity, to the reduction of metals by its powers, to the illumination of the solar phosphori by the spşrk, to the light excited by the motion of thê air, and to a variety of meteorological phenomena, especially lightning, storms, rain, water-spouts, ' and atmospherical magnetism. The resistance exhibited by water to the passage of the electric fluid is demonstrated by the luminous appearance of its path, while it passes through more perfect conductors without producing light, as well as by the explosion of glass tubes containing water, through which the spark is taken; and this experiment is extended to the construction of an electrical water-gun, which is said to have carried a small bullet with considerable force.\n",
      "Father Beccaria observed, about the same time with Mr Canton, that the air surrounding an electrified body was capable of becoming electric by slow degrees, and that it also parted slowly with its electricity; and, by means of some property of this kind, he produced the appearance of a luminous atmosphere about an electrified ball, to which another was presented, in a partial vacuum. 1he smoke of colophony, surrounding an electrified body, enabled it to give longer sparks; but this smoke was little attracted by the body when the heated spoon containing the colophony was insulated. Respecting the velocity of electricity, he relates some experiments, which amply deserve to be confirmed or confuted. He found the effect of a spark occupy at least half a second in passing through 500 feet of wäre, and six and a half through a hempen cord of the same length, although when the cord was wetted, it passed through it in two or three seconds. It is well known, that, in the earlier experiments of Watson, a shock was transmitted through a much longer circuit of wire, without occupying any perceptible interval of time ln its passage. Many of the metals were revived from their oxyds, and mercury was reproduced from cinnabar by the powers of electricity; and our author fancied that he had discovered a common principle in the different metals, as several of them gave the same colour to the urfące of the glass to which they were attached. The brilliancy of the electric light was demonstrated by the permanency of its effect on the solar phosphori; and this su ⅛ect was afterwards pursued by various experiments of Canton and others. The light often exhibited by the air rushing into a vacuum is attributed by Beccaria to the friction of the air against the sides of the glass. It may be remarked that the phenomenon is, in all probability, of the same kind as the appearance of light observed long ago in the air-gun by its first inventor, Ctesibius of Alexandria. With respect to atmospherical electricity, Beccaria’s researches were most laborious and extensive, and he made a great variety of experiments illustrative of the nature of lightning, and of storms in general; showing, for instance, the facility with which small bodies are forced into the course of the electric current, as light clouds are made to assist in conveying a stroke of lightning; and proving that evaporation, and the deposition of vapour, are always accompanied by electrical changes. Thunderstorms, in general, he attributes to terrestrial electricity, and supposes the clouds to be merely the channels by which the fluid is carried from one part of the earth’s surface to another, the equilibrium having been first disturbed by chemical changes within the earth; and it must be confessed that this opinion is in some measure countenanced by the frequent connection which is observable between these phenomena and those of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Water-spouts, he assures us on the authority of several eye-witnesses, may certainly be dispersed by pointing swords and knives at them; and, with respect to conductors erected for safety, though he appreciates their utility very highly, he thinks that every large building should be furnished with more than one or two. The electricitas vindex, so often mentioned, is the electricity made sensible in one body by the removal of another which has been situated near it;—a property which afterwards led to the elegant inventions of the electrophorus and the condenser of Wilke and Volta. Our author appears to be somewhat disposed to exaggerate the importance of electrical changes as the causes of other atmospherical phenomena, and, in particular, to overrate the intimacy of the connection of electricity with magnetism. The appearance of the aurora borealis he attributes to the circulation of electricity through the higher regions of the atmosphere, and he was well aware of the magnetical changes which usually accompany this remarkable occurrence.\n",
      "5. His papers in the Philosophical Transactions are all in Latin. The first is entitled Experiments in Electricity, in a Letter to Dr Franhliη. {Phil. Trans. 1760, p. 514.) These experiments relate principally to the subject of electrical attractions and repulsions, which the author attempts to reduce to the effect of currents of air displaced by the immediate action of the electric fluid. He supposes the air between two bodies, in dissimilar states, to be rarefied by the interchange of their electricity, so as to produce the appearance of attraction; and when the bodies are in similar states, he imagines the air interposed to be the immediate object of their apparently mutual repulsion. The paper is accompanied by a note of Dr Franklin, explanatory of the apparatus employed.\n",
      "6. An Account of the Double Refractions in Crystals. {Phil. Trans. 1762, p. 486.) The double refraction of rock crystal had been observed by Huygens. Beccaria seems to have imagined that it was not discoverable when the surfaces concerned were parallel to each other; but later observations have shown that his observations were defective in this respect, at the same time that they have confirmed his conjecture respecting the existence of a similar property in almost all crystallized substances.\n",
      "7. Novorum quorundam in re Electrica Experimentorum Specimen. {Phil. Trans. 1766, p. 105.) In this paper our author defends the simpler theory of Franklin against Mr Symmer’s doctrine of the existence of two separate electric fluids. He also enumerates a great variety of cases of the excitement of positive or negative electricity by the friction of different substances with glass, hare-skin, a silk stocking, sealing-wax, and sulphur.\n",
      "8. A second paper, with the same title, appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1767, p. 297. It contains an account of a repetition of experiments on the modification produced in the charge of two or more glass plates, by separating them, and by removing and replacing their coatings. These investigations were principally suggested by the well-known observations of the Jesuits, made at Pekin many years before, and by some subsequent experiments of Mr Symmer. The author calls the effect an oscillation of electricity; it depends on the same causes as the “vindicating electricity,” which he has elsewhere described.\n",
      "9. De Atrnosphaera Electrica libellus. (Phil. Trans. 1770, p. 277.) The phenomena of induced electricity are here discussed, but not with great precision: the author adverts, however, to the Newtonian demonstration of the equilibrium of the force of a gravitating substance, distributed through the surface of a sphere, with respect to a particle within it, and gives somewhat clearer views of the theory of electricity than his former works had exhibited, but still falls far short of the perfection which AEpinus had attained more than ten years before.\n",

      "during nearly forty-five years professor at Göttingen, was born at Hoye, in the electorate of Hanover, in 1739. His father, who was receiver of taxes, and postmaster in that town, occupied himself in •the cultivation of a small piece of land, and appears to have inspired his son with a taste for agriculture. However, all the honour of his education belongs to his mother, who, having become a widow when young Beckmann was scarcely seven years old, sent him, in his fifteenth year, to the school at Stade, placing him under the care of Gchlcn. Being intended for the clerical function, he repaired in 1759 to Göttingen, to finish his studies there; but, whether the advice of Hollmann, who testified much kindness towards him, produced a change in his plans, or that the instructions of the mathematicians, Kaestner and Tobias Mayer, had greater attractions for him than theology, he abandoned the career on which he had entered, in order to devote himself entirely to the natural sciences, and principally to the application of these sciences to economical purposes. His first studies were not without their use to him; he derived from them a methodical habit of mind, and a considerable knowledge of languages, which, in the sequel, assisted him greatly in the pursuits to which he owed his celebrity. In 1762, having lost his mother, and with her his former means of subsistence, he accepted the offer of Busching, who invited him to come and fill the situation of Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Lutheran Academy at St Petersburg, of which this celebrated geographer had' at that time the direction; but Busching quitting the institution shortly after, and dissensions having arisen among the superintendents, Beckmann gave up his place, and made a journey through Sweden to acquire a detailed knowledge of the mines of this country, and of the manner of working them. Linnaeus having received him hospitably at Upsal, he prolonged his stay there, and availed himself of the friendship as well as the instructions of this great naturalist. In 1766, the governors of the university of Göttingen appointed him, on the recommendation of Busching, professor to this celebrated establishment, of which he became one of the principal ornaments. His mind, entirely directed to the practical uses of human knowledge, had early conceived the idea of an academical classification of the arts and different branches of economy, both political and domestic, which had hitherto been left to routine and accident. He composed, to serve him as a guide in this course of instruction, Treatises on Rural Economy, on Policy, on Finance, on Commerce, and other departments of practical knowledge; which, though since carried to a higher degree of perfection, owed to Beckmann their primary elements and their first scientific form. H⅛ Lectures, which had at the time the recommendation of novelty, were attended by the flower of the studious youth whom the most civilized nations of Europe sent to the university of Göttingen; and it may be added, that the most distinguished statesmen and public functionaries of Germany were among his auditors. He was in the habit of accompanying them himself into the workshops, to give them a knowledge of the different processes and handicrafts of which he had explained to them the theory. He never relinquished his public lectures; but his private studies took insensibly a direction altogether historical, the motives for which it will not, perhaps, be uninteresting to point out.\n",
      "It is considered at Göttingen, that a professor cannot be excused from explaining the progress of the science which he teaches, in all the civilized nations of Europeat the same time. Any one who, two years after the appearance of a work of importance in his department, published in any country of Europe whatsoever, should not have read and analyzed it in order to refute or else enrich his own observations from it, would not regard himself as a worthy successor to the chair of Haller, of Mosheim, of Gesner, and Michaelis. Beckmann, in particular, having studied at Göttingen at a time when the example of these great men dictated the law and gave the tone there, was determined to advance in a line with his age, and not to be ignorant of any of the steps which were making by the numerous and extensive sciences which furnished the foundation and the subjects of practical principles. But these steps were the steps of a giant; and whatever might be his ardour or his love of study, how could he be supposed to read and judge of all the important works which appeared from the year 1770, on chemistry theoretical and practical, on physics, natural history, and mathematics? His disappointment ended in chagrin, and excited in him a degree of anger against the new ideas, methods of reasoning, and materials, which changed the face, enlarged the limits, and facilitated the study of these sciences. His course of lectures, turning only on practical matters, suffered little from this circumstance; but feeling that his writings would be accused of remaining behind the progress of the sciences which were the subject of them, he directed the researches with which he wished to occupy the attention of the public to the history of arts and trades, and employed, in the illustration of this subject, the materials to which he had access in the Göttingen library, assisted by general information, a mind peculiarly fitted for this kind of study, and indefatigable industry. It is to these labours that we owe the Notices of Beckmann on the history of discoveries in the most common arts of life; for instance, the history of watch-making, of distillation, of almanacs, of insurance, of the lighting of streets, of the original country and migrations of the fruits and flowers in our gardens, of the common materials for dyeing, of bellows, of fire-arms, of mills, of grinding corn, of carriages, of different parts of our dress, of different household utensils, of a multitude of machines and mechanical contrivances employedin common trades; and of most of the products of industry, such as the gathering of saffron, the preparation of alum, the printing-press, of fulling-mills, of book-keeping, of the digging of turf, of gazettes and newspapers, of stamped paper, of the pearl fishery, of pavings, of chimneys, of collections of natural curiosities, of mile-stones, of pharmacy, of quarantine, of painted paper, of ruffles, of milking, of pawn-brokers, of looking-glasses and glass in general, of soap, of musical glasses, of watchmen, of ices to be eaten, of the anatomy of plants, of exchange, of pens for writing, of instruments of husbandry, of fireworks, of the working of pewter, of t∏ e procuring of amber, of indigo, of the gilding of weathercocks, of furs, of steel, of gardening, of crayons, of knives and forks, of corks, of sal-ammonic, of hops, of weaving, of lotteries, of hospitals for orphans and foundlings, of infirmaries, of lazarettoes, of fighting-cocks, of saltpetre, of gunpowder, of aquafortis, &c. &c. We should form to ourselves a very false idea of these Notices if we expected to find in them only some general account of these arts, and of the different manner of practising them used in different times and places. Beckmann traces their first germ from the most remote periods of antiquity; he follows tlιeir development through the obscurity of the middle ages, and exhibits their latest improvements amongst the civilized nations of modern Europe, with a patience and a depth of learning which can only be equalled by the sagacity and the variety of knowledge displayed in his researches. We have thought it would be interesting to the reader to see a list of the most remarkable among these notices, in the order in which they were published. They make five volumes in octavo, published at Leipsic from 1783 to 1805, and furnish the most invaluable materials to the individual, or society of men of letters, who may hereafter venture to undertake the general history of the origin and progress of the mechanical arts, which are so important a branch in that of civilization. It is almost needless to add, that the most exact references to original authorities accompany each article, and give it a new value in the eyes of those who are unwilling to take things upon trust, or maybe desirous to push still further the inquiries of the author.\n",
      "The same merits belong to his History of the earliest Voyages made in modern times; a highly interesting collection, which occupied the last years of his life, and which he left at the eighth number. Another result of the literary application and industry of Beckmann was a return to the studies of humanity, to which we are indebted for editions of the work De Mirabilibus Auscultationibus, attributed to Aristotle (1786); of the Wonderful Histories of Antigonus Carystius (1791); and of Marbo-dius’s Treatise on Stones (1799) ;—editions which required the rare union of physical knowledge and natural sagacity with philological learning. The Royal Society of Göttingen had, in the year 1772, admitted him one of its members; and, from that period to 1783, Beckmann supplied their proceedings with interesting memoirs, among which are the following: On the Reduction of Fossils to their Original Substances; On the History of Alum; On the Sap of Madder; On the Froth of the Sea, from which the Heads are formed for the Nicotian Fistulae; On the History of Sugar. ^[1. See Novi Commentarii Soc. Se. G. tom. ii—viii.; and Commentar. tom. L~v. ] But from this period he desisted all at once (rom partaking the labours of this learned body, probably boni the same motives that we have assigned above for the change in the objects of his own particular studies.

      "is a Scotish name familiarly known to those who have explored the recesses of modern literature, but with respect to the history of the individual himself very few particulars have hitherto been discovered. Whether he belonged to any family of distinction, we are not informed; nor is the gentility of his birth attested by Dempster, who supplies the only biographical notices with which we are acquainted. According to this contemporary authority, he was a professor in the university, and an advocate in the parliament of Paris. We must apparently conclude that he relinquished the functions of a professor, and betook himself to the practice of the bar. The same writer has stated that both Queen Mary and King James employed him in some diplomatic services, and that the latter nominated him master of requests.^[24. Guilielmus Bellendenus, sive Ballantinus, honestissimo bonarum artium studio Parisiis inclaruit professor in academia, patronus causarum in supremo Galliarum senatu; tum demum oratoris munere honestatus principibus suis, Iteginae Mariae, filioque Jaco- b0 ’ hqelem operam navavit, a quo posteriore magistri libellorum supplicum elogio honorifico est donatus. Ejus sunt: Princeps Ci-fθronιs, lib. i. Orator Ciceronis, lib. i. Senator Ciceronis, lib. i. In omnia Ciceronis Opera Observationes, lib. i. Vivit adhuc Lu- lffi λ e i P lu . ra molitur.” (Denipsteri Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum, p. 119. Bononiae, 1627, 4to.) ] That he bore such a title, is sufficiently ascertained from his own publications, in all of which he is described as “Magister supplicum Libellorum Augusti Regis Magnae Britanniae but there are obvious reasons for suspecting that his office, if not unconnected with emolument, was altogether unconnected with official duty; for he appears to have spent the greater part of his life in France. Λ∕α- gister Libellorum was an officer in the court of the Roman emperors,^[25. ffi\" ιs ≡onius de Verborum quoe ad Jus Civile pertinent Significatione, tom. ii. p. 769. edit. Heineccii. ] and it was his duty to receive and examine petitions addressed to the prince. A similar office was established in several modern kingdoms; and Maître des Pe-qu¢tes being an honourable title in France, Bellenden might solicit and obtain such a title from a sovereign who could not so easily bestow an ample salary. The terms employed by Dempster in describing his appointment, seem rather to indicate honour than emolument. It is supposed that he must have belonged to the Scotish establishment, for, in England, a person who bore this title was a judge of a particular court: of the court of requests, which professed to distribute justice gratuitously, the lord privy seal was chief judge, and was assisted by two judges called masters of requests, the one for the common, and the other for the civil law.^[26. bee Sir Thomas Smith’s Common-wealth of England, p. 245. edit. Lond. 1633, 12mo—“Therein, for the most part,” says Sir P πιas Ridley, “are handled poore miserable persons causes, as widows and orphans, and other distressed people, whose cases wholly ae on pieţie and conscience.” (View of the Civile and Ecclesiasticall Law, p. 276, 2d edit. Oxford, 1634, 4to∙) The court of re-io s ⅛ was , ÎHstituteđ about the ninth of Henry VIL, and was dissolved by statute, 16 Car. I. c. 10. ] In a list of the officers of state in Scotland, “William Ballenden, magist. supplie, libellorl ’ is said to have succeeded Mark Ker as master of requests in 1608, and to have been succeeded in 1624 by Sir James Galloway, afterwards Lord Dunkeld.^[27. Scot’s Staggering State of the Scots Statesmen, p. 189. Edinb. 17ð4, 12mo. ] But the date of his appointment seems to have been borrowed from that of his earliest publication; and Bellenden continued to describe himself as master of requests in the year 1625.\n",
      "If he practised at the bar in Paris, his early education must in all probability have been French; and if he was a regent or professor in one of the colleges, he may be supposed to have adhered to the popish religion. Since the massacre of St Bartholomew, which had proved fatal to Ramus and other men of learning, there probably had been no protestant professor in any college of Paris. His nephew, William Bellenden, was a catholic and a priest.\n",
      "Bellenden’s earliest publication bears the subsequent title: “Ciceronis Princeps, Rationes et Consilia bene gerendi firmandique Imperii: ex iis repetita quae ex Ciceronianis defluxere fontibus in libros xvi. de Statu Rerum Romanarum, qui nondum lucem acceperunt.” Paris. 1608, 8vo. This was followed by^[28. This work of Bellenden did not escape the notice of the learned and indefatigable Fabricius, Bibliοgraρhia, Antiquaria, p. 490. edit. Hamb, et Lips. 1716, 4to. ] “Ciceronis Consul, Senator, Senatusque Romanus: illustratus publici observatione juris, gravissimi usus disciplina, administrandi temperata ratione; notatis inclinationibus temporum in Rep. et actis rerum in Senatų: quae a Ciceroniana nondum edita profluxere memoria annorum dccx. congesta in libros xvi. de Statu Rerum Romanarum: unde jam manavit Ciceronis Princeps, dignus habitus summorum lectione principum. Editio prima. Ad inclytum serenissimumque Principem Henricum Principem Scotiae et Walliae.” Paris. 1612, 8vo. This mode of noting a first edition is somewhat pleasant;^[29. Another learned philologer had recently set him the example: “Julii Caesaris Bulengeri Juliodunensis de Theatro Ludisque Scenιcιs hbn duo. Editiο prima.\" Tricassibus, 1603, 8vo. ] nor must we overlook the important intelligence that his former publication had been thought worthy of the attention of mighty princes. Both these works partake of the nature of a cento. In the first of them, the author has collected from the writings of Cicero the various precepts and remarks which relate to the origin and principles of regal government, and with no small labour has combined the whole in a regular and systematic form. Adopting a similar plan in the other work, he has compiled a treatise on the dignity and authority of the consuls, and on the constitution of the Roman senate. Although this may seem an effort of mere diligence, it required both learning and ability to present such materials in such a shape.\n",
      "His next publication is entitled “De Statu prisci Orbis in Religione, Re politica, et Literis, liber unus. Ad serenissimum Principem Carolum Principem Scotiae et Walliae.” Paris. 1615, 8vo. This is a work of more originality, and affords a very favourable specimen of the author’s talents and erudition.^[30. Br Parr, in his famous preface to'Bellenden, p. v. mentions this work with much commendation. “Stylus est Bellendem pθ r librum, huncce, dilucidus in primis, neque exquisitus nimis. Sententiae hic illic occurrunt recondita?, quibus adhibita, tanquam obrussa, est ratio. Operis porro totius ita sunt aptae inter se colligataeque partes, nihil ut sit asperum, vel hiulcum, vel dissolutum, nihil m alienum irruent locum, nihil non positum sit suo.” ] It exhibits, in a very condensed form, a sketch of the history of philosophy and civil polity, tracing its progress among the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. Of this work very few copies appear to have been separately published; for the author speedily combined all the three tracts in a volume which bears the following title: “De Statu libri tres. I. De Statu prisci Orbis in Religione, Re politica, et Literis.\n",
      "II. Ciceronis Princeps, sive de Statu Principis et Imperii.\n",
      "III. Ciceronis Consul, Senator, Senatusque Romanus, sive de Statu Reip. et Urbis imperantis Orbi. Primus, nunc primum editus: caeteri, cum tractatu de Processu et Scriptoribus Rei Politicae, ab autore aucti et illustrati.” Paris. 1615, 8vo∙ Notwithstanding this notice on the title-page, we suspect that the second and third treatises were not actually reprinted. Each treatise has a distinct series of pages, and it was therefore easy to combine the whole. In its separate form and in this volume, Ciceronis Consul exhibits the very same list of typographical errors. Dr Parr remarks, that in all the copies which he had seen, the date seems to have been changed from m.dc.xv. to m.dc∙xvi. by the printer adding the letter ι after the impression had been finished: but in a copy belonging to the Advocates Library, the additional letter is apparently printed, not with a type, but with a pen; and in a copy belonging to the writer of this notice, the original date remains unaltered. Another minute variation may likewise be mentioned; in the latter copy, the plate in the second treatise' is not impressed on the reverse of a printed page of the dedication. In a paper written by Dr Bennet, the late bishop of Cloyne, we find the subsequent statement respecting the books De Statu. “The great work being now completed, Bellenden looked forward with a pretty well-grounded expectation for that applause which his labour and his ingenuity deserved. But his views were disappointed, by one of those events which no art of man could foresee or remedy. The vessel in which the whole impression was embarked was overtaken by a storm before she could reach the English coast, and foundered with all her cargo. A very few copies only, which the learned author either kept for his own use, or had sent as presents by private hands, seem to have been preserved from the destruction which awaited the others.”^[31. See Dr Johnstone’s Memoirs of Parr, p. 182. ] We are not aware of any early authority for such a statement; and the learned prelate, misled by an imperfect recollection, seems to have misapplied Dr Warton’s account of Bellenden’s larger work, which is likewise an account that requires confirmation. There is a manifest fallacy in supposing that almost all the impression of such a book must have been destined for England. After a long interval, the fame oí the author was greatly extended by Dr Parr’s publication of“Gulielmi Bellendem, Magistri supplicum Libellorum Augusti Regis Magnae Britanniae, &c. de Stat\n",

      "is a colony belonging to the British, situated on the banks of the river of the same name, in the province of Guiana, in South America. The latitude of the mouth of the river Berbice is 6. 20. N. and its longitude 57. 11. W. from London. The plantations are situated on each side of the river, and extend nearly 300 miles from its entrance. Previously to the year 1799 this colony was bounded on the east by the Devil’s Creek, and on the west by Abarry Creek, which separated it f ronl Demerary, its breadth being then 30 miles; but when Surinam surrendered to the British in that year, a négociation was entered into between the governors of these two colonies, by which Surinam conceded to Berbιcet∏θ tract of country between the Devil’s Creek and the r∏er Courantine, thus increasing its breadth to about CO miles. The sea-coast and the west bank of the Courantine were immediately surveyed and laid out into regular allotments· The extent of this colony was further enlarged by t British, who cleared and embanked from the sea the who e line of coast between the Dcmerary and the Courantmθ> forming upon it a carriage-road sixty feet broad, wιth∙sι feet parapets on each side for the convenience of travelling·\n",
      "Previously to this improvement the face of the country resembled that of the rest of Guiana. On the shores there was a border of low ground, between high and low-water marks, covered with mangroves. When the tide flowed, this border had several feet of water over it; and when it ebbed it presented an inaccessible mud-bank. This is now rendered dry and productive. Behind this border of mangroves, at the distance of 400 or 500 paces, commence low, level, swampy savannahs, formed by the rains, which are prolonged in the direction of the coast, with a depth more or less considerable, according to the distance of the mountains. This part of the colony was almost entirely neglected by the Dutch, who fixed their principal plantations in the more elevated and interior part of the country.\n",
      "The year is here divided into two dry and two wet seasons; light showers begin to refresh the land about the middle of April; the rain increases till the middle of June, when it falls in torrents; at the beginning of July these heavy rains begin to decrease; and in August the long dry season begins, and continues till November. December and January constitute the short rainy season, and February and March the short dry season. The land winds prevail during the two wet seasons, and are unhealthy; in the dry season the air is refreshed by regular diurnal sea-breezes. The temperature of this colony is not so great as might be expected from its latitude; the thermometer very seldom rises to 91°; during May, June, and July, it generally varies between 83° and 84°; and the lowest degree is about 75°. The weather always changes very gradually.\n",
      "There are two rivers in this colony, the Berbice and the Canje. The former runs from south to north, and discharges itself into the Atlantic Ocean. The coast on each side of it forms a bay at its entrance, which is nearly a mile in width, having a small island in the middle, called Crab Island, from the number of land-crabs on it; and the entrance itself is protected by three forts, but they are of little use, as Berbice must, from its situation, always follow the fate of Demerary. Without the entrance of the river is a bar of sand, over which at high tide there is seldom more than eighteen feet of water; but within, the water is of sufficient depth, and the river is navigable for ships of burden 200 miles from its mouth. On account of the bar, however, few vessels rendezvous here, but anchor off the port of Demerary. The river Canje is narrow, but deep, running at first nearly from south to north, but afterwards diverging to the west, till it falls into the Berbice about a mile from the sea. It is navigable for colony schooners thirty miles up. At its head are immense falls, and about forty miles below there is a creek which connects it with the Courantine. In this route, and by means of this creek, dispatches are brought from Surinam to Berbice by the Indians. All the water on the coast of Berbice is brackish. The rain-water, which lodges in the low parts of the forests, called bush-water, is collected by the Indians for the purposes of drinking and cooking. The forests are extensive, and contain many very large trees. ŋ r Pinckard describes an enormous tree of the Tonquin bean, the body of which rose perpendicularly to the height θf between seventy and eighty feet before it threw out a smgle branch.\n",
      "The only towns in this colony are Old Amsterdam, and Fort Nassau or New Amsterdam. The former is said by Bolingbroke to be fifty miles up the river Berbice, but Dr Bancroft places it at 100 miles from the mouth. The inconveniences attendant on this situation of Old Amsterdam were so numerous and obvious, arising chiefly from the uncertain and intricate navigation of the river, that, in the year 1766, when Dr Bancroft visited Guiana, it was resolved to remove the seat of government to a point of land on the eastern shore of the Berbice, about a mile from its entrance, formed between that river and the Canje. So slow, however, were the Dutch in their operations, that New Amsterdam, for so this town was called, was scarcely begun in the year 1796, when Berbice capitulated to the English. Under the greater activity of the conquerors, New Amsterdam soon assumed the size and appearance of the capital of the colony. It is situated on the south side of the Canje; and the houses extend up the banks of the Berbicc about a mile and a half, facing the water. The Dutch, in laying out the town, paid particular attention to health and convenience. Round each allotment there are trenches, which fill and empty themselves every tide, so that all the filth is carried off before it stagnates and becomes unwholesome. Each lot contains a quarter of an acre of land; and a free circulation of air, as well as ground for a kitchen-garden, is thus secured to the inhabitants. The houses are very long and narrow, and not more than a storey and a half high, with galleries on each side to protect them from the sun. Those inhabited by the Dutch are thatched with troolie^[1. The troolies are perhaps the largest leaves that have been hitherto discovered in any part of the world. Each leaf is supported y a single stem, which arises immediately from the root, and becomes the middle rib to the leaf, these stems are hard and strong, and about three inches in circumference near the root. Each leaf is from twenty to thirty feet in length, and from two to three feet ιn breadth. They will effectually exclude the most violent rains, and last for many years. ] and plantain leaves, which they prefer to shingles on account of coolness; but the English shingle their houses, from their dislike of the insects and vermin which the troolie and plantain leaves harbour. The government-house and colonial offices are built of brick, in the European style, and with considerable pretensions to architectural taste and magnificence.\n",
      "Before Berbice surrendered to the British, in 1796, almost all the plantations were at a distance from the coast, considerably up the banks of the Berbice and the Canje; but within a very short time after the colony came into our possession, the plantations were greatly extended. The west coast was first cultivated; and, in the year 1799, that to the eastward of the river Berbice, as far as the Devil’s Creek, was cleared and cultivated. This part was surveyed and cut into two parallel lines of estates, with a navigable canal between them for the convenience of watercarriage. Behind the second row of estates runs the river Canje, both the banks of which are cultivated with sugar, coffee, and plantains. The estates are distinguished as follows: those on the line facing the sea are the coast estates; the second line consists of the canal estates; and the remainder are called the Canje estates. Besides these there are valuable and extensive plantations on each side of the Berbice, stretching, as has been already mentioned, nearly 300 miles from its mouth. The principal and most valuable productions of the colony are sugar, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, cotton, and the arnotta or roucou shrub. This last was, for a considerable time after the settlement of the colony, cultivated almost exclusively by the Indians; they macerated its seed in the juice of lemons, in which the gum of the manna-tree had been dissolved, and thus obtained the celebrated Indian pigment, or crimson paint, with which they adorned their bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The roucou is now cultivated by the Dutch and English planters as a dye-stuff. Cotton thrives best on the coast estates, and it is on these therefore that it is principally cultivated. The sugar plantations are esteemed the most valuable.\n",
      "Agriculture, and all other labour in Berbice, is almost wholly performed by negroes. It is estimated that, on an average, there are about 200 slaves, calculated at the value of from L.50 to L.100 each, employed in producing annually 140,000 cwts. of coffee, and 10,000 cwts∙ of cocoa. The Indians who inhabit this part of the South American coast consist of four tribes; and from these, particularly the tribe of the Arrowaucs, the inhabitants derive some assistance, as a few of them reside on almost every plantation, and are employed in various services, particularly in hunting and fishing. They have no animals domesticated, nor any grain or roots, except the cassada, brought into cultivation. A small species of deer, which somewhat resembles the hare, and the armadillo, are their favourite food. They scald off the fur of the deer, cut the body in pieces, and stew it in cassada juice, seasoning it very highly with capsicum. The weapons they employ are the common bow and arrow, and the poisoned arrow, which they blow from a tube. Their accuracy and skill in using both these is surprising. With the common arr\n",

      "the celebrated bishop of Cloyne, was the eldest son of William Berkeley, Esq. of Thomas-town, in the county of Kilkenny, a cadet of the family of Earl Berkeley of Berkeley Castle. At eight years of age he was sent to the school of the Ormond foundation at Kilkenny, from which Swift had a few years before been removed to the university. Before Berkeley had attained his fourteenth year he was admitted a pensioner in Trinity College, Dublin, in which, whilst bachelor of arts, he obtained a fellowship. Some of his first essays as a writer were published in the Spectator and Guardian, which entertaining works he adorned with many pieces in favour of virtue and religion. His learning and his virtues, his wit and agreeable conversation, made his friendship sought and his acquaintance cultivated by many great and learned men; and amongst others by the Earl of Peterborough, Dr Swift, Dr Arbuthnot, Mr Pope, and Mr Addison. The earl took him as chaplain and secretary of legation into Italy; and during his absence on that occasion he became senior fellow of his college, and was in 1717 created D. D. by diploma.\n",
      "Upon his return, his acquaintance among the great was considerably extended; and Lord Burlington, who at Rome had conceived a high esteem for him on account of his skill in architecture, obtained for him, through the Duke of Grafton, then (1721) lord-lieutenant of Ireland, the king’s grant of the deanery of Down, worth L.2000 per annum. Such, however, was the narrow system of politics at that time prevalent in the Irish cabinet, that though his majesty had actually signed the grant, the lords justices recommended bach for this preferment Swift’s Dean Daniel, celebrated for having in a state sermon styled Pompey an unfortunate gentleman ;” and such was Dr Berkeley s humility and mildness of temper, that he could not be prevailed upon to dispute the matter, or even to expostulate on. the subject. His patron Lord Burlington procured for him afterwards (1724) the deanery of Derry, the next best in Ireland to that of Down; and upon this preferment the doctor resigned his fellowship.\n",
      "In the year 1722 his fortune received a considerable increase from an event by him very unexpected. Upon his first going to London (1717), he sent one morning a note to Swift, desiring that they might dine together that day at a tavern. The dean of St Patrick’s returned for answer, that they might enjoy each other’s company at their ease where he was himself engaged to dine, with the family of Mrs Esther Vanhomrigh, the celebrated Vanessa\"· and thither accordingly he took Mr Berkeley. Some years before her death this lady removed to Ireland, and fixed her residence at Cell-bridge, a pleasant village in the neighbourhood of Dublin, most probably with the view of frequently enjoying the company of a man for whom she had conceived a very singular attachment. But finding herself totally disappointed in that expectation, she altered her intention of making the dean of St Patrick’s her heir, and left the whole of her fortune, about L.8000, to be divided equally between her near relation Judge Marshal of the Common Pleas in Ireland, and Dr Berkeley, whom she had never seen but once in her life, and that at the distance of nine years.\n",
      "In the interval between Dr Berkeley’s return from abroad and his preferment to the deanery of Derry, his mind had been employed in conceiving a noble and benevolent plan for the better supplying of the churches in our foreign plantations, and for converting the savage Americans to Christianity, by erecting a college in the Bermudas. To this proposal the address and abilities of its author procured, after a tedious attendance on the great, an apparently successful reception; for he obtained a charter for its foundation, together with a parliamentary grant of L.20,000 for carrying it into execution, to which were added several large subscriptions from individuals, to be paid as soon as the public bounty should be received. Upon the faith of this our philosopher embarked for America; where he became so generally and so justly venerated by all descriptions of men, that they vied with one another who should most honour him. The queen, with whom he was a favourite, had endeavoured to dissuade him from this enterprise, by offering him her interest for an English bishopric; but he replied, that he should prefer the headship of St Paul’s College at Bermudas to the primacy of all England. From that headship he was to enjoy a revenue of L.100 per annum, and was bound by his charter to resign his deanery, then worth L.1100 per annum, within a year and a half after the L.20,000 should be paid by government. But that sum was never paid; and after two years’ residence on Rhode Island and its neighbouring continent, during which time every interest of piety and virtue was near his heart and cultivated by his labours, the dean was obliged to return to Europe, and abandon one of the noblest designs that had ever entered into the human heart to form.\n",
      "In August 1728, immediately before his departure for America, he entered into marriage with Anne, the eldest daughter of the Right Honourable John Forster, speaker of the Irish house of commons; this lady died in 1785. In May 1734 he was consecrated bishop of Cloyne, and vacated his deanery. On that occasion he said to his few intimates, “I will never accept of a translation.” At Cloyne he distinguished himself by pastoral vigilance, prelatical hospitality, and constant residence. Throughout the whole of his clerical life he was, while his health permitted, a constant and an extemporaneous preacher; nor is it known that he ever reduced a single sermon to writing, except one preached before the society for propagating the gospeI in foreign parts, which at their request was published. He endeared himself to the people of his diocese by promoting at once their temporal and their spiritual happiness. He endeavoured by all means to raise a spirit of industry, and to encourage the improvement of agriculture in that neglected country; and it may be truly said, that never man laboured more earnestly to amass a fortune or to aggrandize a family, than he did to promote the best interests of mankind, considered either as citizens of earth or as candidates for heaven.\n",
      "The earl of Chesterfield, who had never seen him but once, and that when they were both young men, on being made lord-lieutenant of Ireland, sent to him a most respectful offer of the then vacant see of Clogher, which was more than double the value of that of Cloyne; promising at the same time his recommendation to any other richer see that might be vacated during his administration. But the good bishop declined the generous offer, requesting the lordlieutenant not to think of him on any other vacancy, as he was resolved never to quit his first bishopric for any other. In 1751, finding the infirmities of age come upon him, and wishing to retire from the care of his diocese to superintend the education of his son, then nominated a student of Christ Church, that the revenues of the church might not be misapplied, nor the interests of religion suffer by the absence of the pastor from his flock, fie made great interest for leave to resign his bishopric, of which the income was then not less than L.1700 per annum. Failing of success in this application, he let the lands of his demesne at Cloyne on very easy terms, at the rent of L.200, which he directed to be distributed annually among the poor house-keepers of Cloyne, Youghall, and Aghadda, until his return.\n",
      "At Oxford he lived highly respected by the learned members of that great university, till the hand of Providence unexpectedly deprived them of the pleasure and advantage derived from his residence among them. On Sunday evening, the 14th January 1753, as he was sitting in the midst of his family, and just after he had concluded an extemporaneous comment on the 15th chapter of first Corinthians, he was instantly translated, without a groan, from earth to heaven. A polypus in the heart was the cause of his dissolution. About a minute before his death he had seated himself on a couch and turned his face towards the wall; and had he not ceased speaking in the middle of a sentence, his lady and his son would not immediately have discovered their loss. His remains were with much funeral solemnity interred at Christ Church, his friend Bishop Conybeare, then dean of that cathedral, performing the last service. An elegant marble monument, with a spirited inscription by the archbishop of York, marks the spot where his ashes rest. As to his person, he was of the tall middle size; his countenance was very handsome, and full of meaning and benignity; and his bodily strength was uncommonly great, even to the last year of his life; but he was subject to grievous nervous colics, in which he thought tar-water gave him more efficacious relief than any other medicine. Mr Pope sums up his character in one line. After mentioning some particular virtues which characterized other prelates then liv-mg, he ascribes “to Berkeley every virtue under heaven.” t ^1he following anecdote will serve to convey an impression both of his talents and character. Bishop Atterbury, having heard much of Mr Berkeley, wished to see him. Accordingly he was one day introduced to that prelate by the Earl of Berkeley. After some time, Mr Berkeley quitted the room; on which Lord Berkeley said to the bishop, “Does my cousin answer your lordship’s expectations?” The bishop, lifting up his hands in astonishment, r θplied, “So much understanding, so much knowledge, so much innocence, and such humility, I did not think bad been the portion of any but angels, till I saw this gentle- n 1 * an ∙ .

      "a county situated at the south-eastern extremity of Scotland, is bounded by the German Ocean on the east; by East Lothian on the north; by a part of Mid Lothian, but chiefly by Roxburghshire, on the west; by the river Tweed, and that part of Roxburghshire which lies to the north of the same river, on the south; and by the township of Berwick on the south-east. On the south, the Tweed, in a winding course of about thirty-five miles, divides it, first, from the part of Roxburghshire which lies south of the river; secondly, from Northumberland; and thirdly, from North Durham. Its northern extremity is situated in north latitude 55.58. 30., and its southern point upon the Tweed is in 55. 36. 30. Dunse, its principal town, and situated nearly in the centre of the county, is 2° 20' west of Greenwich. Its extreme length is thirty-one miles and a quarter, and its extreme breadth nineteen and a half miles. Its superficies is 446 square miles, or 285,440 acres, of which more than one half is supposed to be arable, the remainder consisting of upland pasture and unreclaimed moor.\n",
      "The county consists of two divisions, greatly distinguished from each other by their natural characters. The first is the mountainous range of the Lammermoors, extending inland from the promontory of St Ebb’s, commonly called St Abb’s, Head on the east, to the confines of the county on the west; the second is the lower country, extending from the foot of the Lammermoor Hills on the north, to the Tweed and the boundaries of the county on the south. This is termed the Merse, from its ancient name, the March or Border. The Lammermoor comprehends within it the valley of the Leader, termed Lauderdale, and generally regarded as a distinct division of the county.\n",
      "Of the elevated tract of the Lammermoors, the northern part is in East Lothian, where it is more rugged and precipitous than towards its southern slope. The whole range is bleak and unfertile. The summit-level may be held to be upwards of 1000 feet above the sea, rising at one point, Criblaw, on the north-west, to the height of 1615 feet. On the south the mountains generally sink into the lower grounds of the Merse, by an easy declivity. Here they are cultivated, and interspersed tracts of ara-fie land extend throughout the range. But, generally speaking, the tract is barren, and productive, for the most part, only of heath and the coarser herbage. Its soil and climate are unpropitious to vegetation in a greater degree than its elevation alone would lead one to expect. In this respect it differs from the hills around Cheviot on the southern side of the Tweed, which, at the same or a higher altitude, are greatly more rich and verdant. This arises from the different nature of the mountain rocks of these two chains, but may be partially produced by the difference of their aspect and exposure. In Lammeťmoor the gradual rise of the mountains, and their continuity, afford little natural shelter. In the Cheviots, the mountains; springing separately from their bases in a conical form, protect each other in every direction. The sheep pastured in this extensive district are partly the Cheviot, but chiefly the black-faced mountain sheep, common in the other highlands of Scotland.\n",
      "The Merse, the other great division of the county, rises gradually from the valley of the Tweed to the foot of these mountains. Though presenting from an eminence the appearance of an unbroken plane inclining towards the south and east, and surrounded on other sides by the high grounds, it yet possesses much diversity of surface, forming in some places considerable swells, and in others valleys through which the rivers and streamlets of the country find their way to a lower level. At some parts the elevations are considerable, as at Dunse Law, contiguous to the Lammermoor range, and at Home-Castle, situated on an elevation of trap-rock, at the western part of the plain of the Merse, 898 feet above the level of the sea. This castle, which forms a beautiful object to the surrounding country, is merely a slight modern structure, built upon the ruins of the ancient edifice, which, on the refusal of the governor to surrender, was destroyed by a detachment of the army of Oliver Cromwell. The whole of the tract, from this point eastward to the sea, as well as the low land to the westward, is admirably cultivated, subdivided by innumerable hedges, and everywhere ornamented by plantations, pleasure-grounds, and country seats, and, above all, by excellent farm-houses; presenting an appearance of industry and rural prosperity nowhere surpassed, and forming a striking contrast to the wretchedness and habits of plunder by which, till the union of the British crown, the inhabitants of this, as of all the border districts, had never ceased to be distinguished.\n",
      "The rivers of the county are, the Tweed, which skirts it for about 27 miles, and falls into the sea at Berwick; the Whitadder and the Blackadder, both taking their rise in different parts of the Lammermoor Hills, and, after uniting, falling into the Tweed; the Eye, running into the sea at Eyemouth; the Leader, which gives its name to Lauderdale; of smaller note the Dye, the Leet, and, for a short part of its course, before it enters Roxburghshire, the Eden.\n",
      "The salmon-fishery of the river Tweed is very valuable, and has been the subject of many royal grants. Within the limits of the township of Berwick, it becomes mostly the property of that corporation. The fish, which are caught in vast numbers, chiefly near the mouth, are taken to Berwick, where they are packed in ice and shipped for the London market.\n",
      "The geological state of the county, with relation to its minerals, does not present peculiar interest. Thin seams of coal have been found traversing the sandstone of the lower country; but none of a thickness to be worked has yet been discovered, except in the parish of Mordington, near the sea, where it is said seams of workable thickness exist. T ns valuable mineral is brought by a distant land-carriage fιom the mines south of the Tweed, and from the Lothιans. Limestone is found in various places, but cannot be worked with advantage, owing to the want of coal; and the immense quantity of it used for the purposes of agriculture is therefore brought by a costly land-carriage from the adjoining counties. Clay-marl, found chiefly along the banks of the Whitadder and Blackadđer, was once extensively employed as a manure; but it has for many years given place to lime. Gypsum exists in small quantities on the banks of the Whitadder. Shell-marl is found in different places, and is worked to a considerable extent in the parish of Merton. Sandstone of different kinds occurs throughout the greater part of the county. That at Dryburgh, on the Tweed, is of fine grain, and is supposed to have furnished the stone of that beautiful structure, Melrose Abbey. Slate, but not of good quality, has been found and worked near Lauder. A species of breccia, or coarse pudding-stone, occurs in some places. The outer pier of the harbour of Eyemouth is builζ without cement, of stone of this kind, taken from an adjoining promontory, and has withstood for a long period the storms of the German Ocean, without apparent waste. Copper has been found in some places. At Ordwell, on the Whitadder, attempts were made to work the ore many years ago. Other attempts have been recently made in different places, but they have been unsuccessful.\n",
      "Berwickshire has been long noted for the excellence of its agriculture. This is chiefly distinguished by the judicious combination of pasturage with tillage, usually termed the convertible husbandry, under which system a considerable portion of each farm is kept in grass, and the land is changed from tillage to pasturage in regular succession. Great attention has been paid to the breeding of stock. The short-horned breed of cattle is introduced into all the lower district, and in many cases into the higher. The sheep of the lower country are the new Leicester breed, and have been brought to great perfection by the example of many eminent breeders. Farms are generally large, a common size being from 400 to 500 acres. The farm-houses and out-buildings are generally substantial and convenient.\n",
      "The towns are few and inconsiderable. Berwick, from which the county takes its name, forms no part of it, though it is from it that the principal exports of the county take place. The chief town with respect to population is Dunse. The other towns are Eyemouth, Coldstream, Greenlaw, Lauder, and some others of no note. Eyemouth is the only shipping port. The county town, though otherwise inconsiderable, is Greenlaw.\n",
      "The valued rent of Berwickshire is L.I78,366. 8s. 6|įd. Scots; and the real rent, as assessed to the propertytax for the year ending April 1811, was, for the lands L.231,973. 2s. 7d., and for the houses L.8152. 17s. 6d. sterling. About a third part of the valued rent is held under entail. In 1795 the rental was estimated at L.l 12,000, so that it had more than doubled in sixteen years. It is universally paid in money, and the farms are held on leases for a term of years; here, as in every other part of Scotland, nineteen years being the most common period.\n",
      "The manufactures of the district are inconsiderable, the principal being that of paper. There are, indeed, bleachfields, breweries, corn-mills, and similar small establishments, but these are chiefly for the home supply. The principal export of the county is raw produce; and the imports are coal, lime, timber, iron, and other commodities for the consumption of the inhabitants. The grain is chiefly exported to the London market from Berwick. The cattle and sheep are driven partly to Edinburgh, but chiefly to Morpeth and other markets of the south. Besides the salmon-fishery before referred to, there is a seafishery, of which the principal stations are Evemouth and Coldingham.\n",

      "a substance compounded of different ingredients, which is chewed in the East in the same way as tobacco is used in other parts of the world, but to much greater extent. All individuals, without exception of age or sex, begin at an early age to accustom themselves to betel, and it gradually becomes an article of such necessity, that those acquainted with the usages of the eastern nations affirm they would more readily dispense with their ordinary quantity of food than with it. Europeans also, who have resided long in Ceylon or India, contract the same habit, and enjoy chewing of betel equally with the natives. Betel, or pawn as it is denominated in Bengal, consists of part of the fruit of the areca palm, wrapped in the leaves of a kind of pepper plant called betel, smeared with a little shell lime; and its name betel-nut is thence derived. The areca palm is a tree growing to forty or fifty feet in height, with a straight round stem six or eight inches in diameter, covered with a smooth ash-coloured bark, marked with parallel rings. All the leaves, which are only six or seven in number, spring from the top, and are six feet in length, declining downwards from a stalk of considerable length. The fruit or nut is covered with a green shell or skin, thin, brittle, and of the consistence of paper; it is of an oval shape, about the size of a small egg, and resembles a nutmeg despoiled of its husk. When ripe, it appears in clusters of a reddish colour, forming a beautiful contrast with the vivid green of its leaves, and then falls off to sow itself in the ground. The betel plant is a species of vine, bearing a leaf somewhat resembling ivy. It is called piper betel by botanists, and is of the same genus as the piper nigrum of Linnaeus. Its culture, which is carefully attended to, is managed in the same manner. Poles are planted in the earth, around which the betel twines itself, and as it runs up, the poles acquire greater height also. It is a creeping plant, seeking support from stronger vegetables, but it is said not to be destructive of them, like some other plants of a similar nature. Particular regard is paid to the cultivation of areca and betel throughout the countries of which they are natives. Several years ago it was found, on enumeration, that the number of trees, probably meaning the areca only, in Prince of Wales’s Island, amounted to 342,110. The lime used with the nut is called chunam, and is obtained from the calcination of shells, which produces the finest kind. But the fresh nut must be avoided; it then contains a white viscous matter, insipid to the taste, and occasioning delirium, like ebriety from wine, but losing this property when dried; and it is employed either boiled or raw. The latter undergoes no change , the former is cut in slices, boiled with a small quantity of terra japoηica, and then dried. Betel is compounded, therefore, of these three substances, with some additions or variations, according to the customs of the place where consumed; such as cardamums, and coarse pounded tobacco, by persons of more depraved taste. The union of the three ingredients is supposed to correct the effects which each would produce singly; the nut improves the bitterness of the leaf, and the lime prevents any injury to the stomach. W’hen combined, the first consequences are, reddening the saliva, giving a bright hue to the lips, and, in progress of time, rendering the teeth quite black. The saliva, however, will not be tinged if the chunam be omitted; and its pernicious operation on the enamel of the teeth may be averted by rubbing them with a preparation whereby they are coated with a black substance that does not readily yield to any dentifrice, and preserves them from corrosion. Its medicinal effects are the dispelling of nausea, exciting an appetite, and strengthening the stomach. It possesses nutritious and enlivening qualities, which render it particularly acceptable to its consumers. The terra japonica, above alluded to, is not a universal ingredient; it is used only in certain countries, and is generally supposed to be a preparation from the areca nut itself. It consists of two varieties, the one very astringent, the other less so, and rather sweet, which is preferred by the betel-eaters. To obtain the former, the nuts are taken from the tree, and boiled some hours in an iron vessel; they are then removed, and the water remaining is inspissated by continual boiling. The nuts being dried, undergo a second boiling, and, having been taken out, the water is also inspissated, whereby the best terra japonica is obtained. The nuts are then dried, cut in two equal parts, and sold. Or it is obtained by inspissated decoctions of the wood of the keira tree, or mimosa catechu. A great quantity of this substance is made in the Mysore, and some of inferior quality in Bengal. Probably it is something of this same kind that is prepared in Sumatra, under the name of catacamber, and chewed along with betel to give it an additional flavour.\n",
      "Betel is not only used as an article of luxury, but as a kind of ceremonial which regulates the intercourse of the more polished classes of the East. When any person of consideration waits on another, after the first salutations, betel is presented as a token of politeness: to omit it, on the one part, would be considered neglect, and its rejection would be judged an affront on the other. No one of inferior rank.addresses a dignified individual without the previous precaution of chewing betel; two people seldom meet without exchanging it; and it is always offered on the ceremonious interviews of public missionaries. In some countries it is not uncommon for the guest who receives the betel from his host, to pass it between his thumb and fore-finger, and apply his own chunam, which never gives offence, and is thought to have originated in guarding a stranger against the insidious conveyance of poison, formerly too frequently practised in destroying persons who were obnoxious. Philtres or amatory charms are still conveyed along with the chunam, and are conceived to consist of some powerful stimulants. Mahommedans abstain from this indulgence during the fast of Ramadan, though possibly not in every country, as it would be too great a privation; and the use of it is so interwoven with the existence of the natives of the warmer climates, that females of the higher ranks are said to pass their lives in doing little else than chewing betel. When the Cingalese retire to rest at night, they fill their mouths with it, and retain it there until they awake. According to Knox, who passed many years in captivity on the island of Ceylon, most people going abroad carry a small box of gold or silver, containing the ingredients for compounding betel; and the poor keep a constant supply about them in purses of coloured straw, securely lodged in a fold of their garments. The stand or box containing it is often the subject of elegant workmanship; it consists of silver, gold, or tortoise-shell, and forms a piece of ornamental furniture in the houses of the wealthy. It is sufficiently valuable to constitute a present between sovereigns.\n",
      "Extensive gardens for cultivating betel are formed in different parts of India. The soil most favourable for the palm is a black mould on a substratum of limestone, or intermixed with calcareous nodules. Here it is planted in rows, and carefully manured and watered during several years. It begins to bear from the eighth or tenth to the fifteenth year, and remains in perfection for thirty years, soon after which it either dies or is cut down. Some, however, continue producing fruit from the fiftieth to the seventieth, or even the hundredth year; but the produce gradually declines both in quantity and quality. It appears that a very fertile tree produces at an average 857 nuts, and an ordinary one 600; but this does not hold everywhere, as there are trees affording no more than 200. The betel-leaf is either cultivated in separate gardens, where a red stony soil on the side of a rising ground is preferred, and plantains or bamboos planted along with the vines, which are arranged in trenches to support them as they grow; or when an areca plantation is formed, and the palms are fifteen years old, cuttings of the vine are planted near the roots, and trained up to the trees. In twelve or eighteen months the leaves of the vine are fit for sale, and in three years they are full-sized; but in another year thev die, when all must be removed, and young plants immediately substituted for them. W'e do not know whether their duration is ever longer; but in the southern parts of Canara in India, the gardens require renewal every four years, and in eighteen or twenty the soil is considered tó be exhausted. These gardens are always surrounded by a hedge; sometimes the cultivators are annoyed with the depredations of squirrels and elephants. The crop of the areca is produced during three months; and the nuts being pulled, arc cut into seven or eight pieces each, and piled up in a heap; then equal quantities of it and terrajaponica, with a hundred leaves of betel-leaf, are beat together with water, and the juice strained.into a pot. This is mixed with a decoction of the bark of the mimosa indica and water, and the nuts from the whole heap are successively boiled in it. They are then exposed to be dried in the sun.\n",
      "Betel is a very considerable article of traffic in India and China, and, indeed, throughout Asia. In the British settlements of Bombay, Madras, and Bengal, the value of the imports amounted in a single year to L.138,836; and if the quantities consumed throughout the East are taken into view, it will appear surprising how they can be obtained. But, owing to the constant and extensive demand, the plants affording the necessary ingredients are carefully cultivated; and multitudes are employed and subsisted in the production of this eastern luxury, (n. n.)

      "one of the most celebrated Italian literati of the eighteenth century, was born at Mantua on the 18th of July 1718. After studying under the Jesuits in his native city and at Bologna, he entere in 1736 upon the noviciate of this society. He then undertook a new course of study; and afterwards taught t e belles lettres, from the year 1739 to 1744, at Brescia, where the Cardinal Quirini, Count Mazzuchelli, Count Duranti, and other scholars, formed an illustrious academy. He there began to distinguish himself by some pieces of poetry, composed as scholastic exercises. Being sent to Bologna to pursue his divinity, he continued, at the same time, to cultivate his poetical talent, and wrote also, for the theatre of the college, his tragedy of Jonathan. The number of learned and literary persons collected in this city exceeded by far what he had met with at Brescia. The Institute, recently founded by the Count Marsigli, the Clementine Academy of Design, the school of the astronomical poet Manfredi, the growing reputation of his ingenious and learned pupils Zanotti, Algarotti, and others, at this time fixed the attention of the literary world on Bologna. It was in the midst of this society, to which he was admitted, that Bettinelli completed his education, and attained the age of thirty. He went in 1748 to Venice, where he became professor of rhetoric. He left it for various missions, and returned to it often. We may see by his epistles in free verse, or sciolti, that he was connected on friendly terms with all that this city and state could boast as most illustrious. He was destined by the superiors of his order for the oratorical department; but the weakness of his chest compelled him to relinquish it. The superintendence of the college of nobles at Parma was intrusted to him in 1751; and he principally directed the studies of poetry and history, and the entertainments of the theatre. He remained here eight years, but not without visiting, at intervals, different cities of Italy, either on the affairs of his order, or for pleasure, or for health. In 1755 he undertook a longer journey, traversed part of Germany, proceeded as far as Strasburg and Nancy, and returned by way of Germany into Italy, taking with him two young princes, sons or nephews of the prince of Hohenlohe, who had requested him to take charge of their education. He made, the year following, another journeyinto France, along with the eldest of these two young princes, and lodged, while at Paris, at the College of Louis le Grand. It was during this excursion that he wrote the famous Letters of Virgil, which were published at Venice with his sciolti verses, and those of Frugoni and Algarotti. The opinions, and we may add without much hesitation, the literary heresies, maintained in these letters against the two great luminaries of Italian poetry, and particularly against Dante, created him many enemies, and, what was still more unpleasant to him, embroiled him with Algarotti. Willing to know something more of France than Paris, he made several excursions into Normandy and other provinces; he went also into Lorraine, to the court of King Stanislaus, and thence proceeded to Lyons, and afterwards to Geneva. Soon after his arrival he went to visit Voltaire. This celebrated writer sent to his inn an edition of his works, upon which he inscribed this stanza, in allusion to Bettinellľs Letters of Virgil:\n",
      "Compatriote de Virgile,\n",
      "Et son secretaire aujourd’hui,\n",
      "C’est à vous d’e'crire sous lui;\n",
      "Vous avez son âme et son style.\n",
      "From Geneva, where he consulted Tronchin the physician, Bettinelli proceeded to Marseilles, from thence to Nismes, and returned by Genoa to Italy and Parma, where he arrived in 1759. The same year he took a journey to Venice, and afterwards to Verona, where he meant to settle. Ŗc resided here till 1767. Having resumed the occupations of preaching and teaching, he, according to the Chevalier Pindemonti, in his Poesie Campestri, converted the youth to God in the church, and to good taste in his own ιouse. He afterwards lived for some years at Modena, and he had just been appointed professor of rhetoric there, Mien, i∏ 1773 the or d er 0 f Jesuits was abolished in Italy.\n",
      "He then returned into his own country, where he resumed his literary labours with new ardour. He there published several works, and regretting, as it appears, that he had written so much in his life without having been able, till then, to write any thing to please the women, perhaps in consequence of the habit which he wore, he determined to make up for lost time by publishing, one after the other, his Correspondence between two Ladies, his Letters to Lesbia on Epigrams, his Letters on the Fine Arts, and, lastly, his Twenty four Letters on Love. These he published in 1796, when the war raged in all parts of Italy, and when the siege laid by the French to Mantua had compelled him to leave it. He retired to Verona, and there formed the most intimate friendship with the Chevalier Hippolito Pindemonti, notwithstanding the disproportion of their age. In 1797, after Mantua had surrendered, he returned thither. Though nearly eighty years old, he resumed his labours and his customary manner of life. He began in 1799 a complete edition of his works, which was finished at Venice in twenty-four volumes duodecimo. Arrived at the age of ninety years, he still retained the gaiety and vivacity of his mind, and died on the 13th of∙September 1808, after fifteen days of illness, with the firmness of a philosopher and the sentiments of a believer. Without giving a list of all his works, or specifying the separate editions, it will be sufficient to refer to them in the order in which they are placed in this last edition.\n",
      "1. Ragionamenti Filosofici, con Annotaziom. These philosophical discourses, which occupy the first two volumes, form a system of religious morality, in which the author endeavours to exhibit man under all his relations, and in all states, following the order of the sacred writings, and treating, first, of man as created, as reasonable, as lord of the other creatures, and in all the different states of solitude, society, innocence, error, repentance, &c. He only finished ten of these discourses. The notes arc themselves little philosophical treatises on beauty in general, on beauty of expression, on physiognomy, &c.\n",
      "2. Dell ’ Entusiasmo delle Belle Arti, two volumes, in three parts, of which the last is an appendix to the two others, and treats of the history of enthusiasm in different nations, and the influence which climates, governments, and all the modifications of society, have had on enthusiasm. In the first two parts the author, who was not very subject to enthusiasm, sometimes writes a little obscurely on it, becomes turgid when he endeavours to be sublime, and remains a stranger to the warmth which he affects.\n",
      "3. Dialoghi d' Amore, 2 vols. The object of the author is to point out the influence which the imagination, vanity, friendship, marriage, honour, the love of glory, the study of the sciences, and fashion, have on the passion of love; and afterwards to trace the influence which it exercises on the productions of the arts of genius, and of the dramatic arts in particular. The last dialogue, which is entitled On Love and on Petrarch, is followed by the Eulogy of Petrarch, one of the author’s best pieces.\n",
      "4. Risorgimento negli Study, ηelle Arti e nd Costumi dopo il Mille, 3 vols.; a work regarded in Italy as superficial, but which, nevertheless, contains some enlightened sentiments, and in which facts are often presented under a philosophical point of view, which is not destitute either of novelty or justness.\n",
      "5. Delle Lettere e delle Arti Mantouane: Lettere ed Arti Modeηesi, 1 vol.; almost entirely filled with anecdotes of literary history, tending to the glory of Mantua, the country of the author.\n",
      "6. Lettere dieci di Virgilio agli Arcadi, 1 vol. These letters, which have been translated into French by Μ. de Pommereul, Paris, 1778, are, of all the works of Bettinelli, that which has attracted most notice. They are followed in this volume by Letters from an Englishman to a Venetian, which treat somewhat vaguely on different topics of literature.\n",
      "7. Italian Letters from a Lady to her Friend on the Fine Arts, and Letters from a Friend, copied from the Originals, 3 volumes, of which the letters on the fine arts occupy only the first.\n",
      ", 8. Poetry, 3 vols., containing seven small poems, sixteen epistles in easy verse, sonnets, canzonets, &c. Without ever showing himself a great poet, the author is always elegant and ingenious. These three volumes are preceded by a well-written discourse on Italian poetry. Several of the epistles and smaller poems are seasoned with Attic salt. Such is the poem in four cantos entitled Le Pac-colte, in which Bettinelli very happily turns into ridicule those insipid collections of verses which in his time appeared on every occasion in Italy.\n",
      "9. Tragedies, 2 vols. These tragedies are Xerxes, Jonathan, Demetrius Poliorcetes, and Pome Delivered, a translation from Voltaire. Prefixed to them are some letters written in French, and a discourse in Italian on the Italian tragedy. Some letters on tragedy, among others one on the tragedies of Alfieri, follow; and the second of these two volumes concludes with a eulogy on Father Granelli, a Jesuit, a preacher, and a poet, author of some tragedies, which are in much esteem, particularly for the elegance and beauty of the style.\n",
      "10. Lettere a Lesbia Cidonia sopra gli Epigrαmmi, 2 vols, consisting of twenty-five letters, intermixed with epigrams, madrigals, and other light pieces, translated and original.\n",

      "a principality of Asia, situated in the north-west of Hindostan, but the precise dimensions and limits of which are scarcely ascertained by modern geographers. It extends from about 72. 10. to 75. 15. east longitude, and from 27. 40. to 29. 45. north latitude; and its superficial area probably amounts to not less than 17,000 square miles. It is bounded on the north by a country occupied by the Batties or people of Bat-neer; on the east by the territories of Hurriana or Shck-hawuttee, in the province of Delhi; on the south-east by Jeypour; on the south-west by Jesselmere; and on the west by Bahawulpoor. But these may be deemed obscure limits, for the countries named in them are scarcely better known than the subject of this article.\n",
      "A vast proportion of the soil of Beykaneer is a barren sandy desert, or a hard flat clay, sounding like a board under horses’ feet, and entirely destitute of inhabitants, water, and vegetation. Many miles are occupied in hills and valleys of loôse heavy sand; the former, from twenty to a hundred feet in height, shifting their position and altering their shape according to the influence of the wind; and, during the heats of summer, clouds of moving sand threaten to overwhelm the traveller. Sometimes the phenomenon called mirage is exhibited in this desert, being that species of optical illusion, by which a spectator is induced to believe that he beholds a lake or a wide river well defined before him, reflecting surrounding objects, while there is nothing in view but a level uninterrupted surface.\n",
      "Vegetation is exceedingly scanty throughout, except in a few patches, which are skilfully and industriously cultivated; and the whole country seems to depend on external supplies of grain. Nevertheless, in the midst of arid tracts, the water-melon, a juicy fruit, grows in profusion, attaining the remarkable size of three or four feet in circumference, from a stalk no larger than that of the common melon. The seeds are sown by the natives, and also grow wild; but it is difficult to account for such an enlargement of size with so little moisture. Water seems to be obtained only at an immense depth. The wells at Beykaneer are often from 300 to 345 feet in depth, yet not above three in diameter; they are all lined with masonry; and one of the most curious objects in the city of Beykancer is considered to be a well 300 feet deep, and fifteen or twenty in diameter, worked by four pair of oxen drawing as many buckets of water. The water is always brackish, scanty, and insalubrious; and this, combined with the nature of the soil, principally occasions the prevalent sterility of the country.\n",
      "The wild ass, remarkable for its speed and its shyness, is found here, sometimes solitary, but oftener in herds. At a kind of shuffling trot, peculiar to itself, it will leave the best horses behind. Antelopes are seen in some parts; also foxes, but smaller than those of Britain; and the desert rat is found in great numbers, occasioning serious inconvenience to equestrians, from the holes it makes where the ground is sufficiently solid. Of domesticated animals, horses, bullocks, and camels, are in abundance; the last being kept in great herds for various purposes. The horses brought from the vicinity of the Lacky Jungle, an adjoining district, where they are reared on excellent pasture, and with the strictest attention, are much prized. But the original breed was greatly improved by the introduction of fine Persian horses, brought hither during the successive invasions of Hindostan by Nadir Shah and other eastern potentates. At present they bear very high prices, some of them bringing even L.250 sterling, a large sum in a poor country. But some decrease in the extent and quality of the breed has lately resulted from the impolitic conduct of the officers oí the rajah of Beykaneer, by whom the owners are compelled to sell them at an under value. When purchased thus, the horses are sent on speculation to different parts of the Indian peninsula.\n",
      "We are little acquainted with the manners and customs of the inhabitants of this country, otherwise than by their correspondence with those of the same tribes disseminated elsewhere in India. The natives are divided into two principal classes, Rajpoots and Jauts; the former the rulers, the latter the mass of the people. The Jauts are of small stature, black, ill-looking, and bear strong indications of poverty and wretchedness; the Rajpoots are stout and handsome, with Jewish features, of haughty manners an indolent disposition, and greatly addicted to intoxication with opium. It is doubtful whether the Rajpoots of Beykaneer entertain those elevated and magnanimous sentiments so peculiar to their tribe, whether they are animated by that high sense of honour and impatience of indignity which, united to the violence of their passions, lead to the most terrible catastrophes. When a man of rank finds himself beset by an enemy, from whom he has no chance of escape, he inquires whether, by surrender, he can preserve the honour of his family; should the answer be equivocal or unfavourable, he clothes himself in yellow, the symbol of despair, and repairing along with his nearest relatives to the apartments of the females, the whole are involved in promiscuous destruction; nor is it uncommon, on such occasions, for the women themselves to commit suicide. The Rajpoot then rushes furiously against his enemies, and though he should be successful and prevail over them, rather than survive his dire calamity he plunges his sword in his own breast. The same sense of dishonour induces females of rank to deem themselves contaminated by the gaze of any man but their most intimate relatives; and it also leads them to ascend the funeral pile of their husbands, lest, by survivance, they should lose the consideration of the world. The people of the East, while more placid and resigned to fate, are, at the same time, agitated by more acute and ungovernable passions than the inhabitants of the Western World. A Mahommedan officer of high rank, who was hard pressed by a victorious enemy, approaching the place where his wife and daughter had sought refuge on the banks of a river, gave the following account of his conduct: “I leapt from my horse, and seizing each by a hand, rushed with them into the water up to their waists, and covered the rest of their persons with a cloth: I drew my sword to defend them with my life from further insult, and, happily for my honour, their faces were not seen by the eyes of a stranger.” Of late the Rajpoots of Beykaneer have been accused of being cruel and treacherous.\n",
      "The population of this territory is altogether uncertain; but, from the scarcity of water, it is probably very much restricted. The inhabitants are dispersed in towns and villages, of which Beykaneer, near the southern frontier, in about 27° 55' north latitude, the capital, and Churoo, on the eastern frontier, are the principal. Beykaneer, surrounded by lofty white walls, strengthened with numerous round towers crowned by battlements, presents the imposing picture of a great and magnificent city in the midst of a wilderness. But on entering the gates the illusion vanishes; and it is found to consist, for the most part, of huts built of mud, and painted red. Nevertheless, there are some high houses, several temples, and at one corner ι lofty and fine-looking fortress, a quarter of a mile square, environed by a wall thirty feet high, and a good dry ditch. The interior is a confused assemblage of towers and battlements, overtopped by houses; and it contains the royal palace, a curious old edifice. Churoo, independent of the suburbs, is above a mile and a half in circuit, and, althoug situate among sand hills, has a handsome appearance. A the houses have terraces, and are built of a pure win e limestone, like those of Beykaneer. Villages are occasionally seen in the most dismal situations, to which their mi  serable aspect corresponds. They consist of a few round huts of straw, with low walls, and conical roofs like little stacks of corn, and surrounded by hedges of thorny branches stuck in the sand. A modern traveller, describing the town of Pooggul, observes, “If I could present to my reader the foreground of high sand hills, the village of straw huts, the clay walls of the little fort going to ruins, as the soil which supported them was blown away by the winds, and the sea of sand which formed the rest of the prospect, he would probably feel, as I did, a sort of wonder at the people who could reside in so dismal a wilderness, and of horror at the life to which they seemed to be condemned.” The city of Beykaneer is said to stand 219 miles north-west of Delhi, but its real position is southwest, and we conceive the distance to be not less than 260 or 280 miles. Fortresses are not so common in this territory as in a large portion of Hindostan, owing to the equality of the surface.\n",
      "Scarcely any thing definite can be said regarding the occupation and pursuits of the people in their trade and manufactures. Cattle of an inferior breed, and horses, are the only exports; rice, sugar, opium, and indigo, are obtained from the Punjab; salt from Samber; wheat from Jeypour; and spices, copper, and coarse cloth, are imported from Jesselmere.\n",
      "Beykaneer is governed by a rajah, who is a sovereign and independent prince, though he seems formerly to have been tributary to the monarch of Delhi, and even acknowledged the supremacy of Britain when Delhi had fallen under a foreign power. He enjoys an absolute sway over the lives and property of his subjects, and maintains considerable state in his reception of strangers. His revenues do not exceed L.50,000 per annum, though occasionally augmented to nearly double that sum by vexatious imposts on merchandise in transitu. The consequence is, that those caravans which were accustomed to take the route of this province from Surat to Tatta, a town on the Indus, follow another course, i\n",

      "celebrated as an anatomist and physiologist, was born in France, at a village called Thoirette, on the 11th of November 1771. Great attention was paid to his education by his father, who was himself a physician, and who initiated him at an early age in those studies which were to prepare him more particularly for the profession to which he had destined him. He studied first at the college of Nantua, and afterwards at a seminary at Lyons; and was early distinguished for that activity of mind and facility in acquiring knowledge, which are the sure presage of great attainments at a mature age. In mathematics, and the physical sciences more especially dependent on abstract reasoning, for which he showed a remarkable predilection, he made rapid progress. He afterwards became passionately fond of natural history, and devoted all his time to this new study. He had already made considerable advances in this branch of science, as he had before done in natural philosophy and mathematics, when his ardour was suddenly checked by the reflection that he was engaged in pursuits that were boundless in their object, and that were in danger of leading him too far from his future profession, through which alone he aspired to celebrity. Bidding adieu, therefore, with a singular effort of resolution, to his favourite occupations, he applied himself at once with great diligence to the study of anatomy and surgery, under the guidance of Petit, who was chief surgeon to the Hôtel Dieu at Lyons. It is also curious that, some time after he had fully engaged in this course of instruction, he experienced a relapse of his passion for mathematics to such a degree, that, yielding to the fascination, he resumed his early studies, in which, however, he had sufficient discretion to restrict himself within such limits as did not interfere with his medical pursuits. Petit soon discerned the superior talents of his pupil; and, although the latter had scarcely attained the age of twenty, employed him constantly as his assistant in his professional labours. The revolutionary disturbances, which raged with so much fury at Lyons, unfortunately interrupted his progress, in the midst of the flattering prospects which were opening to him; and flying from the horrors of the siege which that devoted city was about to sustain, he took refuge in Paris about the end of the year 1793. He there resumed the course of his professional studies, and became the assiduous attendant upon the lectures of the celebrated Dessault; and in this, as in the former instance, became in no long time the companion and friend of his instructor. His merit was brought to the notice of Dessault by an accidental circumstance. It had been an established custom in the school, that the substance of the lecture of the preceding day should be recapitulated, as an exercise, before the whole class, by one of the pupils selected for this purpose. It happened one day that the pupil on whom this task devolved was absent at the time when he was expected to perform it, and the professor asked if anyone among his auditory would offer himself as a substitute. Bichat boldly came forward to volunteer his services, and acquitted himself to the admiration of all his hearers. The subject he had to explain was the theory and treatment of fractures of the clavicle. The exact analysis which he made of the instructions contained in the lecture, the copiousness and novelty of his illustrations, and the spirit of order and of method which characterized the whole of hiś exposition, joined to the modesty with which he stated some doubts, as well as. some original views which he had taken of the subject, revealed at once the extent and vigour of his genius, and the expectations which might justly be entertained of his future eminence in his profession. Dessault, in particular, was strongly impressed with the superiority he had manifested over all his other pupils; and from that day he became an inmate in his house, and was treated in all respects as an adopted son. The opportunities which fortune thus placed within his reach were eagerly employed; and the favoured pupil showed himself worthy of the protection and confidence which he received. We find him, between the years 1793 and 1795, actively participating in all the labours of Dessault, visiting his patients both at the hospital and in private, accompanying him everywhere as his assistant in his operations, and writing the greater part of his letters in answer to those who consulted him from a distance. His exertions by no means closed with the day; and he passed a great portion of the night in assisting, to conduct the experimental researches on the diseases of bones, in which that able surgeon was engaged, and in consulting, previously to each lecture, the works of the ancient authors on the subjects to which they related. Whatever Dessault expressed a desire to have done, and lie often required more than an ordinary person would have supposed it possible to perform, was sure to be accomplished.within the requisite time by his indefatigable pupil. Notwithstanding these multiplied occupations, Bichat found means to prosecute his own researches in anatomy and physiology, to which he devoted every interval of leisure he could seize. The sudden death of Dessault, who was snatched from the world in the meridian of his fame, was a severe stroke of adversity to Bichat; but the event, though it deeply afflicted, did not discourage him; and though it might interrupt for a time, did not eventually relax, his efforts at advancement. His first care seems to have been to acquit himself of the obligations he owed his benefactor, by contributing to the support of his widow and her son; and by conducting to a close the fourth volume of Dessaulťs Journal de Chirurgie. To this volume he subjoined a biographical memoir of its author, in which he pays a just tribute to his merit. His next object was to re-unite and digest in one body the different surgical doctrines which Dessault had advanced in fugitive papers, published in various periodical works. Of these he, in 1797, composed a work, in two volumes octavo, entitled OEuvres Chirurgicales de Dessault, ou Tableau de sa Doctrine, et de sa Pratique dans le Traitement des Maladies Externes; a work in which, although he professes only to explain the ideas of another, he developes them with the clearness and copiousness of one who is in perfect possession of the subject which he treats. He was now at liberty to pursue the full bent of his genius, and soon arrived at those comprehensive and masterly views of physiology which, when afterwards developed in his writings, gained him so much applause. Undisturbed by the storms which agitated the political world, he pursued with steadiness the course he had meditated, and directed his more immediate attention to surgery, which it was then his design to practise. We meet with many proofs of his industry and success at this period in the Recueil de la Société Médicale J Emulation, an association of which Bichat was one of the most zealous and active members. Three memoirs which he communicated were published by the society in 1796; the first describing an improvement in the instrument for trepanning; the second detailing a new process which he devised for the ligature of polypi; and the third, in the distinction to be observed in fractures of the clavicle, between those cases requiring the assistance of art, and those in which its interference would be of no avail. In 1797 we find him undertaking the arduous task of instructing others, which he commenced by a course of anatomical demonstrations. Not expecting any great number of pupils, he had hired a small room for the purpose; but his merit as a teacher soon attracting a crowd of auditors, he was obliged to enlarge his theatre, and was also encouraged to extend the plan of his lectures, and to announce what had never hitherto been attempted by one so young and inexperienced, a course of operative surgery. If the boldness of the enterprise was calculated to excite surprise, his success in the execution of it was still more astonishing. His reputation was now fully established, and he was ever after the favourite teacher with the students who resorted to the capital. In the following year, 1798, he gave, in addition to his course on anatomy and operative surgery, a separate course of physiology. But the exertion of speaking which these numerous courses of lectures, all of which he. conducted at the same time, required, was more than his frame could bear; and a dangerous haemoptysis, with which he was seized in the midst of his labours, obliged him to interrupt them for a time, and warned him that there are limits to human strength. But the danger was no sooner passed than the lesson seems to have been disregarded; for we find him plunging into new engagements with the same ardour as before. He had now scope in his physiological lectures for a fuller exposition of his original views in the animal economy, which were no sooner made known to his pupils, than they excited much attention in the medical schools at Paris; and he was induced to publish them in a more authentic form. Sketches of these doctrines were given by him in three papers contained in the Memoirs of the Société Médicale ďEmulation. The first is on the synovial membranes; in which he gives a more clear description of the organ that secretes synovia, a fluid, the origin of which had been a matter of much controversy. The next contains an account of the membranes of the human body in general, which he considers apart from the organs they invest and support, and which they serve to supply with vessels; and regards as performing offices in the economy distinct from those of the organs with which they are so connected. His last memoir relates to the symmetry, which is so remarkable a feature in all those parts of the body that are the instruments of the animal functions, and \n",

      "Bill of Exchange is an open letter of request from one man to another, desiring him to pay a sum named therein to a third person on his account; by which means a person in the most distant part of the world may have money remitted to him from any trading country. For instance, if A lives in Jamaica, and owes B, who lives in England L,1000, and if C be going from England to Jamaica, he may pay B this L.I000, and take a bill of exchange drawn by B in England upon A in Jamaica, and receive it when he arrives there. B therefore receives his debt by transferring it to C, who carries over his money in paper credit, without danger of loss or robbery. The person, however, who writes this letter, is called, in law, the drawer; he to whom it is written, the drawee; and the third person or negociator to whom it is payable, whether specially named or described generally as the bearer, is called the payee.\n",
      "These bills are either foreign or inland; foreign, when drawn by a merchant residing abroad upon his correspondent in England, or vice versa; and inland, when both the drawer and the drawee reside within the kingdom. Formerly foreign bills of exchange were much more regarded in the eye of the law than inland ones, as being thought of more public concern in the advancement of trade and commerce; but now, by several statutes, inland bills of exchange are put upon the same footing as foreign ones, so that in law there is no manner of difference between them. In drawing foreign bills of exchange, it is customary to frame two or three of the same tenor and date, to be sent by different conveyances, that in case of accident the person to whom they are transmitted may not be disappointed; in which case it is mentioned in the body of the bill, that it is the first, second, or third bill of exchange, and when one is paid it discharges all the rest.\n",

This petition, when founded on facts that may be or actually are disputed, is referred to a committee of members, who examine the matter alleged, and report thereon to the house; and then (or otherwise upon the mere petition) leave is given to bring in the bill. In public matters, the bill is brought in upon motion made to the house, without any petition at all. Formerly all bills were drawn in the form of petitions, which were entered upon the rolls of parliament, with the king’s answer subjoined,not in any settled form of words, but as the circumstances ot the case required; and at the end of each parliament the judges drew them in the form of a statute, which was entered on the statute-books. To prevent mistakes and abuses, the statutes were in the reign of Henry V. drawn up by the judges before the end of the parliament; and in the reign of Henry VI. bills in the form of acts according to the modern custom were first introduced.\n",
      "The persons directed to bring in the bill present it ι∏ a competent time to the house, drawn out on paper, with a multitude of blanks, or void spaces, where any thing occurs that is dubious, or necessary to be settled by the parliament itself, such especially as the precise dates, the nature and quantity of penalties, or the sums of money to be raised. In the house of lords, if the bill originates there, and is of a private nature, it is referred to two of the judges, who examine and report on the state of the facts alleged, and settle all points of technical propriety. This is read a first time, and at a convenient distance a second time; and after each reading, the speaker opens to the house the substance of the bill, and puts the question, whether it shall proceed any further. The introduction of the bill may be originally opposed, as the bill itself may also be at any of the readings; and, if the opposition succeed, either at the commencement or at any of the subsequent stages, the bill must be dropped for that session.\n",
      "After the second reading, it is committed, or, in other words, referred to a committee; and This is either selected by the house, as happens in matters of minor importance, or else, upon a bill of consequence, the house resolves itself into a committee of the whole. A committee of the whole house is composed of every member; and, to form it, the speaker quits the chair, another member being appointed chairman, and may sit and debate as a private member. In these committees the bill is debated clause by clause, amendments are made, the blanks are filled up, and sometimes the bill is entirely new-modelled. After it has gone through the committee, the chairman reports it to the house, with such amendments as the committee may have made; and then the house considers the whole bill again, and the question is repeatedly put upon every clause and amendment. When the house has agreed to the amendments of the committee, and sometimes added new amendments of its own, the bill is then ordered to be engrossed, or written in a strong gross hand on one or more rolls of parchment fastened together; after which it is read a third time, when amendments are sometimes made on it; and if a new clause be added, it is done by tacking a separate piece of parchment to the bill, which is called a rider. The speaker then states the contents generally; and, in holding it up in his hands, puts the question, whether the bill shall pass. If the decision be in tlιe affirmative, the title is then settled; and this used to be a general one for all the acts passed in the session, till the fifth year of Henry VIII., when distinct titles were introduced for each chapter. One of the members is then directed to carry it to the lords and desire their concurrence; and he, attended by several more, carries it accordingly to the bar of the house of peers, and there delivers it to their speaker, who comes down from his woolsack to receive it.\n",
      "In the house of peers, it passes through the same forms as in the other house, except engrossing, which is already done; and if it be rejected, no more notice is taken of it, and it is allowed to drop sub silentio, to prevent unbecoming altercations. But if it be agreed to, the lords send a message by two masters in chancery, or sometimes by two of the judges, that they have agreed to the same; and the bill remains with them if they have made no amendments on it. But if any amendments be made, such amendments are sent down with the bill to receive the concurrence of the commons; and if the commons disapprove of the amendments, a conference usually follows between members deputed from each house, who for the most part settle and adjust the difference; but if both houses remain inflexible, the bill is dropped. If the commons agree to amendments, the bill is sent back to the lords by one of the members, \"With a message to inform them of this concurrence. The same forms are observed, mutatis mutandis, when the bill originates in the house of lords. But when an act of grace or pardon is passed, it is first signed by his majesty, and then read once only in each of the houses, without any new engrossing or amendment. And when a bill has passed through its various stages in both houses, it is deposited in the house of peers, to await the royal assent; except in the case of a bill of supply, which, after receiving the concurrence of the lords, is sent back to the house of commons.\n",
      "The royal assent may be given two ways :—First, in person, when the king comes to the house of peers, in his crown and royal robes, and, summoning the commons to the bar, the titles of all the bills that have passed both houses are read; and the king’s answer is declared by the clerk of the parliament in Norman-French. If the king consents to a public bill, the clerk usually declares, Le roy le veut, “ the king wills it so to be if to a private bill, Soit fait comme il est désiré, “be it as it is desired.” If the king refuses his assent, it is in the qualified terms of Le roy s'avisera, “ the king will advise upon it.” When a bill of supply is passed, it is carried up and presented to the king by the speaker of the house of commons, and the royal assent is thus expressed: Le roy remercie ses loyal subjects, accepte leur benevolence, et aussi le veut; “the king thanks his loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence, and wills it so to be.” In case of an act of grace, which originally proceeds from the crown and has the royal assent in the first stage of it, the clerk of the parliament thus pronounces the gratitude of the subject: Les prélats, seigneurs, et commons, en ce present parliament assembles, au nom de touts vos autres subjects, remercient tres humblement votre majesté, et prient a Pieu vous donner en santé bonne vie et longue; “the prelates, lords, and commons in this present parliament assembled, in the name of all your other subjects, most humbly thank your m\n",

      "a clergyman, was born at Annan, in the south of Scotland, in the year 1721. His father was a bricklayer; but, though in this humble sphere of life, he was of a respectable character, and not deficient in knowledge and urbanity. The son was not quite six months old when he lost his eye-sight by the small-pox. This misfortune rendered him incapable of learning any of the mechanical arts; wherefore his father kept him at home, and, with the assistance of some friends, fostered that inclination which, at a very early period, he showed for books. This was done by reading to him, first the simple sort of publications which are commonly put into the hands of children, and then several of our best authors, as Milton, Spenser, Prior, Pope, and Addison. His companions, whom his early gentleness and kindness of disposition, as well as their compassion for his misfortune, strongly attached to him, were also very assiduous in their good offices, particularly in reading to instruct and amuse him. By their assistance he acquired some knowledge of the Latin tongue; but he did not attend a grammar-school till a more advanced period of life. Poetry was even then his favourite reading; and he found an enthusiastic delight in the works of the best English poets, as well as in those of his countryman Allan Ramsay. Even at so early an age as twelve he began to write poems, one of which is preserved in the collection which was published after his death; and it is not perhaps inferior to any of the premature compositions of boys assisted by the best education, which, in most cases, are only recalled into notice by the subsequent fame of their authors.\n",
      "Blacklock had attained the age of nineteen when his father was killed by the accidental falling of a malt-kiln belonging to his son-in-law. This loss, heavy to any one at that early age, would have nevertheless been comparatively light to a young man possessing the ordinary means of support, and the ordinary advantages of education; but to him, thus suddenly deprived of that support on which his youth had leaned, destitute of almost every resource which industry affords to those who have the blessing of sight, with a body feeble and delicate from nature, and with a mind peculiarly susceptible, this bereavement was doubly severe, and threw over his spirits that desponding gloom to which he gave expression in the following pathetic lines :—\n",
      "Dejecting prospect! soon the hapless hour\n",
      "May come, perhaps this moment it impends.\n",
      "Which drives me forth to penury and cold,\n",
      "Naked, and beat by all the storms of heav’n,\n",
      "Friendless and guideless to explore my way;\n",
      "Till, on cold earth this poor unsheltered head\n",
      "Reclining, vainly from the ruthless blast\n",
      "Respite I beg, and in the shock expire.\n",
      "He lived with his mother for about a year after his father’s death, and began tobe distinguished as a young man of uncommon parts and genius. At this time, however, his efforts were unassisted by learning; the circumstances of his family affording him no better education than the smattering of Latin which his companions had taught him, and the recollection of the few English authors  which they, or his father in the intervals of his professional labours, had read to him. But poetry, although it attains its highest perfection in a cultivated soil, grows perhaps as luxuriantly in a wild one. To it he was devoted from his earliest days; and about this time several of his poetical productions began to be handed about, which considerably enlarged the circle of his friends and acquaintance. Some of his compositions having been shown to Dr Stevenson, an eminent physician of Edinburgh, when accidentally at Dumfries on a professional visit, that gentleman formed the benevolent design of carrying him to the Scottish metropolis, and giving to his natural endowments the assistance of a classical education. Blacklock, in consequence, came to Edinburgh in the year 1741, and was enrolled a student of divinity in the university there, though without any particular view of entering into the church. In this university he continued his studies under the patronage of Dr Stevenson till the year 1745, when he retired to Dumfries, and resided in the house of Mr M‘Murdo, who had married his sister, during the whole time of the civil war, which then raged in the country, and particularly disturbed the tranquillity of the metropolis. When peace had been restored to the nation, he returned to the university, and pursued his studies for six years longer. During this residence in Edinburgh, he made the acquaintance of several literary men, particularly that of Mr Hume, who attached himself warmly to Mr Blacklock’s interests, and was afterwards particularly useful to him in the publication of the quarto edition of his poems, which was published by subscription in London in the year 1756. Previously to this, two editions in octavo had been published at Edinburgh, the first in 1746, and the second in 1754.\n",
      "In the course of his education at Edinburgh he acquired a proficiency in the learned languages, and became more a master of the French tongue than was then common in that city. For this last acquisition he was chiefly indebted to the social intercourse to which he had the good fortune to be admitted in the house of Provost Alexander, who had married a native of France. At the university he attained a knowledge of the various branches of philosophy and theology, to which his course of study naturally led, and acquired at the same time a considerable fund of learning and information in those various departments of science and literature, from which his want of sight did not absolutely exclude him.\n",
      "In 1757 he began a course of study, with a view to give lectures in oratory to young gentlemen intended for the bar or the pulpit. On this occasion he wrote to Mr Hume, informed him of his plan, and requested his assistance in the prosecution of it. But Mr Hume doubting the probability of its succeeding, he abandoned the project; and then, for the first time, adopted the decided intention of going into the church of Scotland. After applying closely for a considerable time to the study of theology, he passed the usual trials in the presbytery of Dumfries, and was by that presbytery licensed as a preacher of the gospel in the year 1759. In this capacity he obtained high reputation, and was fond of composing sermons, of which he has left some volumes in manuscript, as also a treatise on morals.\n",
      "In 1762 he married Miss Sarah Johnston, daughter of Mr Joseph Johnston, surgeon in Dumfries; a connection which formed the great solace and blessing of his future life, and gave him, with the tenderness of a wife, all the care and attention of a guardian and a friend. This event took place a few days before he was ordained as minister of the town and parish of Kirkcudbright, in consequence of a presentation from the crown, obtained for him by the Earl of Selkirk. But the inhabitants of the parish,—whether from that violent aversion to patronage, which was then so universal in the southern parts of Scotland, from some political disputes which at that time subsisted between them and the patron, or from those prejudices which many of them might naturally enough entertain against a pastor deprived of sight, or perhaps from all these causes united,—were so extremely disinclined to receive him as their minister, that after a legal dispute of nearly two years, it was thought expedient by his friends, as it had always been wished by himself, to compromise the matter, by resigning his right to the living, and accepting a moderate annuity in its stead. With this slender provision he removed to Edinburgh in 1764; and to make up by his industry a more comfortable and decent subsistence, he adopted the plan of receiving into his house as boarders a certain number of young gentlemen, whose studies in languages and philosophy he might, if necessary, assist. In this situation he continued till the year 1787, when he found that his time of life and state of health required a degree of quiet and repose which induced him to discontinue receiving boarders. In 1767 the degree of doctor in divinity was conferred on him by the University and Marischal College of Aberdeen.\n",
      "In the occupation which he had thus exercised for so many years of his life, no teacher was ever perhaps more agreeable to his pupils, nor any master of a family more beloved by its inmates, than Dr Blaçklock. The gentleness of his manners, the benignity of his disposition, and that warm interest in the happiness of others which led him so constantly to promote it, were qualities that could not fail to procure him the love and regard of the young people committed to his charge; whilst the society which respect for his character and his genius often assembled at his house, afforded them advantages rarely to be obtained in establishments of a similar kind.\n",
      "In this mixed society he appeared to forget the privation of sight, and the melancholy which at other times it produced in his mind. He entered, with all the cheerful playfulness of a young man, into the sprightly narratives, sportful fancies, and humorous jests of those around him. Next to conversation, music was perhaps the source of his greatest delight; for he not only relished it highly, but was himself a tolerable performer on several instruments, particularly the flute. He generally carried in his pocket a small flageolet, on which he played his favourite tunes; and he was not displeased when asked in company to play or to sing them,—a natural feeling for a blind man, who thus adds a scene to the little and confined drama of his society.\n",
      "Of the happiness of others, however, we are incompetent judges. Companionship and sympathy bring forth those gay colours of mirth and cheerfulness which perhaps serve to cover the sadness we have no opportunity of witnessing. Of a blind man’s condition we are particularly liable to form a mistaken estimate; we give him credit for\n",

      "----\n",
      "a famous English admiral, born in August 1589, at Bridgewater, in Somersetshire, where he was educated at the grammar-school. In 1615 he went from thence to Oxford, where he was entered at St Alban’s Hall; he subsequently removed to Wadham College; and, on the 10th of February 1617, he took the degree of bachelor of arts. In 1623 he wrote a copy of verses on the death of Mr Camden, and soon after left the university. He was pretty early tinctured with republican, principles, and disliking that severity with which Laud, then bishop of Bath and Wells, pressed uniformity in his diocese, lie began to fall into the puritanical opinions. His natural bluntness causing his principles to be well known, the puritan party returned him member for Bridgewater in 1640; and he served in the parliament army with great courage during the civil war. But when the king was brought to trial, he highly disapproved the measure as illegal, and was frequently heard to say that “he would as freely venture his life to save the king, as ever he did to serve the parliament.” But this is thought to have been chiefly owing to the humanity of his temper, since after the death of the king he fell in wholly with the republican party, and, next to Cromwell, was the ablest officer of whom the parliament could boast.\n",
      "In 1648-9 he was appointed, in conjunction with Colonel Dean and Colonel Popham, to command the fleet; and soon after blockaded Prince Maurice and Prince Rupert in Kinsale harbour. But the latter getting out, Blake followed them from port to port, and at last attacked them in that of Malaga, where he burnt and destroyed their whole fleet excepting two ships; the Reformation, in which Prince Rupert himself was, and the Swallow, commanded by his brother Prince Maurice. In 1652 he was constituted sole admiral, and defeated the Dutch fleet commanded by Van Tromp, Ruyter, and de Witt in three several engagements, in which the Dutch lost eleven men of war, thirty merchant ships, and, according to their own account, had 1500 men slain. Soon after, Blake and Ins colleagues, with a fleet of a hundred sail, stood over to the Dutch coast, and forced the enemy’s fleet to fly for shelter into the Texel, where they were blockaded for some time by Monk and Dean, while Blake sailed northward. At last, however, Van Tromp got out, and drew together a fleet of a hundred and twenty men of war. On the 3d ot June the generals Dean and Monk came to an engagement with the enemy off the North Foreland, with indifleren success; but the next day Blake coming to their assistance with eighteen ships, gained so complete a victory, that ι the Dutch had not saved themselves on Calais sands, their whole fleet would have been taken or destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 1653 Cromwell turned the long parliament out of doors, and shortly afterwards assumed the supreme power. The states hoped great advantages from this, but they were disappointed. Blake observed to his officers on the occasion, “It is not for us to mind state affairs, but to keep foreigners from fooling us.” In November 1654, Cromwell sent him with a strong fleet into the Mediterranean, with orders to support the honour of the English flag, and to obtain satisfaction for certain injuries which had been done to our merchants. In the beginning of December, Blake entered the road of Cadiz, where he was treated with all imaginable respect; the Dutch admiral durst not hoist his flag while he was there; and his name had now become so formidable, that a French squadron having stopped one of his tenders, which had separated in a storm, the admiral, as soon as he knew to whom it belonged, sent for the captain on board, and drank Blake’s health with great ceremony, under a discharge of five guns, and then dismissed him. The Algerines were so much afraid of him, that, stopping the Sallee rovers, they obliged the latter to deliver up such English prisoners as they had on board, and then sent them freely to Blake, in order to purchase his favour. This, however, did not prevent his appearing on the 10th of March before Algiers, and sending an officer on shore to the dey to demand satisfaction for the piracies committed on the English, and the release of all the English captives. The dey, in his answer, alleged that the ships and captives belonged to private persons, and therefore he could not restore them without offending all his subjects, but that the English admiral might easily redeem them; and if he thought it proper, they would conclude a peace with him, and for the future commit no acts of hostility against the English. This answer was accompanied with a large present of fresh provisions; on receiving which Blake left Algiers, and sailed on the same errand to Tunis. The dey of the latter place, however, not only refused to comply with his request, but denied him the liberty of taking in fresh water. “Here,” said he, “are our castles of Goletto and Porto Ferino; do your worst.” On hearing this, Blake began, as his custom was when highly excited, to curl his whiskers; and, after a short consultation with his officers, resolved to bear into the bay of Porto Ferino with his great ships and their seconds. On coming within musketshot of the castle and the line, he fired on both so warmly, that in two hours the castle was rendered defenceless, and the guns on the works along the shore were dismounted, although sixty of them played at once on the English. Observing nine ships in the road, Blake ordered every captain to man his long boat with choice men, to enter the harbour and fire the Tunisians; a service which they happily effected, with the loss of only 25 men killed and 48 wounded, while the admiral covered the operation and took off the fire of the castle by playing continually on it with his great guns. This daring action spread the terror of his name throughout all Africa. From Tunis he sailed to Tripoli; caused the English slaves to be set at liberty; and concluded a peace with that government. He then returned to Tunis, upon which the Tunisians implored mercy, and begged him to grant them peace, which he did on terms highly advantageous to England. He next sailed to Malta, and obliged the knights to restore the effects taken by their privateers from the English. And by these, as well as other great exploits, he raised the glory of the English name to such a pitch, that most of the princes and states in Italy thought fit to pay their compliments to the protector, by sending solemn embassies to him.\n",
      "Blake passed the next winter either lying before Cadiz or cruizing up and down the straits. He was at his old station, at the mouth of the harbour, when he received information that the Spanish plate fleet had put into the bay of Santa Cruz, in the island of Teneriffe. Upon this he weighed anchor, with twenty-five men of war, on the 13th of April 1657; and on the 20th came to anchor with his ships off the bay of Santa Cruz, where he saw sixteen Spanish ships moored in the form of a half-moon. Near the mouth of the harbour stood a castle furnished with heavy ordnance; besides which there were seven forts round the bay, with six, four, and three guns on each, and connected by a line of communication manned with musketeers. To make all safe, the commander of the Spanish fleet caused all the smaller ships to be moored close in shore; while the six large galleons stood farther out at anchor, with their broadsides towards the sea. Blake having prepared for the fight, a squadron of ships was drawn out to make the first onset, commanded by Captain Stayner in the Speaker frigate; who, on receiving orders, sailed into the bay and fell upon the Spanish fleet, without the least regard to the forts, which kept up a heavy cannonade. As soon as these had entered the bay, Blake followed, and stationed several ships to pour their broadsides into the castle and forts; and these kept up so heavy and well-directed a fire, that, after some time, the Spaniards found their forts too hot to hold them. In the meanwhile Blake joined Stayner, and bravely fought the Spanish ships, out of which the crews were beaten by two o’clock in the afternoon; when Blake, finding it impossible to carry them away, ordered his men to set them on fire; and this was done so effectually, that they were all reduced to ashes except two, which sunk downright, nothing remaining above the water but part of the masts. The English having now obtained a complete victory, were reduced to another difficulty by the wind, which blew so strong into the bay that they despaired of getting out, and for a time lay under the fire of the castle and of all the forts, which must soon have torn them to pieces. But the wind suddenly shifting, they were enabled to work out of the bay, and left the Spaniards in astonishment at the fortunate temerity of their assailants. This action does honour to Blake; and although fortune favoured him in the opportune shifting of the wind, and his situation was, upon the whole, less trying than that of the gallant men under Lord Nelson, who, in our time, made an attempt on this place, his conduct throughout appears to have been distinguished for the most adventurous daring, and the most consummate nautical skill. “It was so miraculous,” says the Earl of Clarendon, “that all men who knew the place wondered that any sober man, with what courage soever endowed, would ever have undertaken it; and they could hardly persuade themselves to believe what they had done; whilst the Spaniards comforted themselves with the belief that they were devils, and not men, who had destroyed them in such a manner.”\n",
      "This was the last and greatest action of the gallant Blake. Consuming with dropsy and scurvy, he hastened home that he might yield up his last breath in the country which he had so much adorned by his valour; and just as he came within sight of land, he expired. Never man, zealous for the interest of a party, was so much respected and esteemed by his opponents. Disintereste\n",

      "the most celebrated physician of the eighteenth century, and one who without impropriety maybe opposed to the Galen of antiquity, if not in extent of genius, at least for the number and variety of his acquirements, the exclusive empire which his medical system obtained, and the immense celebrity which he enjoyed during his life. He was born in 1668, at Worhout, a village near Leyden. At the age of sixteen he found himself without parents, protection, advice, or fortune. He had already studied theology and the other ecclesiastical sciences, with the view of devoting himself to a clerical life; but the science of nature, which had equally occupied his mind, soon engrossed his whole attention. This illustrious person, whose name afterwards spread throughout the world, and who left at his death above L.200,000, could at that time barely live by his labours, and was compelled to teach mathematics in order to obtain the means of subsistence. But in 1693 he was received as doctor of physic, and began practice; and his merit having been discovered, many powerful friends patronized him, and procured him three valuable appointments; first, that of professor of medicine in the university of Leyden; secondly, that of professor of chemistry; and thirdly, that of professor of botany. The Academy of Sciences of Paris, and the Royal Society of London, each invited him to become one of their members; and he communicated to both his discoveries in chemistry. In Boerhaave’s time the city of Leyden became the school of Europe for this science, as well as for medicine and botany. All the princes of Europe sent him disciples, who found in this skilful professor not only an indefatigable teacher, but an affectionate guardian, who encouraged them to pursue their labours, consoled them in their afflictions, and solaced them in their wants. When Peter the Great went to Holland in 1715, to instruct himself in maritime affairs, he also attended Boerhaave in order to receive lessons. The reputation of the latter extended as far as China: a mandarin wrote to him a letter superscribed with this direction, “To the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe and it reached him in due course. The city of Leyden has raised a monument in the church of St Peter, to the salutary genius of Boerhaave, Salutifero Boerhaavii genio sacrum.\n",
      "From the time of Hippocrates, no physician had more justly merited the esteem of his contemporaries, and the thanks of posterity, than Boerhaave. To an uncommon genius and extraordinary talents he united those qualities of the heart which give them so great a value to society. His appearance was decent, simple, venerable, and, latterly, almost patriarchal. He was an eloquent orator, and discoursed with dignity and grace. He taught very methodically, and with great precision; he never tired his auditors, who always regretted when his discourses were finished. He would sometimes also give them a lively turn; but his raillery was refined and ingenious, and it enlivened the subject he treated of, without carrying with it any thing severe or satirical. A declared foe to all excess, he considered decent mirth as the salt of life. It was the daily practice of this eminent person, throughout his life, as soon as he rose in the morning, which was generally very early, to retire for an hour to private prayer, and meditation on some part of the Scriptures. He often told his friends, when they asked him how it was possible for him to go through so much fatigue, that it was this practice which gave him spirit and vigour in the business of the day. He therefore recommended it as the best rule he could give; for nothing, said he, can tend more to the health of the body than the tranquillity of the mind.\n",
      "Of his sagacity, and the wonderful penetration with which he often discovered and described, at first sight, such distempers as betray themselves by no symptoms to common eyes, very surprising accounts have been transmitted to us. Yet this great master of medical knowledge was so far from having presumptuous confidence in his own abilities, or from being puffed up by riches, that he was condescending to all, and remarkably diligent in his profession; and he used often to observe that the life of a patient, if trifled with or neglected, would one day be required at the hand of the physician. The activity of his mind sparkled visibly in his eyes. He was always cheerful, and desirous of promoting every valuable end of conversation, of which the excellency of the Christian religion was frequently the subject; for he asserted, on all proper occasions, the divine authority and sacred efficacy of the Scriptures. He never regarded calumny nor detraction,—for even Boerhaave himself had enemies,—nor in any instance thought it necessary to confute them. “They are sparks,” said he, “which, if you do not blow them, will go out of themselves. The surest remedy against scandal, is to live it down by a perseverance in well-doing; and by praying to God that he would cure the distempered minds of those who traduce and injure us.” Being once asked by a friend, who had often admired his patience under great provocations, whether he knew what it was to be angry, and by what means he had so entirely suppressed that impetuous and ungovernable passion, he answered, with the utmost frankness and sincerity, that he was naturally quick of resentment; but that, by daily prayer and meditation, he had at length attained to this mastery over himself.\n",
      "About the middle of the year 1737 he felt the first approaches of that fatal illness which brought him to the grave; namely, a disorder in the chest, which was at times very painful, often threatening him with immediate suffocation, and which terminated in an universal dropsy. But during this afflictive and lingering illness, his constancy and firmness did not forsake him; he neither intermitted the necessary cares of life, nor forgot the proper preparations for death. About three weeks before his dissolution, when the Rev. Mr Schultens, one of the most learned and exemplary divines of the age, attended him at his countryhouse, the doctor desired his prayers, and afterwards entered into a most remarkably judicious discourse with him on the spiritual and immaterial nature of the soul; and this he illustrated to Mr Schultens with wonderful perspicuity, by a description of the effects which the infirmities of his body had upon his faculties; which, however, they did not so oppress or vanquish as to deprive his mind of the mastery over itself. As death approached nearer, he was so far from terror or confusion, that he seemed less sensible of pain, and more cheerful under his sufferings, which continued till the 23d day of September 1738, when he died, between four and five in the morning, in the seventieth year of his age; often recommending to the byestanders a careful observation of St John’s precepts concerning the love of God and the love of man, as frequently inculcated in his first epistle, particularly in the fifth chapter. His funeral oration was spoken in Latin before the university of Leyden, to a very numerous audience, by Mr Schultens, and afterwards published at their particular desire.\n",
      "When Boerhaave first directed his attention to medicine, the new philosophy of Bacon, and the creation of the experimental art, had caused the physical sciences to make great advancement; and these, accordingly, occupied all minds, whilst the healing art had but little profited in consequence. It was overlooked or forgotten, that, from its very origin, Hippocrates had applied to it the very philosophy with which the learned were now everywhere so enthusiastically occupied. His theory, however, still continued to fluctuate between several dogmas equally remote from the truth. The chemists who, at the revival of learning in Europe, had overturned the authority of Galen, had to defend themselves against the sects of the mechanicians, and of Bellini, which divided the dominion of medicine between them. In a small portion of Germany alone Stahl brought back men’s minds to the judicious doctrine of Hippocrates, attributing all the movements in the animal economy to a force inherent in itself, and different from the general forces of matter; but in adopting a word, the meaning of which was by no means precise, he rendered less general and less salutary the influence which he would otherwise have produced. The first perusal of Hippocrates appeared to have carried away Boerhaave; but this physician, endowed by nature with a mind fitted for analysis, comparison, and combination, rather than with a creative and inventive genius, was unable to resist the influence of his age, and, above all, the effect of his early studies. Having been a mathematician and natural philosopher before he became physician, he was constantly carried away by the first objects of his labour and research; and being more capable than any one else of detecting the accessory affinities between these sciences and that of man, he ran greater risk of being seduced by them. But as every system, however vicious, has always, along with the facts which it arranges and offers to explain, a point of accordance more or less remote, he thought that the best medical system would be that which should unite and combine all opinions. Forgetting that living bodies are free, during their life, from those movements to which other bodies are imperiously constrained, or at least counterbalance them, and that all the acts which they perform are the result of an activity which is peculiar to them; overlooking, also, that those of the movements of the living economy which most easily admit an application of the laws of physics and mechanics, have, nevertheless, as a primum mobile, the force of life, and only receive from the forces of dead matter an accessory impulse; Boerhaave wished to combine in one and the same theory the vital philosophy of Hippocrates, the chemical principles of Sy\n",

      "the general name of almost every literary composition, but, in a more limited sense, applied only to such compositions as are large enough to make a volume.\n",
      "Several sorts of materials were formerly used in making books. Plates of lead and copper, the bark of trees, bricks, stone, and wood, were the substances anciently employed to engrave such things upon as men were willing to have transmitted to posterity. Josephus speaks of two columns, the one of stone and the other of brick, on which the children of Seth wrote their inventions and astronomical discoveries; and Porphyry mentions some pillars preserved in Crete, on which the ceremonies observed by the Corybantes in their sacrifices were recorded. Hesiod’s works were originally written upon tablets of lead, and deposited in the temple of the Muses, in Boeotia; the ten commandments delivered to Moses were written upon stone; and the laws of Solon were inscribed upon wooden planks. Tables of wood, box, and ivory, were common among the ancients; but when of wood, they were latterly covered with wax, and the letters traced in the soft matter of the coating by means of a pointed style, so that writing in this fashion might be exactly executed, and as easily obliterated. The leaves of the palm-tree were afterwards used instead of wooden planks; and also the finest and thinnest part of the bark of such trees as the lime, the ash, the maple, and the elm; whence comes the word libeτ i which literally signifies the inner bark of a tree. And as these barks were rolled up, in order to be removed with greater ease, the rolls were called volumxη, a volume; a name afterwards given to the like rolls of paper or parchment.\n",
      "Thus we find books were first written on stones, as the decalogue of Moses; then on the parts of plants, as leaves, chiefly of the palm-tree, the rind and barks, especially of the tilia, or phillyrea, and the Egyptian papyrus. By degrees wax came to be used; then leather, especially the skins of goats and sheep, of which at length parchment was prepared; then lead was employed; then linen, silk, and horn; and lastly paper itself.\n",
      "The first books were in the form of blocks and tablets; but when flexible matter camc into use it was found more convenient to make books in the form of rolls, which were composed of several sheets fastened to each other, and rolled upon a stick, or umbilicus; the whole forming a kind of column or cylinder, which was managed by the umbilicus as a handle. The outside of the volume was called frons, and the ends of the umbilicus cornua; which were usually carved, and adorned with silver, ivory, or even gold and precious stones. The title, c , υλλα⅛os, was struck on the outside; and the whole volume, when extended, might be about a yard or more in width, and fifty in length. The form which obtains among us is the square, composed of separate leaves; and it was also known, though little used, by the ancients.\n",
      "To the form of books belongs also the internal economy, embracing the order and arrangement of points and letters into lines and pages, with margins and other accessories. This has undergone many varieties. At first the letters were divided only into lines; then into separate words; and these, by degrees, were noted with accents, and distributed, by points and stops, into periods, paragraphs, chapters, and other divisions. In some countries, as among the orientals, the direction of the lines was from right to left; in others, as among the northern and western nations, from left to right; while the early Greeks followed both directions, writing alternately from right to left and from left to right, which was called boustrophedon, from its analogy to the path of oxen in ploughing. In most countries the lines run from one side to the other; in some, particularly among the Chinese, their direction is from top to bottom. The Egyptian monumental writing, or hieroglyphics, is arranged in all these directions, and in several peculiar to itself. Sometimes we find it proceeding from right to left; sometimes from left to right; very frequently from top to bottom, in regular parallel columns; in a few instances, and but a few, boustrophedon; occasionally arranged in groups or clusters, as in anaglyphs; and, where the space was irregular, as on the sides of obelisks, disposed in an arbitrary manner, varying according to the circumstances. But this total Avant of system, or rather this mode of arranging the characters upon all systems and in all ways, can never be productive of any difficulty or ambiguity, as the disposition and true sequence of the writing is in every case clearly and almost intuitively indicated by the direction given to the principal figures, more especially to those which represent animals, or the human form. W τ ith regard to the other modes of writing practised by the ancient Egyptians, that called the hieratic follows to a certain extent the varieties of the hieroglyphic; but the demotic, enchorial, or civil form, is generally disposed from right to left, in the ordinary manner of oriental writing.\n",
      "Of the scarcity and value of books during the seventh and subsequent centuries, the following curious account is given by Mr Warton :—\n",
      "“1owards the close of the seventh century,” says this writer, “even in the papal library at Rome, the number of books was so inconsiderable, that Pope Saint Martin requested Sanctamund, bishop of Maestricht, if possible, to supply this defect from the remotest parts of Germany. In the year 855 Lupus, abbot of Ferrières, in France, sent two of his monks to Pope Benedict III. to beg a copy of Cicero de Oratore, and Quintilian’s Institutes, and some other books: i for, says the abbot, ζ although we have part of these books, yet there is no whole or complete copy of them in all France.’ Albert, abbot of Gemblours,' who with incredible labour and immense expense had collected a hundred volumes on theological, and fifty on profane subjects, imagined he had formed a splendid library. About the year 790 Charlemagne granted an unlimited right of hunting to the abbot and monks of Sithin, for making their gloves and girdles of the skins of the deer they killed, and covers for their books. We may imagine that these religious were more fond of hunting than reading. It is certain that they were obliged to hunt before they could read; and at least it is probable that, under these circumstances, and of such materials, they did not manufacture many volumes. At the beginning of the tenth century books were so scarce in Spain, that one and the same copy of the bible, Saint Jerome’s Epistles, and some volumes of ecclesiastical offices and martyrologies, often served several different monasteries. Among the constitutions given to the monks of England by Archbishop Lanfranc, in the year 1072, the following injunction occurs. At the beginning of Lent the librarian is ordered to deliver a book to each of the religious: a whole year was allowed for the perusal of this book, and at the returning Lent those monks who had neglected to read the books they had respectively received are commanded to prostrate themselves before the abbot, and to supplicate his indulgence. This regulation was partly occasioned by the low state of literature which Lanťranc found in the English monasteries. But at the same time it was a matter of necessity, and is in a great measure to be referred to the scarcity of copies of useful and suitable authors. In an inventory of the goods of John de Pontissara, bishop of Winchester, contained in his capital palace of Wulvesey, all the books which appear are nothing more than Septendecim sp>ecies librorum de diversis scientiis. This Avas in the year 1294. The same prelate, in the year 1299, borrows of his cathedral convent of St SAvithin at Winchester, Bibliam bene glossatam; that is, the bible Avith marginal annotations, in two large folio volumes; but gives a bond for due return of the loan, drawn up with great solemnity. This bible had been bequeathed to the convent the same year by Pontissara’s predecessor, Bishop Nicholas de Ely; and in consideration of so important a bequest, that is, pro bona Bibliα dicti episcopi bene glossata, and one hundred merks in money, the monks founded a daily mass for the soul of the donor. When a single book Avas bequeathed to a friend or relation, it was seldom Avithout many restrictions and stipulations. If any person gave a book to a religious house, he believed that so valuable a donation merited eternal salvation; and he offered it on the altar Avith great ceremony. The most formidable anathemas Avere peremptorily denounced against those av1io should dare to alienate a book presented to the cloister or library of a religious house. The prior and convent of Rochester declare that they will every year pronounce the irrevocable sentence of damnation on him who shall purloin or conceal a Latin translation of Aristotle’s Physics, or even obliterate the title. Sometimes a book Avas given to a monastery on condition that the donor should have the use of it during his life; and sometimes to a private person, with the reservation that he who receives it should pray for the soul of his benefactor. The gift of a book to Lincoln Cathedral by Bishop Repingdon, in the year 1422, occurs in this form, and under these curious circumstances. The memorial is written in Latin with the bishop’s own hand, which I Avill give in English, at the beginning of Peter’s Breviary of the Bible. ‘ I Philip of Repyndon, late bishop of Lincoln, give this book, called Peter de Areolis, to the new library to be built within the church of Lincoln; reserving the use and possession of it to Richard Trysely, clerk, canon, and prebendary, of Miltoun, in fee, and to the term of his life; and afterwards to be given up and restored to the said library, or the keepers of the same, for the time being, faithfully, and without delay. Written with my own hand, a. d. 1422.’ When a book was bought, the affair w\n",

      "a mathematician and nautical astronomer, celebrated for his improvements in the theory of hydraulics and pneumatics, and in the construction of instruments for observation. He was born at Drax, on the 4th of May 1733, and was originally destined for the bar; but abandoned the pursuit of the law in favour of a military life, which he considered as better calculated to afford him opportunities for the cultivation of his mathematical talents, and for the application of the results of his studies to practice. His acquirements in science had very early attracted the attention of D’Alembert, who predicted his future eminence, and warmly recommended his turning his thoughts to the occupation of a place in the academy. He obtained a commission in the light cavalry, and was appointed teacher of mathematics to the corps; and, in 1756, he presented to the Academy of Sciences (A) A Memoir on the Paths of Bombs, which was ordered to be printed in the collection of the Savans Etrangers, but which has not excited much attention. He was elected in the same year a member of the academy; and in the next he was present at the battle of Hastinbeck, in the capacity of aid-de-camp to the celebrated General\n",
      "Maĩllebois, to whom he looked up as a great master in the art of war.\n",
      "He was afterwards admitted into the corps of engineers, without the usual form of examination into his qualifications; and being stationed at a sea-port, the occurrences of the place naturally directed his attention anew to the phenomena of the resistance of fluids. He published, in 1763, a detailed memoir on this subject (B. Mem. Ac. Par. 1763, p. 358), in which he relates a variety of experiments, showing that the resistance of the air is actually proportional to the square of the velocity, as had commonly been supposed from theoretical considerations. He also determines, by other experiments, the magnitude of the resistance to the motion of a sphere, and proves that nothing can be more erroneous than the supposition that the resistance to an oblique surface decreases as the square of the sine of the angle of incidence. He also finds, that the resistance to the motion of a cube, in the directions of the diagonal of its base and of one of the sides, are as 21 to 16, while the calculations of former theorists had made the resistance greatest in the direction of the side.\n",
      "In 1766 he published an Essay on the discharge of fluids through the orifices of vessels (C. Mem. Ac. Par. 1766, p. 579), in which he first states the objections to considering the different strata of a fluid as descending in all cases very nearly in parallel directions; he examines the contraction of the jet after its escape from the orifice, and determines some of the effects of abrupt changes in the velocity of the fluid passing through pipes or apertures of different forms.\n",
      "He contributed, in 1767, to the publications of the academy, an important Memoir on Water Wheels (D. p. 270), which has escaped the notice of his able biographer Μ. Lacroix. He observes, in this paper, that the simple hypothesis of a resistance varying as the square of the velocity, which is so near the truth in common cases, where a number of particles, proportional to the velocity, strikes, in a given time, upon a small exposed surface with a force also proportional to the velocity, is totally inapplicable to the action of a confined stream upon the floatboards of a wheel, since in this instance, the number of particles concerned cannot vary materially with the velocity, the whole stream being supposed to operate in all cases upon the successive floatboards; so that the analogy would require us to suppose the force in this case nearly proportional to the simple relative velocity; a conclusion whiclι agrees remarkably well with the experiments of some practical authors.\n",
      "The same volume contains a continuation of Μ. Borda’s researches relating to the resistance of oblique surfaces (E. Mem. Ac. Par. 1767, p. 495), with a statement of experiments still more conclusively confuting the received hypothesis respecting oblique impulse than his former investigations had done. We also find in it an Essay on isoperimetrical problems (F. p. 551), in which it is shown that Euler’s method of treating them, which had been in great measure abandoned by its equally profound and candid author, in favour of the more general and more elegant calculations of Lagrange, was still capable of affording all the results that had been derived from the method of variations; and he even pointed out some deficiencies in the first memoir of Lagrange, which contained the detail of his ingenious invention. These investigations of Μ. Borda afford collateral evidence of the strict truth of the demonstrations of both his great predecessors; and though they have been little employed by later mathematicians, yet it must be admitted to be of some importance, in enabling us to appreciate the value of a new mode of calculation, to determine whether its results are or are not such as might be obtained with almost equal convenience by methods before in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "His memoir, inserted in the collection of the Academy for 1768 (G. Mem. Ac. Par. 1768, p. 18), is devoted exclusively to the theory of pumps; and he considers especially the effect of the passage of the fluid through valves and other contracted parts in diminishing the quantity of the discharge. His results are derived from the principle of the preservation of the living force or energy of a system of bodies, throughout all the vicissitudes of its motions, which had before been employed with success by Daniel Bernoulli in problems of a similar nature; but it was not until the experiments of Buat had afforded sufficient grounds for the determination of the friction of fluids, that cases of this kind could be submitted to exact calculation.\n",
      "In his Essay on the curve described by cannon-balls, published among the Memoirs for 1769 (H. Mem. Ac. Par. 1769, p. 247), he has greatly simplified the practical theory of projectiles, which had been treated in a satisfactory though very general manner by John Bernoulli, and had been reduced into a much more convenient form by Euler. Μ. Borda has substituted some approximate expressions for the true value of the density of the air, and has thus been enabled to integrate equations which, in their more strictly correct form, had resisted the powers of Euler himself; and he has justified the adoption of the formulas thus obtained by a comparison with experiment.\n",
      "In the mean time his talents were very actively employed in the naval service of his country, which he entered in 1767, by the nomination of Μ. Praslin. The time-keepers of Le Roy and Berthoud were beginning to rival those of the English artists, and the French government ordered several vessels to be fitted out for cruises, in order to examine the accuracy of these time-keepers. Μ. Borda was appointed a lieutenant on board of the Florc, and acted jointly with Μ. Pingré as a delegate of the Academy of Sciences for the purposes of the expedition. The voyage occupied about a year, and extended to the Canaries, the West Indies, Newfoundland, Iceland, and Denmark. Μ. Borda had a considerable share in the account which was published of the observations; and the formula which he has here given for the correction of the effects of refraction and parallax is considered as equally elegant and convenient. He also presented to the academy a separate memoir on the results of the expedition. (I. Voyage pour éprouver les Montres de Le Poy. 4. Paris. K. Mem. Ac. Par. 1773, p. 258.) After an interval of six weeks, these watches were found capable of determining the longitude within about fifteen minutes of the truth.\n",
      "In order to supply some deficiencies in the observations made at the Canaries, Borda was sent out a second time, with the Boussole and the Espiègle; and he published, after his return (L.), a very correct and highly finished map of these islands. He was soon afterwards promoted to the rank of captain, and served under the Count d’Estaing as a major-general, an appointment nearly similar to that of our captains of the fleet. In this capacity he observed the inconvenience of too great a variety in the sizes of the vessels constituting a fleet, and proposed to abolish the class of fifty and of sixty-four gun ships, as too small for the line of battle, and to build ships of three rates only, the lowest carrying seventy-four guns, so that a smaller quantity of stores should require to be kept ready for use in the dock-yards, than when ships of more various dimensions were to be refitted. In 1780 he had the command of the Guerrier, and in 1781 of the Solitaire, which was taken after a gallant resistance by an English squadron. He was thus compelled to pay a visit to Great Britain, but was immediately set at liberty upon his parole.\n",
      "He proposed to the academy in this year (Μ. Mem. Ac. Par. 1781), a mode of regulating elections, which was adopted by that body. Its peculiarity consisted in having the names of the candidates arranged by each voter in a certain order, and collecting the numbers expressing the degrees of preference into separate results, so that the simple majority of voters did not necessarily establish the claim of any individual, if he was placed very low in the list by any considerable number of those who voted against him. But it must be allowed that this mode of election is by no means wholly unobjectionable.\n",
      "Μ. Borda appears to have rendered an essential service to the cultivators o*f practical astronomy by the introduction and improvement of the repeating circle, although this instrument has probably been less employed in Great Britain than elsewhere, on account of the greater perfection of those which were previously in common use. It had been suggested by Mayer in 1767, that a circle with two movable sights would enable us to observe a given angle a great number of times in succession, and to add together \n",

      "a vast region of North America, nearly of a triangular shape, extending from the fiftieth to the sixty-first degree of north latitude, and from fifty-six to seventyeight of west longitude. It is bounded ön the south by Canada and the Gulf of St Lawrence, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by Hudson’s Straits, and on the west by Hudson’s Bay. Being thus detached from the arctic lands, Labrador ought to partake in some degree of the nature of the temperate cold regions; but, from causes which do not appear to be very obvious, it is a country as frozen, desolate, and barren, as those to the west of Hudson’s Bay. The coast along that spacious inland sea is called East Main, and the climate there is peculiarly rigorous. The whole surface of Labrador, indeed, is as sterile and naked as any part of the globe. The prevailing features are rocks, swamps, and water; and vegetation appears as the last effort of expiring naturel Small scraggy poplars, stunted firs, creeping birch, and dwarf willows, thinly scattered in the southern parts, constitute the whole of the trees; herbs and grass are also in sheltered places to be met with; but in the most northerly parts only varieties of moss and lichens are to be found. The whole of the interior, from the aspect of what has been explored, and from the reports of the Esquimaux and other Indians, seems to be broken up with rivers, lakes, and rocks. The geological features of the Labrador coast are as follow:^[1. For this account of the geology of Labrador, we are indebted to ä paper by Captain II. Robinśon, R. N. published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London, 1834.λ l m ülH J j . i , ∙ * i ] —The prevailing rock contiguous to the sea shore is gneiss. On this, at L’Anse à Loup, the most fertile part of the country, a bed of old red sandstone, about two hundred feet thick, is superimposed, and extends about half a mile inland. Here also, as on every other part of the coast visited by the individual from whom our information is derived, the appearances of the cliffs and of the land near them, and the rolled masses inland, which have evidently been exposed to the action of the sea, seem to prove that the latter has considerably receded. The sandstone is generally red and white in alternate strips, and presents a remarkable mural front to the sea. Near the surface it was strongly marked with iron. The whole of the rock was composed of white quartz and yellow felspar'; and the grains were generally as fine as oatmeal, though occasionally coarser, even to the extent of half an inch in diameter. Over the red sandstone was a thin stratum of red compact felspar, containing vegetable impressions, and also horizontal. Above this were varieties of secondary limestone arranged in parallel strata several’ feet thick and full of shells. Detached masses of primitive limestone were also found; and, a few miles from the shore, the secondary formations generally disappeared, leaving gneiss and mica slate on the surface. North of Cape Charles, on the Labrador coast, the land falls back to the westward, and the shore changes its character, becoming shoal, and running off in flats; whereas to the southward it is bold and abrupt. The prevailing rock, however, is still gneiss, containing numerous veins of granite, from a few inches to many feet in thickness, the constitüent parts being mica, quartz, and felspar. The diameter and dip of the gneiss rock is here, as elsewhere on the coast, to the northwest, and at an angle of nearly 65°. It is coarse and dark, hornblende taking the place of mica, and frequently very light-grayish felspar forming the chief constituent. Where this occurs, the face of the hill has a remarkably spotted appearance. On one of the islands which here skirt the coast, a large bed of primitive greenstone was found, forming a range of hills resting on the gneiss, and appearing to have the same direction. On the western part of these islands also the gneiss gives place to mica slate, this commencing beyond the above-mentioned range of greenstone, which appears to mark the line of demarcation between them. The mica slate then predominates through all the islands and shores examined to the westward of this point, viz. to the Mealy Mountains, in Sandwich Bay, a distance of about thirty-five miles. In some places crystals of garnet are very abundant in it, and in others considerable beds of granite were found, of a confused appearance, and in which quartz and felspar predominated. The Mealy Mountains are the highest land on this coast, and were computed to be about 1484 feet in height, covered nearly to the top with wood, notwithstanding the severity of the climate. They are of mica slate, with a dark, finegrained formation of the same, resembling basalt, at their base. The general rock is coarse-grained. At the foot of these mountains were also found beds ’eight and ten feet thick, and large.rolled masses of a remarkable conglomerate rock, of which the basis was composed of grains of mica, quartz, and felspar; and the imbedded masses were large rounded pebbles of quartz, mica slaté, felspar, hornblende, granite, and grieiss. The whole was very hard, and elicited sparks of fire nndér the stroke of the hammer. The imbedded fragn⅛ents were all water-worn.\n",
      "The general aspect of different parts of the Labrador coast has been described by the Moravian missionaries, from whom we learn that NullatarIok Bay, iń 59° north latitude, is surrounded by high mountains, which are covered with moss, alder, birch, and various shrubs and plants, the valleys in July being grassy and enamelled with a great variety of flowers. The rocks are slaty, easily splitting into plates of from four to eight feet square. At Nachvâk Bay the sea was clear oficė in the middle of July, and the magnificent mountains around afforded to the missionaries a most enchanting prospect. Oppernavik, lying between the sixtieth and sixty-first degrees of north latitude, iš not far distant from Cape Chudleigh, where the coast, which was hitherto north, now trends to the south-south-west, embosoming a‘ spacious expanse of water called Ungava Bay. The river Kàn-gertluksoak, in latitude 58. 57. north, is about 140 miles south-south-west of Cape Chuđleigb. The i estuary of the Koksoak lies in 58. 36. north latitude, at the distance of about 650 miles from the Moravian station Okk i ak, and is as broad as the Thames at Gravesend. Up the river there is a bay surrounded on all sides by gently rising ground, well wooded with trees of moderate size. 1 For about half a mile a fine slope extends, bounded on each extremity by a hill. The Moravians describe the land as level and dry, watered by rivulets issuing from the woods, in which were found various European plants and flowers, different kinds of shrubs, such as junipers, currants, and the like, and grass and trees in abundance. The missionaries were informed that, further west, no wood grows along the coast. The soil at L’Anse à Loup is rich, and it is much the most eligible part of Labrador for settlers. Corn will not ripen, but serves for green food; and potatoes, cabbages, lettuce, spinach, and early Dutch turnips, do well. There is generally much rain on the whole coast, but now the temperature would appear to be more equable than it was some fifty years ago, if we may trust to the correctness of the reports of navigators. The current always sets to the southward along the coast. The tides rise six feet to the northward, and about four to the southward. The prevailing winds are from west-south-west to north-west. There is less fog than farther south; and the Straits of Belleisle, which separate Newfoundland from Labrador and thb continent of America, are never frozen over.\n",
      "On the coast of Labrador the winter is extremely severe, the thermometer often falling thirty degrees below the freezing point; and although the houses of the Moravian missionaries are heated by large cast-iron stoves, the windows and walls are all the winter covered with ice, and the bed-clothes freeze to the walls. Rum is frozen in the air as rapidly as water, and rectified spirits soon become thick like oil. From December to June the sea is completely frozen over; and so intense is the cold during the winter months, that travelling is sometimes attended with the most painful consequences. The summer months, again, are extremelyhot along the coast, the thermometer rising to eighty-six degrees of Fahrenheit, when swarms of musquitoes infest the air. The climate, however, is not insalubrious; and, notwithstanding all its disadvantages, Labrador is of considerable importance to Great Britain. No country is better provided with large, convenient, and safe harbours, or supplied with better water; and vast multitudes of all those kinds of fish common to the arctic seas abound on the coast. Herrings are very fine and plentiful in August, but there is no weather to cure any kind of fish after the 10th of September. The rivers are frequented by salmon and sea trout; and pike, barbel, eels, river trout, and the like, are likewise found in them. On the numerous islands which are scattered along the east coast, multitudes of eider-ducks and other water-fowl breed. Those of large size have deer, foxes, and hares, upon them. On the continent the wild animals are principally bears, wolves, foxes, and otters; beavers and deer are not numerous, but their furs are remarkably close and beautiful. The birds of the country are the white-tailed eagle, falcons, hawks, and owls of various kinds; raven, white grouse, ptarmigan, spruce-game, whistling curlew, gray plover, various kinds of sand-pipers and other waders; geese, ducks of various sorts, shags, gulls, divers, and some few species of small birds. During the short summer, insects are very numerous, especially in swampy places. In winter they exist in a state of torpidity, from which they are aroused by the solar heat or artificial warmth.

      "from lacinia, the guard hem or fringe of a garment, is a plain or ornamented network, consisting of threads of gold, silver, silk, flax, or cotton, tastefully interwoven so as to form a beautiful texture. This delicate fabric has no doubt claims to high antiquity, but its origin is involved in considerable obscurity. That it was worn by Grecian females is certain, and the derivation of the word lace affords presumptive evidence that it was also in use amongst the Romans. In Venice, and the neighbouring states of Italy, it was very early worn; and Mary of Medicis is supposed to have been the first who introduced its use into France; but as early as 1483 we find it included in a list of articles prohibited to be imported into England. The inference which maybe drawn from this circumstance is, that it had begun to be made in this country prior to the period above mentioned, and that this prohibition, like many other subsequent acts, was for the protection and encouragement of home manufactures. Butins, which are indispensable in the process of lace-making, were not known till long afterwards; so that it is probable the fabric made was neither very fine in texture, nor produced to any great extent. It is uncertain by whom the manufacture of lace was originally introduced into this country, nor is it of great importance to know. About themiddle of the seventeenth century, the lace trade was a flourishing concern in Buckinghamshire; and so greatly had it advanced in England, that, by a royal ordonnance in France, passed in 1660, a mark was established upon the thread lace imported from this country and from Flanders, and upon point-lace from Genoa, Venice, and other countries.\n",
      "Pillow-lace, the original manufacture, is worked upon a hard-stuffed pillow, with silk, flax, or cotton threads, according to a parchment pattern placed upon it, by means of pins, bobbins, and spindles, which are placed and displaced, twisting and interweaving the threads, so as to imitate the pattern designed. This manufacture has been long pursued in many counties in England, and at various places on the Continent. Of the number of persons employed on the Continent no estimate can be formed; but at Brussels alone no less than 10,000 individuals are said to be engaged in the manufacture. It is supposed that the first lace ever made in this country was that called Brussels point, in which the network is \"made by bone bobbins on the pillow, and the pattern and sprigs are worked with the needle. This, from different portraits now in existence, appears to have been the kind worn in the time of Charles I. and during the reigns of several subsequent sovereigns. Various improvements have from time to time taken place in the manufacture of this article; but, about the year 1778, the point-ground was introduced by the inhabitants of Buckingham and its neighbourhood, which quickly superseded all the others. The origin of the modern pillow-lace may be dated from this period; but the most striking improvements did not take place till the commencement of the present century, and since then, for several years, they were astonishing and unprecedented. - During the war, veils of this lace sold at a very high rate; but their value has been greatly depreciated by the introduction of the new manufacture, which is the product of machinery. Since 1815, the competition in this article has been very great, and the manufacture of pillow-lace has consequently declined so much as to be now in a very languishing condition.\n",
      "The first who made lace by machinery was a framework knitter of Nottingham, about the year 1768. This individual employed his common stocking-frame in the manufacture; but, about the same time, another person in the same place introduced a machine ostensibly for lace, called a pin-machine. Single-press point-net, in imitation of the Brussels ground, was the article produced. In 1782 the warp-frame was introduced, and is still in use for making warp-lace. In 1809, Mr Heathcoat of Tiverton succeeded in discovering the correct principle of the bobbin-net frame, and obtained a patent for fourteen years for his invention. The expiration of this patent, combined with the application of steam-power, which had now become general, gave a great stimulus to the trade. The demand became immense, arid prices fell in proportion as production increased. The Nottingham lace-frame became the organ of general supply, rivalling and supplanting in plain nets the most finished productions of France and the Netherlands. In a work relative to this manufacture, published in 1833, the state of the trade is given as follows:\n",
      "Total capital employed in the trade L.1,932,000\n",
      "Total number of hands employed 159,300\n",
      "The annual produce in 1831 was estimated at 23,400,000 square yards, worth L. 1,891,875. In 1834, above 7,000,000 square yards more were annually produced, an increase which is understood to have arisen from the new and improved machinery introduced into the manufacture. A considerable increase has also taken place in bobbin-net machinery on the Continent, particularly at Calais, where, in 1823, there were not thirty-five machines, and probably not one hundred on the Continent altogether. According to the authority above mentioned, there are now above 700 machines at Calais alone; and the total number on the Continent has been estimated at 1850. The produce of these machines has been calculated at 9,824,000 square yards of net, of the value of L.570,250. The manufacture is now'beginning to be established in different parts of Europe, where it has hitherto been unknown; and even from some places in Persia orders have been received in this country for bobbin-net frames; but government has restricted the exportation of machinery. The English manufacture from machinery is now confined to point-net, warp-net, and bobbin-net, so called from the peculiar construction of the machines by which they are produced. There were various other descriptions made, but they are now discontinued. Nottingham is the depot of the lace trade; and the supplies collected from all the surrounding villages, and even from the more distant counties where it is manufactured, are thence distributed to various quarters of the world. The Nottingham trade is by no means in so prosperous a condition as it once was; a result which may probably be attributed to the great influx of capital and hands into the trade, which a successful novelty is at all times calculated to attract. An extraordinary increase in the powers of production followed; and as the demand for some time kept pace with the supply, the latter became a question of quantity rather than of quality, and a great depression of price was the consequence, l· rom becoming cheap and common, lace lost its attractions in the fashionable circles, and has to a considerable extent been superseded by other kinds of manufacture. The natural result of the increase in power machinery, and the application of speedier machines, is to depress the condition of the workmen, and for some time they have suffered much; nor is any immediate amelioration likely to take place. The following observations on the importance of the trade to Britain are extracted from M t Culloch ’ s Dictionary of Commerce : “By comparing the value of 1,270,000 lbs. of Sea Island cotton, worth L.148,000, and about L.10,000 worth of thrown silk, which appears to be annually used in this manufacture, with the manufactured value of the same, worked into 30,771,000 square yards of bobbin-net, the estimated value of which is L.1,850,650, the great national utility of this trade becomes at once evident. A clear surplus of more than a pound sterling is realized upon every pound avoirdupois of the raw material, which is distributed over the trade in rent, profit, and wages; and this is altogether independent of the profits arising from embroidering, in itself a most extensive and important branch. About half, or perhaps three fourths, of this production is supposed to be exported in a plain state, chiefly to Hamburg, the Leipsic and Frankfort fairs, Antwerp and the rest of Belgium, to France (contraband), Italy, Sicily, and North and South America. Of the remainder, three fourths are sold unembroidered, and the remaining fourth embroidered, in this country.”\n",
      "“The most celebrated laces are,—1. Brussels, the most valuable. There are two kinds: Brussels ground, having a hexagon mesh, formed by platting and twisting four threads of flax to a perpendicular line of mesh: Brussels wire ground, made of silk; meshes partly straight and partly arched. The pattern is worked separately, and set on by the needle. 2. Mechlin: a hexagon mesh, formed of three flax threads twisted and platted to a perpendicular line or pillar. The pattern is worked in the net. 3. Valenciennes: an irregular hexagonal, formed of two threads, partly twisted and platted at the top of the mesh. The pattern is worked in the net similar to Mechlin lace. 4. Lisle: a diamond mesh, formed of two threads platted to a pillar. 5. Alençon, called blond: hexagon, of two threads, twisted similar to Buckingham lace; considered the most inferior of any made on the cushion. 6. Alençon point: formed of two threads to a pillar, with octagon and square meshes alternately.\n",
      "“The French nets made by machinery are,—1. Singlepress point, called, when not ornamented, tulle, and when ornamented, dentelle, made of silk; is an inferior net, but is attractive, from the beautiful manner in which it is stiffened: 2. Trico Berlin; so called from being invented at Berlin, and the stitch being removed three needles from its place of looping; is fanciful and ornamented in appearance, but not in demand in England: 3. Fleur de Tulle, made from the warp-lace machine; mesh of two descriptions, which gives a shaded appearance to the net: 4. Tulle Anglais is double-pressed point-lace: 5. and 6.

      "an extensive accumulation of water, wholly surrounded by land, and having no direct nor immediate communication with the ocean or with any seas, or having so only by means of rivers. Lakes are of various kinds, and have been divided into two classes, according to their situation and causes of production. Those which are formed in deep hollows between the ridges or at the bases of mountains, and which are supplied with water by springs or torrents, are classed together; and those which are formed in low and level countries by the surplus water of rivers, or from a want of sufficient declivity in the ground to allow the waters to continue their course, constitute a second class. But there are several other characteristics belonging to lakes, which justify a more minute division; and four distinct kinds have been recognised. The first class comprehends those which have no issue, and into which no running water flows. These, being generally diminutive in size, do not merit much attention. Some of them, as the Arendt, in Vieille Marche, are formed by the sinking down of the circumjacent lands; others, like the Lake Albano, near Rome, appear to be old volcanic craters filled with water. The second class consists of those lakes which discharge, but receive no running water. These are formed by springs, which, rising in a hollow place or reservoir, fill it before they find an outlet for their own waters. These lakes, however, are fed by small, almost invisible, streams, which descend from contiguous heights, or from subterraneous canals. Lakes of this description are often the source of large rivers, and they are naturally situated on great elevations. There is one of this kind on Mount Rotando, in Corsica, which is 9294< feet above the level of the sea. The third class, consisting of lakes which receive and discharge streams of water, is very numerous. Each of these lakes may be considered as a large basin or reservoir for receiving the accumulated waters of the neighbouring countries. They have in general only one opening, which almost always takes its name from the principal river which flows into it. These rivers are sometimes said to traverse the lakes; but this is scarcely correct, as their waters mingle with those of the basin over which they are diffused. These lakes have often sources of their own, either near the borders, or in their bottom. There are four or five lakes of this class in North America, which in magnitude resemble seas, but which preserve their clearness and sweetness notwithstanding, by the flow of a continual stream of fresh water. Sometimes a chain of lakes are connected with one another and with the ocean, by a series of rivers. This is the case with the great lakes on the northern frontier of North America,. where basin succeeds basin on a lower level, like so many locks of a canal. A fourth class of lakes are those which receive streams of water, and often great rivers, without having apparently any outlet. These lakes are in general confined to warm climates; but the Caspian Sea, the largest of all lakes, belongs to this class. (See the article on the Caspian Sea.) There arc a great many others besides in Asia; and South America contains the Lake Titicaca, which has no efflux, although it receives very considerable rivers into it. Such lakes appear to belong to the interior of great continents; they are placed on elevated plains, which have no sensible declivity towards the sea, and which do not allow of the water opening for itself a passage through which to flow out. It was long conjectured, that, by some subterraneous channel, lakes of this description communicated with the sea; but the fact that the surfaces of some of the most remarkable of them, such as the Caspian and the Dead Sea, are depressed below the level of the ocean, is quite sufficient to explode this hypothesis. For were there any communication, however small, the ocean would flow into the lake till it brought it to a level with itself. The true explanation seems to be, that a quantity of water equal to that which runs in is carried off by evaporation. The absorption of liquid by the contiguous land may also materially assist in carrying off the surplus fluid. There is another class of lakes, which differ materially from any of the preceding, namely, those which are contamed in cavities quite covered over by earthy strata. These are probably very numerous, for it frequently happens, that after any violent convulsion of the globe, such as an earthquake, they become exposed to view; and, by the operations of mining, digging of wclls, and the like, they have often been met with. Some of them appear to be the source of rivers, whilst others are known to receive very considerable streams, which lose themselves in the interior. Such are the numerous cavities of the Julian Alps. Certain lakes situated above ground periodically disappear; and their waters, it is most probable, flow into similar reservoirs. That very extensive subterranean cavities exist, is sufficiently attested by numerous phenomena. The disappearance of rivers, the waters thrown up by volcanoes, the sudden and terrible inundation of mines, the mountains which are suddenly en-gu]phed in the bosom of lakes, and the springs of fresh water which spout up in the midst of the ocean, are all so many evidences of the fact. There is a district in the interior of Algiers, where the inhabitants, after digging to a depth of about two hundred fathoms, invariably come to water, which flows up in such abundance that they çall it the subterranean sea.\n",
      "The physical phenomena which certain lakes present are very remarkable, and were calculated to excite astonishment in an age when the operation of natural causes was not sufficiently attended to. Periodical lakes are the most common. Those which are formed by excessive rains, and which are evaporated by solar influence, are sometimes of great magnitude, as in tropical climates, where they cover spaces of several hundred leagues in length and breadth. Towards the poles they shrink into mere pools, scarcely worthy of notice. But there are lakes entirely independent of the rainy season, which appear and disappear at certain intervals, although these changes do not secm to take place at regular intervals. With regard to such sheets of water, Malte-Brun observes: “If there exist now in the numerous cavities of the earth subterraneous lakes of this kind, and if these communicate with other lakes which are visible, it is easy to imagine that the waters of these last may sometimes entirely disappear, by 7 sinking down into the basin of the subterraneous lakes in proportion as they dry up. This lower basin again filling itself anew, the waters issue from it to fill the superior basin. If, in a supposable series of subterraneous cavities, the last link of the chain happen to be a mass of subterraneous water, situated at an elevated level in the bosom of a mountain, the periodical return of the waters in the visible basin may be accompanied by a motion similar to that of the spouting fountains. It is by means of such hydraulic machinery that nature keeps up the wonders of the lake of Cirknitz in Illyria, and in many others of the same description.”\n",
      "There are some lakes which present very remarkable phenomena, such as rising and falling like a tide, and boiling, and becoming agitated even during serene weather. Some of the Scottish lakes, and the Welter in Sweden, often experience violent commotion when the atmosphere is perfectly still. It seems highly probable that these agitations are connected with earthquakes in distant countries; and a coincidence in dates on certain occasions has given countenance to this belief. In Portugal there is a small lake or pool near Beja in Alemtejo, which emits a loud noise on the approach of a storm. Other lakes appear agitated by the disengagement of subterranean gases, or by winds which blow in some cavern with which the lake communicates. Near Boleslaw, in Bohemia, there is a lake of unfathomable depth, which sometimes in winter emits blasts of wind so strong as to elevate to some height ponderous pieces of ice. In the Marche of Brandeburg, the pool of Krcstin often commences in fine weather to boil up in whirlpools, so as to engulph small fishing boats.\n",
      "With regard to depth, lakes vary infinitely. In those situated in mountainous districts, it is remarkably great; that of Lochness, in Scotland, is one hundred and thirty fathoms in some parts. The general depth of the Caspian Sea is from sixty to seventy fathoms ļ. but this increases towards the southern end to such a degree that no bottom can be found with a line of three hundred and eighty fathoms. The lake of Geneva attains the great depth of one hundred and sixty-one fathoms, and there are many others known to be exceedingly deep, without the amount being exactly ascertained. Several have passed for ages amongst the vulgar as bottomless; but this opinion, it is scarcely necessary to say, is unworthy of credit. Yet we are not to reckon as fabulous the accounts of lakes with double bottoms, which are said to be found in Sweden and elsewhere. This phenomenon is supposed to arise from interwoven roots becoming incrusted, and, being suspended near the bottom of a lake, rise and fall according to circumstances, thus causing the depth to vary in appearance In regard to the temperature of lakes, see the article Climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distinct from any of the characteristics of lakes yet alluded to, is the chemical nature of their waters. Lakes, in respect to the quality of the waters, arc distinguished into fresh, saline, and alkaline. Those which receive and discharge considerable quantities of fresh water are almost always kept themselves in a state of perfect freshness; but those which have no outlet are invariably saline. Thus the Dead Sea, whose waters have no efflux, and into which the river Jordan continually flows, contains about eight times as much salt as c\n",

      "a county in Scotland, situated between 55. 20. and 55. 56. north latitude, and 3. 25. and 4. 22. west longitude. It is bounded on the north by the counties of Dumbarton and Stirling, on the east by those of Edinburgh, Linlithgow, and Peebles, by Dumfriesshire on the south, and by the counties of Ayr and Renfrew on the west. In length, from north to south, it is about forty-seven miles; its greatest breadth, from east to west, is thirty-two, and it extends over 942 square miles, or 602,880 English acres, of which about 271,000 acres are under cultivation. It is divided into three wards; the Upper, of which Lanark is the chief town, containing about two thirds of its area, on the east, south, and southwest, the greater part mountainous; the Middle, which has the town of Hamilton in its centre, stretching along the west and north; and the Lower, containing the city of Glasgow, and a small tract around it.\n",
      "This extensive district presents great variety of surface. Some of the mountains in the Upper Ward, where it is bounded by Dumfriesshire, are about 3000 feet high; and Tintock, on the northern boundary of the hilly district, is nearly 2300. Leadhills, a village on its southern extremity, is 1564 feet above the level of the sea, being the highest įphabited ground in Scotland. But in proceeding along the banks of the Clyde north from Tintock, the face of the country softens down to gentle elevations and depressions, and for twelve miles the river winds slowly through fertile haughs. The Middle Ward is much less elevated, few of the heights being little more than 700 feet above sea level; the town of Hamilton is only about eighty; yet there are no plains of any extent except along the banks of the Clyde, and a considerable part of the surface is covered with moss, in many places to a great depth. Of the Lower, the greater part is a highly ornamented district, particularly the banks of the Clyde, which are thickly planted with villas, the summer residence of the wealthy inhabitants of the city of Glasgow.\n",
      "The principal river, and, in a commercial point of view, the greatest in Scotland, is the Clyde, from which the county is frequently called Clydesdale. It has its rise in the ridge of mountains which separate Lanarkshire from Dumfriesshire, and, flowing first north and then northwest, through the middle of the county, falls into the frith of the same name above Greenock, carrying with it the waters collected from 1200 square miles. The principal streams which join it on the south are Duneaton, Douglas, Nethan, Avon, and West Calder; and on the north the Medwin, Mouse, South and North Calders, and Kelvin, which separates Lanarkshire from Dumbartonshire. The Clyde is navigable to Glasgow for vessels of more than 300 tons burden, and drawing thirteen feet water; and two miles higher up for smaller vessels. Most kinds of the fish found in the other rivers of Scotland are also found in the Clyde; but it is supposed that the great increase of trade on the river, and the use of the water for the various purposes of manufacture, have been injurious to the fisheries.\n",
      "Sandstone and limestone are the prevailing rocks in the lower parts of Lanarkshire, and argillaceous schistus in the high grounds. In the Cathkin Hills, near Glasgow, there is a number of basaltic columns, more than forty feet high, inclined at an angle of about seventy degrees. Ironstone abounds in many parts of the county, and is wrought to a great extent, there having been nineteen furnaces in operation in 1835, producing 56,000 tons of iron annually, exclusive of six furnaces in preparation, calculated to make 13,000 tons additional, being more than three fourths of the whole quantity made in Scotland. The great increase in this manufacture has been partly attributed to the hot-blast invented by Mr Neilson of Glasgow, first tried on a large scale in the Clyde iron-works, and immediately thereafter adopted at the Calder works. The use of this improvement is rapidly extending, and is likely to effect a most beneficial change on the production of this valuable metal. On the southern extremity are the well-known lead-mines belonging to the Earl of Hopetoun, from which the village of Leadhills takes its name. These mines now yield annually only 700 tons of lead, being less than the half of the quantity produced  during the war. This deficiency is attributed solely to the want of demand, the ore being still found in abundance. A manufactory of small shot was established about two years ago. In the same quarter gold was discovered in the time of James HL, and afterwards collected in considerable quantities, from which the celebrated “bonnet pieces” of James V. were coined. But coal is by far the most important of its mineral treasures. It is supposed to stretch throughout an area of about 70,000 acres, and, including the different seams, tobe about ten feet thick. The field near Glasgow contains eight seams, one of them seven feet thick, the whole amounting to upwards of thirty feet. There are several good seams of cannel or candle coal in different parts of the county. This kind has been long used by the country people for lighting their houses, and is now carried in great quantities to Glasgow and other towns, for the manufacture of gas.\n",
      "The valued rent of Lanarkshire is L.162,1l8. !6s. 10d. Scots, and the real rent of lands, houses, mines, and quarries, is L.75l,364'. Is. 2d. About two thirds of the county is the property of great landholders, but small properties are very numerous. The number of landholders above L.400 of valued rent is about seventy; and below that sum and above L.10, upwards of 750. These small estates, with those of many of the class immediately above them, are cultivated by their owners; the large ones are letout to tenants on leases, except the enclosed grass lands, a great part of which is let out from year to year for grazing only.\n",
      "The arable land is for the most part divided into farms of a moderate extent, held on leases for nineteen years; but it is notan uncommon practice to let the grazing lands for two or three crops only, for which a high rent is often obtained. The sheep pastures in the mountain districts yield a rent averaging about two shillings and ninepence per acre, and the arable land about twenty shillings, the best in general being only cultivated. In the lower portion of the Upper Ward, where cultivation is more indiscriminate, the average is not much higher; but in the Middle and Lower Wards the average of arable land may he computed at thirty shillings. Much of the arable land in the first division is dry and fertile; clay prevails in the second and third; and along the banks of the Clyde there are considerable tracts of an alluvial description. Of late years much land has been reclaimed and improved by draining; and incalculable benefit has been derived from the planting of clumpsand strips of trees in exposed situations, although this practice has not yet become so general as its importance obviously demands. The present system of entails, under which a great proportion of the land in this county is held, has been much blamed for retarding such improvements.\n",
      "As this county slopes to the west almost throughout its whole extent, the Atlantic exerts a powerful influence on its climate. For about two thirds of the year the wind blows from the south-west and west. Intense frosts are of short duration, and snow seldom lies long in the lower districts; but, from the general humidity of the atmosphere, and also of the soil, seed-time and harvest are often late. In regard to heat, there is a considerable difference between the Upper and Middle Wards, the thermometer on the same day commonly standing several degrees higher in the latter than in the former. Its range is from eleven to eighty-five degrees. The quantity of rain that falls at Glasgow varies from fourteen and a half to twenty-eight and a half inches, the average for thirty years being twenty-two and a third; but at Lanark the influence of the Atlantic is less sensibly felt, owing probably to its open and elevated situation. This however may, equally with the great humidity of the other wards, account for the lateness of the harvest. Lanarkshire is therefore, upon the whole, less favourable to the culture of corn than the eastern counties of Scotland.\n",
      "The dairy is accordingly an object of considerable importance here, and is carried on in all its branches. Besides the dairies kept in and near the city of Glasgow, for supplying the inhabitants with milk, cream, and fresh butter, a great number of cows are kept in the landward districts, the produce of which is applied to making butter and cheese, and the fattening of calves. The cheese is in general equal in quality to the best Dunlop, and brings the highest prices in the Edinburgh and Glasgow markets. Lesmahagow and Carnwath parishes are said to produce the best. Within the last few years several of the Highland Society’s prizes for the best imitation of Stilton and double Gloucester cheeses have been obtained by the dairy farmers of the latter parish. The Ayrshire breed of cattle has hitherto been most prized; but a new species has recently been introduced, and found to be of superior quality, viz. the Lanarkshire newly-improved breed, crossed by the Ayrshire cow and short-horned bull, or vice versa. The draught-horses of Clydesdale have long been famous. They are supposed to have originated from some Flanders or Holstein horses brought over in the seventeenth century by one of the Dukes of Hamilton.\n",
      "From the earliest period, Clydesdale has been celebrated for its fruit. The Venerable Bede, who flourished in the eighth century, speaks of the “apple-yards of Lanark” as being then famous. Till the beginning of the present century, however, the orchards seem to have been principally confined to sloping banks, and acclivities inaccessible to the plough. But the growing prosperity and wealth of Glasgow, and the obstru\n",

      "an eminent mathematician, was born at Peakirk, near Peterborough, in Northamptonshire, in January 1719. He early became a proficient in the mathematics, for we find him a respectable contributor to the Ladies Dairy in 1744; and he was soon amongst the foremost of those who then contributed to the support of that small but valuable publication, in which a number of English mathematicians at one period or other contended for fame. Mr Landen continued his contributions to it under various signatures till within a few years of his death.\n",
      "In the forty-eighth volume of the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1754, Mr Landen published an Investigation of some theorems which suggest several very remarkable properties of the circle, and are at the same time of considerable use in resolving fractions, the denominators of which are certain multinomials, into more simple ones, and by that means facilitate the computation of fluents. This paper was handed to the Society by Mr Thomas Simpson of Woolwich; a circumstance which will convey to those who are not themselves judges some idea of its merits. In the year 1755 he published a volume entitled Mathematical Lucubrations. It contains a variety of tracts relative to the rectification of curve lines, the summation of series, the finding of fluents, and many other points in the higher parts of the mathematics.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the latter end of 1757, or the beginning of 1758, he published proposals for printing by subscription The Residual Analysis, a new branch of the algebraic art; and in 1758 he published a small tract in quarto, entitled A Discourse on the Residual Analysis, in which he resolved a variety of problems, to which the method of fluxions had been usually applied, by a mode of reasoning entirely new; compared these solutions with solutions of the same problems investigated by the fluxionary method; and showed that the solutions by his new method were, in general, more natural and elegant than the fluxionary ones. In the fifty-first volume of the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1760, he published a New Method of computing the sums of a great number of Infinite Series. This paper was also presented to the society by his ingenious friend Mr Thomas Simpson. In 1774< he published the first book of The Residual Analysis, in 4to, with several copperplates. In this treatise, besides explaining the principles on which his new analysis was founded, he applied it to drawing tangents and finding the properties of curve lines; to describing their involutes and evolutes, finding the radius of curvature, their greatest and least ordinates, and points of contrary fluxure; to the determination of their cusps, and the drawing of asymptotes ;—and he proposed in a second book to extend the application of this new analysis to a great variety of mechanical and physical subjects. The papers which were to have formed this book lay long by him; but he never found leisure to put them in order for the press. In January 1766 Mr Landen was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and admitted in the April following. In the fifty-eighth volume of the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1768, he published a specimen of a new method of comparing curvilineal areas, by means of which many areas are compared, that did not appear to be comparable by any other method; a circumstance of no small importance in that part of natural philosophy which relates to the doctrine of motion. In the sixtieth volume of the same work, for the year 1770, he gave some new theorems for computing the whole areas of curve lines, where the ordinates are expressed by fractions of a certain form, in a more concise and elegant manner than had been done by Cotes, Demoivre, and others, who had considered the subject before him. In the sixty-first volume, for 1771, hc investigated several new and useful theorems for computing certain fluents, which are assignable by arcs of the conic sections. This subject had been considered before, both by Mr Maclaurin and Μ. d’Alembert; but some of the theorms which were given by these celebrated mathematicians, being in part expressed by the difference between an arc of a hyperbola and its tangent, and that difference being not directly attainable when the arc and its tangent both become infinite, as they will do when the whole fluent is wanted, although such fluent be finite; the theorems therefore fail in those cases, and the computation becomes impracticable without further help. This defect Mr Landen has removed by assigning the limit of the difference between the hyperbolic arc and its tangent, whilst the point of contact is supposed to be removed to an infinite distance from the vertex of the curve. And he concludes the paper with a curious and remarkable property relating to pendulous bodies, which is deducible from these theorems. In the same year he published an animadversion on Dr Stewart’s computation of the Sun\"s distance from the Earth. In the sixty-fifth volume of the Philosophical Transactions for 1775, appeared the investigation of a general theorem, which he had promised in 1771, for finding the length of any arc of a conic hyperbola by means of two elliptic arcs; and by the theorems there investigated, both the elastic curve and the curve of equable recession from a given point may be constructed in those cases where Mr Maclaurin’s elegant method fails. In the sixtyseventh volume, for 1777, he gave a new theory of the motion of bodies revolving about an axis in free space, when that motion is disturbed by some extraneous force, either percussive or accelerative. At this time he did not know that the subject had been handled by any other person; and he considered only the motion of a sphere’s spheroid and cylinder. The publication of this paper, however, was the cause of his being told that the doctrine of rotatory motion had been considered by Μ. d’Alembert; and having purchased that author’s Opuscules Mathématiques, he there learned that Μ. d’Alembert was not the only one who had considered the matter before him; for Μ. d’Alembert speaks of some mathematician, though he does not mention his name, who, after reading what had been written on the subject, doubted whether there existed any solid whatever, besides the sphere, in which a line, passing through its centre of gravity, would be a permanent axis of rotation. In consequence of this, Mr Landen took up the subject again; and though he did not then give a solution of the general problem, namely, to determine the motions of a body of any form whatever revolving without restraint about any axis passing through its centre of gravity, he fully removed every doubt of the kind which had been started by the person alluded to by Μ. d’Alembert, and pointed out several bodies, which, under certain dimensions, possess that remarkable property. This paper is published, amongst many others equally curious, in a volume of Memoirs which he gave to the world in 1780. But what renders that volume yet more valuable, is a very extensive Appendix, containing theorems for the calculation of fluents. The tables which contain these theorems arc more complete and extensive than any which are to be found in other authors, and are chiefly of his own investigating; being such as had occurred to him in the course of a long and curious application to almost every branch of the mathematical sciences. In the years 1781, 1782, and 1783, he published three little tracts on the summation of converging series, in which he explained the extent of some theorems which had been given for that purpose by Demoivre, Mr Sterling, and Thomas Simpson, in answer to some things which he thought had been written to the disparagement of these mathematicians.\n",
      "About the beginning of the year 1782 Mr Landen had made such improvements in his theory of rotatory motion, as he thought would enable him to give a solution of the general problem specified above; but finding the result to differ very materially from that of the solution which had been given by Μ. d’Alembert, and not being able to see clearly where that gentleman had erred, he did not venture to make his own public. In the course of that year having procured the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy for 1757, containing Μ. Euler’s solution of the problem, he found that it gave the same result as had been deduced by Μ. d’Alembert; but the perspicuity of Μ. Euler’s manner of writing enabled him to discover where he had erred, which the obscurity of the other did not do. The agreement, however, of two writers of such established reputation as Μ. Euler and Μ. d’Alembert made him long dubious of the truth of his own solution, and induced him to revise the process again and again with the utmost circumspection; but being every time more convinced that his own solution was right and theirs wrong, he at length gave it to the public in the seventy-fifth volume of the Philosophwal Transactions for 1785.\n",
      "The extreme difficulty of the subject, joined to the concise manner in which Mr Landen had been obliged to give his solution inorder to confine it within proper limits for the Transactions, rendered it too difficult, or at least too laborious a piece of business, for most mathematician»\n",

But although these attempts were manifestly abortive, as every one who perused them saw, yet they convinced Mr Landen that there was a necessity for giving his solution at greater length, in order to render it more generally understood. About this time also he met by chance with Frisi’s work on cosmography, physics, and mathematics, in the second part of which there is a solution of this problem, agreeing in the result with those of Euler and D’Alembert; which is not surprising, as Frisi employed the same principle that they did.\n",

      "commonly known by the name of the Projector, was the eldest son of William Law, and was born at Edinburgh in the month of April 1671. His father followed the profession of goldsmith or banker, with so much success, that he was enabled to purchase the lands of Lauriston and Randleston, which afterwards descended to his son. The latter was educated at Edinburgh, where he is said to have made some progress in literature; but the bent of his genius having led him to study arithmetic and geometry, he attained such proficiency in these branches, as to be able to solve with facility the most intricate problems; and hc likewise made himself master of algebra. The prin ciples of public and private credit, the state of trade and of manufactures, the theory and practice of taxation, and other matters connected with political economy, also engaged his attention; and the accession of knowledge resulting from these inquiries laid the foundation of his future eminence. But he soon became noted as a man of pleasure as well as of study. Having lost his father before he had completed his fourteenth year, he was thus left at an early age without paternal control; and as the graces of a naturally handsome person were improved by the acquisition of external accomplishments, Jessamy John, or Beau Law, as he was indifferently called by his companions, addicted himself to the practice of all games of chance, skill, and dexterity, and appears to have engaged in other pursuits of a still more questionable character. In 1694, he visited London, where his wit and accomplishments procured him admission into the first circles, whilst his extravagance speedily involved him in difficulties. At this time he was noted for his propensity to deep play, and for his gallantries amongst women. By the former, he injured his fortune; in consequence of the latter, he narrowly escaped an ignominious end. An intrigue which he had with a Mrs Lawrence proved the occasion of a quarrel between him and one Mr Edward Wilson; a hostile meeting ensued, and Mr Law killed his antagonist on the spot. He was immediately apprehended, and brought to trial at the Old Bailey, on a charge of murder; and being found guilty, received sentence of death. Upon a representation of the case to the crown, however, Law obtained a pardon; but an appeal being lodged by a brother of the deceased, he was detained in the King’s Bench prison. This appeal was brought before the court of King’s Bench in Trinity-term 1694; and as the exceptions taken on the part of Law were overruled by the court, the latter, judging it prudent not to await the result, found means to escape from prison,^[1. In the London Gazette of Monday, 7th January 1G95, a reward o'f fifty pounds was offered for the apprehension of “ Captain John Law, a Scotchman, lately a prisoner in the King’s Bench for murther,” who is described as u a very tall, black, lean man, well shaped, above six foot high, large pock-holes in his face, big high nosed, speaks broad and loud.” This description, which conveys no very favourable idea of Law’s personal appearance, and differs from his real portrait, is supposed by Mr Wood to have been drawn up with a view to facilitate his escape. The prefix of “Captain,” which is otherwise a good travelling title, may also, perhaps, be explained on the same hypothesis. ] and retired to the Continent.\n",
      "During his stay abroad, he acted for some time as secretary to the British resident in Holland, and occupied himself in improving his knowledge of financial operations, and particularly in making himself acquainted with the constitution and practical operation of the bank of Amsterdam. He returned to his native country in 1700, and in that year appears to have written his Proposals and Reasons for Establishing α Council of Trade, which was published at Edinburgh early in 1701. His project met with no encouragement; but the publication had the effect of making him known to some of the principal personages of the country, including the Duke of Argyll, his sons the Marquis of Lorn and Lord Archibald Campbell, the Marquis of Tweeddale, and other persons of distinction. Relying upon the support of these noblemen, he offered to the Scottish parliament, in 1705, a plan for removing the difficulties under which the kingdom then laboured from the scarcity of specie, and the stoppage of payments by the bank; and, with a view to further his object, he published another work, entitled Money and Trade considered, with a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money, which appeared at Edinburgh the same year. His “proposal” was, that commissioners, to be appointed by an act, under the control of parliament, should be empowered to issue notes, either in the way of loan, at ordinary interest, upon landed security, the debt, however, not to exceed half, or at the most two thirds, of the value of the land; or upon landpledges, redeemable within a certain period, to the full value of the land; or, lastly, upon sale irredeemably to the amount of the price agreed upon. Paper-money, thus issued and secured, would, he conceived, be equal in value to gold and silver money of the same denomination, and might even be preferred to these metals, as not being, like them, liable to fall in value. But this scheme, though supported by the united weight of the court party, and of that called the squadrone, headed by the Duke of Argyll and the Marquis of Tweeddale, was rejected by the parliament, which resolved, “that to establish any kind of paper credit, so as to oblige it to pass, was an improper expedient for the nation.” The rejection of the plan was occasioned by an apprehension, that if it were adopted, all the estates of the kingdom would thereby be brought to a complete dependence upon the government.\n",
      "Mr Law now resolved to abandon his native country, and to try his fortune abroad. He resided some time at Brussels, where he became noted for extraordinary success at play; and in two excursions which he made to Paris, his good fortune at the gaming-table became still more conspicuous. Having visited the principal cities of Italy, he continued the same career, playing at all sorts of games, and betting and speculating in the public funds and banks, with uninterrupted success; insomuch that, in theyear 1714, he was worth upwards of L.l 10,000 sterling. During these rambles, Law, having the advantage of a graceful figure and an insinuating address, was everywhere well received by persons of the highest quality. At Florence he became acquainted with the Duke de Vendôme, whom he had the honour to oblige with the loan of a considerable sum of money. At Neufchâtel he obtained access to the Prince of Conti, to whom he imparted some of his financial projects. During a short residence at Turin, he communicated to Victor Amadeus, king of Sardinia, a scheme for aggrandising his territories, of the same nature as that which he afterwards proposed to the Duke of Orleans; but the prudent monarch declined embarking in so perilous an adventure, observing to the projector, that his dominions were too small for the execution of so great a design, and that France was the proper theatre for such speculations. “If I know the disposition of the people of that country,” added Victor Amadeus, “I am sure they will relish your schemes; and therefore I would advise you to go thither without delay.”\n",
      "Law took the advice which was thus given him, and re-, turned to Paris, where he arrived in 1714, not long before the death of Louis XIV. He was more favourably received than on the occasions of his former visits, when he appears to have been regarded as a mere adventurer; and soon gained the confidence of the Duke of Orleans to such a degree, that he was not only admitted to the convivial parties of the regent, but even nominated one of his counsellors of state. At this time the French finances were in the greatest disorder, indeed in a situation accounted desperate; the nation was burthened with an immense load of debt, contracted during the expensive wars of Louis XIV.; and the people groaned under the intolerable pressure of the taxes which had been imposed for payment of the interest. All industry was thus checked, and trade in a manner annihilated; manufactures, commerce, and navigation, had almost ceased; the merchant and the trader were reduced to beggary, and the artificer was compelled, for want of employment, to leave the kingdom. In a word, the state of affairs was such, that it had been debated in council, and actually proposed to apply a spunge to the debt, and to seek relief by means of a national bankruptcy. The proposal, however, was rejected by the regent, and a commission appointed to inquire into the claims of the state creditors, and endeavour to introduce some degree of order into the public finances. At this calamitous crisis, when the surplus of the public revenue, after payment of the interest of the debt, was found insufficient to defray the necessary expenses of the civil government, Law came forward with his favourite nostrum or panacea, and proposed to liquidate the debt, by establishing a bank for issuing notes secured upon landed property, and on the unalienable impledgement of all the royal revenues. The project seems to have been approved of, but as the conjuncture was thought unfavourable for risking so bold an experiment, his application proved ineffectual. Nothing discouraged, Law requested and obtained permission to establish a private bank, to consist entirely of funds advanced by himself, and others who chose to embark in the undertaking. The letters-patent, which are dated the 2d and 20th of May 1716, specify the principles upon which the bank had been established, as well as the regulations according to which it was to be conducted. The scheme promised success, and, in fact, the General Bank of Law and Company had acquired great credit, when, in December 1718, it was dissolved by an arrêt of the regent, who, observing \n",

      "an English inland county. It is bounded on the north by Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, on the west by the latter county and Warwickshire, on the south by Northamptonshire, and on the east by Rutlandshire and Lincolnshire. It is of a triangular form, and few of its limits are marked by nature, as the rivers Soar and Trent form only a part of its northern boundary, and the river Anker a smaller portion of its western frontier. Its greatest length from north to south is forty-five miles, and its greatest breadth from east to west thirty-five miles. Its area contains 816 square miles. It is divided into six hundreds, in which are ten towns and 196 parishes. The population at the four decennial enumerations has been estimated as follows:—In 1801 it amounted to 130,081, in 1811 to 150,419, in 1821 to 174,571, and in 1831 to 197,000. The annual value of the real property, as assessed in the year 1815, was L.902,217. The burials, including both the registered and unregistered, in the period from 1821 to 1831, appear to have been only one in fifty-two of the whole number of inhabitants then living. The proportion of illegitimate to legitimate births was only one to twenty-eight, whereas, in the whole of England, it was one to twenty.

      "The county of Leicester may be described generally as a level district, the undulations of which are very gentle, and exhibit but few interesting prospects. The exceptions to this remark are the Charnwood Hills, on the northern part of the county, which rise in an insulated mass, and from the summit of which the rest of the county appears extended in a well-wooded but even surface under the feet. The most lofty eminence of this range of bills (commonly denominated the Forest i though it is destitute of trees) is Bardon Hill, the summit of which is 850 feet above the level of the sea. The Vale of Belvoir, in which the castle of the Duke of Rutland stands, displays much beauty, of a soft rather than a romantic or picturesque character.\n",
      "None of the rivers of this county are considerable streams, nor are any of them calculated for the conveyance of commodities, except the Soar, for a short distance; but they are abundant, and contribute to increase the beauty and fertility of the district. Their names are, the Anker, Avon, Blackbrook, Deane, Eye, Scalford, Sence, Snite, Soar, Swift, Trent, Willand, and Wreke. The intercourse of the county, both in its own different districts, and with the surrounding parts of the kingdom, is amply provided for by several navigable canals. One of these connects the town of Leicester with the Grand Junction Canal, in Northamptonshire; another communicates by Loughborough with the river Trent; another from the coal-mines near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, passes by Hinckley, and proceeds into Warwickshire; and one is designed to connect Melton-Mowbray with the centre of Rutlandshire.\n",
      "Though the soil is various, yet, in general, it may be classed under the denominations either of clay or of loam; for there are very feŵ portions of it that are calcareous, sandy, or gravelly. The best soil is on the hills, and generally the valleys consist of a cold clay, very wet in the winter, and with the turf so tender as scarcely to bear the treading of sheep in that season. The soil is naturally productive of the best and most abundant crops of grass, and is better fitted for feeding cattle than for arable culture. In consequence of this quality, a very small portion is under the plough; but that portion produces most excellent wheat, oats, and beans, which have acquired great celebrity. There are few open fields now remaining, and the quantity of waste land is very small. The principal productions of the county are sheep and cows. Mr Bakewell, whose fame in improving the breeds of all cattle is generally known, has been the means of stocking this county first, and afterwards many other parts of England, with a race of sheep produced by various crosses, which by many farmers is now preferred to every other, and universally known by the name of the new Leicesters. They unite perfect symmetry of shape with the smallest possible quantity of bone and offal, and their wool is both fine and abundant. The horned cattle were, in like manner, improved by the lessons of this skilful breeder; and no part of England exceeds Leicestershire either in its beef or in the produce of the dairy. The cheese commonly made is in great request throughout all the north of England; and the kind called Stilton, from having been first sold in that town, though made near Melton-Mowbray, is perhaps the richest in the world. The process of making it was long kept a secret in a few villages, but is now universally known. Its richness arises from one half the milk being skimmed, and the cream taken from that added to the other milk, so that the cheeses have double the usual quantity of cream in their composition. Bakewell improved also the breed of horses to a great extent. In this line there was less room for any extraordinary progress; but his black horses, of the cart kind, originating principally from mares which he brought from Flanders, enabled him to introduce the method of ploughing with two horses abreast, by which much labour in agriculture has been saved.\n",
      "The manufacture of most consequence in this county is that of hosiery, which gives employment, more or less constant, to two thirds of its inhabitants. The quantity of stockings made here is prodigious, and supplies the greater part of the British dominions, as well as many other parts of the world, with those of an inferior and middling quality. Stocking-frames were invented about 1590; but the first introduced in Leicestershire was used at Hinckley in 1640. Since that period many improvements in the machinery of them have been made. The chief seat of this manufacture is in the town of Leicester, in which there are 3400 manufacturers, of whom 3000 are stocking-makers. Loughborough has 900, Hinckley 700, Sheepshead 500, Wigston and Shilton 280 each; and in many of the smaller places there are to be found to the number of from 100 to 200 weavers of hosiery and gloves. About 700 men are employed in making lace, chiefly at Melton-Mowbray and Quornden. The makers of machinery are numerous, and in the county some linen is manufactured, and also some carpets. The making of stuffs at Harborough has nearly disappeared.\n",
      "In the north-west part of the county there are extensive mines of valuable coal, which supply the inhabitants of the surrounding districts. With them terminate the mines in the direction of the German Ocean to the southward. At Bredon, on the confines, the singular rock called Bredon Hill is composed of a most valuable kind of limestone, which forms an excellent cement in water, and which was used for building the pier of Ramsgate.\n",
      "The Roman roads are still visible in many parts of the county, though in many instances they have been covered by the more recent highways. The Watling-Street road, the Fossway, and the Via Davana, traversed the county, and have been traced with great accuracy by antiquaries. At Radcliffe, on the Wreke, is an ancient tumulus, generally attributed to the Celts, 350 feet in length, and 120 in breadth. At Leicester, which was a Roman station, are still visible the remains of the architecture of that people, in what is called the Jewny Wall, consisting of a mass of stones, brick-work, and dilapidated arches, built in alternate courses of brick in three layers, and of stone. Near the town is the vestige of a British Cursus, according to some antiquaries, or of a Roman camp, according to others. At different and distant periods a great number of coins have been discovered, with the names of Titus, Trajan, Diocletian, Constantine, Constantius, Hadrian, and other Roman emperors. Other Roman antiquities have been found at Rothley, at Wanlip, at Market-Harborough, at Burrow, and at Cathorpe. The Gothic remains are considerable; those of the Abbey of Leicester, of the Nunnery of Grace Dieu, Ulvestoft Priory, Laund Priory, the Castle of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, the churches of Hinckley and Melton-Mowbray, and the chapel of Market-Harborough, all reward the inspection of the antiquary.\n",
      "In the church of Lutherworth, the pulpit and part of the vestments of the gneat reformer Wickliffe are still preserved. He was buried there in the year 1387; but in 1428, his bones were taken up and burnt, and the ashes thrown into the river, by order of the council of Sienna. Leicestershire has been the scene of two great military events, which have been the means of transferring the government of England; the first, the battle of Bosworth, which terminated the reign and life of Richard III. in 1485; and the other, the battle of Naseby in 1645, which led to the death of Charles I., and the subsequent elevation of Oliver Cromwell.\n",

      "Claude) Charles, a diligent and accurate astronomer, born at Paris, on the 23d of November 1715, was the son of Peter Lemonnier, of St Sever, in Normandy.\n",
      "His father was a professor of philosophy in the College d’Harcourt, and member of the Academy of Sciences. He distinguished himself, as a teacher, by his activity in promoting the introduction of mathematical reasoning into the Cartesian philosophy. Under such auspices, the son might have enjoyed facilities for the cultivation of any of the sciences; but he soon showed a decided preference for astronomy, and began to be a practical observer before he was sixteen. In the month of November 1732, Mr Fouchy procured him the use of a mural quadrant of three feet radius, and he soon applied himself with diligence to the determination of the sun’s greatest equation, an investigation which he continued for many years; and in 1741, he found the equation to amount to 1° 55' 3ľ'; a quantity differing only by 7\" from Delambre’s latest determination.\n",
      "He presented to the Academy of Sciences, in 1735, an elaborate map of the moon, accompanied by some remarks; and in the month of April of the following year, before he was twenty-one years old, he was made a member of the Academy, in the character of Adjunct Geometrician. He continued to be a constant contributor to its Memoirs for more than fifty years. The winter of 1736 and 1737 he passed at Torneo, with Clairaut and Maupertuis, as a member of a committee appointed by the Academy for measuring a degree in Lapland; and he was not less zealous than any of his colleagues in the execution of that arduous undertaking.\n",
      "He is considered as having effected, in conjunction with Lacaille, a complete reformation in the practical astronomy of France. He entered very early into correspondence with the English astronomers of the day; they had carried their instruments and modes of observation to a higher degree of perfection than their neighbours; and Lemonnier was of great use to the science, in making known to his countrymen the practical methods of Flamsteed, and in introducing the instruments of Graham and Bird.' In April 1739, he was made a foreign member of the Royal Society of London, and for the last twelve or fourteen years of his life he is said to have been the senior member of the society. He was the first that introduced the effects of nutation, then lately discovered by Bradley, into the solar tables; and he complained bitterly of Lacaille’s injustice, in not giving him due credit for the improvement.\n",
      "The Due de Noailles made him known to the king of France, who was fond of his company, and showed him many kindnesses. In 1742, he gave him apartments at the Capucins in the Rue St Honoré, where he continued to live till the Revolution. On another occasion, when he had taken great pains to fix an accurate meridian at St Sulpice, the king made him a present of 15,000 livres, which he expended in the purchase of instruments, as the greatest luxury that be was capable of enjoying.\n",
      "The places of the stars, which he determined in 1740, served Lalande for the purpose of computing their proper motions, though they differed a little from the results of Bradley’s observations. About 1746, he was much engaged in examining the inequalities of Saturn, produced by the attraction of Jupiter; and Euler employed his computations in the theory which obtained a prize in 1748; each confirming the accuracy of the other. He continued to observe the moon, without intermission, for fifty years, though a small part only of his observations was published.\n",
      "In the year 1748 he went to England, partly for the purpose of obtaining further information from a personal acquaintance with the astronomers and opticians resident in London, and partly in order to observe the solar eclipse  of that year, in a situation where it would be very nearly annular. He proceeded accordingly to Scotland with the Earl of Morton, accompanied by Short the optician, and they observed the eclipse together at Aberdour, an ancient residence of Lord Morton’s, in Fifeshire. They obtained their time from the College at Edinburgh, where there was a transit instrument, by means of the flash of a cannon fired from the castle at twelve, and another five minutes after. “The eclipse was so nearly annular, that, at the nearest approach, the cusps seemed to want about one-seventh of the moon’s circumference to be joined; yet a brown light was plainly observed, both by Lord Morton and myself,” says Mr Short, “to proceed or stretch along the circumference of the moon, from each of the cusps, about one third of the whole distance of the cusps from each cusp; and there remained about one third of the whole distance of the cusps not enlightened by this brown light, so that we were for some time in suspense whether or not we were to have the eclipse annular with us. During the greatest darkness, the planet Venus was seen at Edinburgh, and other places, by a great number of people, but I did not hear of any other stars being seen. The darkness was not great, but th© sky appeared of a faint languid colour.” In fact, our mornings and evenings are always illuminated by a light, which has acquired more or less of a red tinge in its oblique passage through the atmosphere; and when we have a similar light without the redness, the contrast between the sensation and the memory makes it appear “faint,” that is, greenish or grey, instead of white. Mr Lemonnier was particularly anxious to measure the moon’s diameter, which “he found 29'47∣\", ’ ' agreeing precisely with the computed diameter, and not requiring any correction for the supposed effects of irradiation. A similar remark was made by a very accurate practical astronomer in the eclipse of 1820.\n",
      "In order to verify the position of his mural quadrant, which was of eight feet radius, and made by Bird, Lemonnier felt the advantage of having a moveable one to compare with it, and he procured a block of marble eight feet by six, and fifteen inches thick, turning on an axis, to which he fixed his smaller instrument, of five feet radius, in order to be able to reverse its position. He devoted a considerable portion of his time to the investigation of the laws of magnetism, and especially to the variation of the compass; and he endeavoured to ascertain the effect of the moon’s influence on the winds, and on the atmosphere in general.\n",
      "Lemonnier had long disputed the accuracy of the Parisian base, measured by Cassini and Maraldi, but he was at last convinced that his objections were groundless. He was originally a most zealous friend and patron of Lalande; but afterwards, having taken offence at some slight cause, he refused to see him for many years. In fact, he appears to have been somewhat obstinate and irritable; but he is said to have had genius, zeal, activity, and intelligence, as well as credit in the world, and reputation among men of science. He was a voluminous writer; he had much learning and sagacity, but he often wanted precision in his language and his reasoning. In November 1(91, he had a paralytic attack, which terminated his scientific career, though he survived it till the 2d of April 1799, when a second stroke carried him off, at Héril, near Baieux. He was made, in the mean time, one of the 14+ original members of the National Institute, as a testimony to the merit of his past labours.\n",
      "He had married, in 1763, Mlle, de Cussy, a lady of very respectable family in Normandy. He had three daughters; the first married Mr de Parfouru, who was an early victim of the Revolution; the second the celebrated Lagrange; and the third her uncle, Lemonnier the physician, who was also a man of considerable science, and a member of the Royal Society of London.\n",
      "From 1735 to 1790, there are very few volumes of the Memoirs of the Academy without one or more of Lemonnier’s papers; but though not unimportant in the aggregate, they are somewhat uninteresting in the detail. They relate almost exclusively to astronomical observations; eclipses, occultations, appulses, oppositions, and conjunctions; solstices, longitudes and latitudes; with some accounts of astronomical instruments and apparatus. There are also some memoirs relating to the sun’s equation and diameter, and on his place, as compared with Arcturus; on the motion of Saturn, and on his fifth satellite; on the expansion of wooden measures; on the transit of Venus, and on the diameter and the tables of that planet; on Euler’s formula for parallax; on the variation of the needle; on lunar altitudes; on the tides; on horizontal refraction; on Saturn’s ring; and on some currents of wind. He also published separately some extensive works, which acquired considerable celebrity.\n",

      "a character used to express one of the simple sounds of the voice. As the different simple sounds are expressed’by different letters, these, by being differently compounded, become the visible signs or characters of all the modulations and varieties of sound used to express our ideas in a regular language. Thus, by the help of speech we render our ideas audible; by the assistance of letters we render them visible; and by means of these we can wrap up our thoughts, and send them to the most distant parts of the earth, or read the transactions of different ages. What letters were originally, who first invented them, and amongst what people they were primarily used, there is still reason to doubt. Philo attributes this great and noble invention to Abraham; Josephus, StIrenaeus, and others, to Enoch; Bibliander, to Adam; Eusebius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Cornelius Agrippa, and others, to Moses; Pomponius Mela, Herodian, Rufus Festus, Pliny, Lucan, and others, to the Phoenicians; St Cyprian, to Saturn; Plato and Tacitus, to the Egyptians; some, to the Ethiopians; and others, to the Chinese, who cannot possibly be entitled to this honour, since all their characters are the signs of simple ideas, and have nothing in common with letters.\n",
      "There have also been various conjectures respecting the different kinds of letters used in different languages. Thus, according to Crinitus, Moses invented the Hebrew letters; Abraham the Syriac and Chaldaic; the Phoenicians those of Attica, brought into Greece by Cadmus, and thence carried into Italy by the Pelasgians; Nicoŝtrata, the Roman; Isis, the Egyptian; and Vulfilas, those of the Goths. These, however, are but fanciful conjectures, which it is sufficient to state, and would be vain to examine or discuss.\n",
      "The natural order of invention, in the visible representation of thought, seems to be indicated, not merely by theory, but by facts ascertained from the analysis of ancient graphic remains, as well as by the practice actually followed amongst several existing nations. The primary and elemental form was unquestionably that of picture-writing, or the delineation, more or less rude, of external objects, as these present themselves to the eye; with perhaps some marks expressive of day, week, month, year, and even of time generally. The next was the hieroglyphic or ideagraphic form, which consisted not only of pictures or resemblances of external objects, but also, and in a much larger proportion, of images metaphorically or analogically transferred, so as to become signs of other things, and to indicate general notions as well as simple ideas. This was no doubt a very great improvement on picture-writing, inasmuch as it gave considerable extension and variety to the power of expression, and enabled mankind, though in a laborious form, to write their annals, inscribe their monuments, and preserve what knowledge they had acquired. The third and the last step in the gradual improvement of .writing, was the invention of letters; that is, of signs or marks expressive, not of ideas whether simple or complex, but of the elementary sounds of the human voice, lhis was the ultimate term, the final generalization, which led to the greatest and happiest of all discoveries, that of a literal alphabet.\n",
      "It is no doubt true that some nations appear to have stopped short before reaching this final term, and to have remained satisfied with a more elaborate and imperfect mode of graphic representation. The Mexicans, for instance, had not advanced beyond picture-writing, in its rudest and simplest form. The Chinese have, for ages, employed a multitude of ideagraphic characters, derived, by composition and otherwise, from a limited number of elementary pictures or representations of external objects, without making the least step towards an alphabet, on the very verge of which invention they stand as often as they employ their ideagraphic characters, phonetically, to express the sounds of a foreign proper name. The ancient Egyptians also remained contented with their hieroglyphical system; and although Plato attributes to their god Thoth the invention of letters, the honour of that discovery appears rather to have belonged to other nations, who were not trammelled by habit, or restrained by prejudice, from attempting to improve their method of written expression. But it does not follow from this, as some have pretended, that letters are not derivable from ideagraphic signs, because some nations had not the ingenuity to make the derivation. It might with as much reason be maintained, that the law of universal gravitation is not deduceable from the fact of the descent of heavy bodies in a line directed towards the centre of the earth, because the deduction was not fully made, and clearly established, until the time of Newton. The Egyptians, like the Chinese, as often as they had occasion to write a foreign proper name, employed their ideagraphic characters phonetically, that is, as alphabetical letters expressive of sounds merely; in other words, the very exigencies of their graphic system forced upon them the knowledge and the practice of an alphabet, to the extent here indicated. They were, therefore, upon the very threshold of the discovery; necessity itself had impelled them in the right direction; the slightest attempt at generalization would have led them to the grand consummation; and, if they had tried to do that, generally, which they found themselves obliged to do in particular cases, the result would have been the displacement of ideagraphic by alphabetic characters. But does it follow, because they failed to make this final step, that the invention of letters was not the natural result of that state of things which immediately preceded it; or that alphabetic writing is not an invention of man, but “a miraculous gift to him from God,” as Dr Wall of Dublin and some others contend?\n",
      "This seems to be not only unphilosophical in an eminent degree, but likewise absurd and preposterous. For if it required a miracle to deduce letters from hieroglyphics, it must have equally required one to deduce hieroglyphics, in all their complex variety of tropical, kuriological, and anaglyphic, from mere imitative representations, such as were found in use amongst the Mexicans when the Spaniards first landed in the New World. The distance between the Mexican and the Egyptian systems is fully as great as, if not greater than, the distance between phonetic hieroglyphics and the alphabet of Cadmus. If we were always to presume the interposition of miraculous agency in cases where men failed to reach inventions or discoveries, upon the very borders of which they had been standing for ages, history would become a romance, and philosophy a manual of superstition. The order of nature is not thus dislocated and disturbed; nor does the ordinary progress of invention, improvement, and generalization require to be accounted for or explained by supposititious assumptions of supernatural interposition. The miracle connected with the invention of an alphabet is its extreme simplicity, united with the almost unlimited power which it gives to man of expressing his thoughts in writing.\n",
      "Letters constitute the first or elementary part of grammar; and they are combined, first, into syllables, secondly, into words, and, thirdly, into sentences. The alphabet of every language consists of a certain number of letters, which ought to have each a different sound, figure, and use. As the difference of articulate sounds was intended to express the different ideas of the mind, so one letter was originally intended to signify only one sound, and not, as at present, to express sometimes one sound, and sometimes another; a practice which has brought a great deal of confusion into languages, and rendered the acquisition of the modern tongues much more difficult than it would otherwise have been. This consideration, together with the defects of all the known alphabets, from their wanting certain letters to express certain sounds, has occasioned several attempts to form an universal alphabet, containing an enumeration of all the single sounds or letters which are used in any language.\n",
      "Grammarians distinguish letters into vowels, consonants, mutes, liquids, diphthongs, and characteristics. They receive their denomination from the shape and turn which is given to them; and in writing are distinguished into different hands, as round text, German text, round hand, Italian, and so forth; and in printing, into Roman, Italic, and black letter.\n",
      "The term Letter, or Type, amongst printers, not only includes the capitals, small capitals, and small letters, but all the points, figures, and other marks cast and used in printing; and also the large ornamental letters cut in wood or metal, which are employed instead of the illuminated letters used in manuscripts. The letters used in printing are cast at the ends of small pieces of metal, about three quarters of an inch in length; and the letter being not indented, but raised, easily gives the impression, when, after being blacked with a glutinous ink, paper is closely pressed upon it. (See the article Printing.) A fount of letters includes small letters, capitals, small capitals, points, figures, spaces, and other necessary adjuncts. See Fount. Letter is a writing directed and sent by one person to another. See Epistle.\n",
      "The art of epistolary writing was considered by the Romans amongst the number of polite and liberal accomplishments; and we find Cicero mentioning, with great pleasure, in some of his letters to Atticus, the elegant specimen he had received from his son of his genius in this way. It seems indeed to have formed part of their education; and, in the opinion of Mr Locke, it well deserves to have a share in ours. The writing of letters enters so much into all the occasions of life, that no gentleman can avoid showing himself in compositions of this kind. Occurrences will daily force him to make this u\n",

      "one of the largest of the Hebrides, or Western Islands of Scotland, extending about eighty miles in length from north to south, and from thirteen to fourteen in breadth, consisting of a great number of isles and rocks, and parted by the sea into two divisions, called Lewis and Harris, the’ former lying to the westward of the latter. Lewis belongs to the county of Ross, is divided by several channels, distinguished by several names, and portioned out amongst different proprietors; but the Lewis, strictly so called, stretches out about thirty-six miles in length, from the northern point of Bowling Head to the southern extremity of Hussiness in Harris. The air is temperately cold, moist, and healthy; a great part of the low ground is flooded with lakes, and the rest is in some parts arable. Lewis is not so mountainous a region as Harris, but it is of as desert a character. Except along the margin of the sea, and in the immediate neighbourhood of Stornoway, the country is everywhere open, bare, brown, and uninteresting. The shores, particularly near the middle of the island, are deeply indented with arms of the sea, in which herrings and white fish are plentiful. A variety of streams, which issue often from small inland lakes, abound with trout and salmon. The grazing of cattle constitutes the chief means of support of the inhabitants. Lewis is divided into four parishes, viz. Barvas, Lochs, Stornoway, and Uig. There are a few scattered hamlets, but only one town, Stornoway, which lies on the east side of the island, at the head of a bay or harbour, to which it gives its name. It is a place of considerable size, and there are in it schoolmasters and missionaries for the instruction of the inhabitants. It is a singular fact, that the latter are of unmixed Danish origin, which is the case in none of the other islands. The population amounts to about 12,000.\n",
      "Lewis is the name of an instrument which is indented into a large stone, and has a ring for the purpose of making fast a rope, in order to move the stone, or to act as a stay. It is called in Italian ulivella, in French la louve, in German stein zange. The lewis consists of three wedges of iron, forming, when put together, a dovetail. The wedges are inserted into an equal and similar hollow dove-tail excavated in the stone. This hollow dove-tail is made exactly of the form and size of the lewis, and is a figure of six sides; a pair of vertical sides, which are opposite, equal, and parallel, and in form of truncated isosceles triangles; a pair of inclined sides, opposite equal rectangles, equally inclined to the axis of the hole, and not parallel. The top and base of the hole are rectangles parallel to each other, the base being longer than the top. The centre of the base and the centre of the top are in one vertical line. The form of the hole therefore is that of an inverted wedge with the point cut off; it is like a cavity fitted to contain the inverted keystone of an arch. When the iron dove-tail called the lewis is inserted into this hollow dove-tail made in the stone, the ring at the smaller and upper end of the iron dove-tail serves for making fast a rope, for the purpose of raising the stone. The constitution of the substance of timber enables the workman to fix a rope to it by merely inserting a screw or a spike into the log; stone will not admit of these, and is made fast by the contrivance of the lewis. The lewis of the most useful form, and that which is used in Britain, is represented at fig. A, Plate CCCXXL; a and b are two pieces of iron, in form of inverted wedges. These pieces are inserted into a quadrangular hole which is made in the stone. The two opposite and shortest sides of the hole are dove-tailed, or, in other words, under-cut, as represented at fig. B, which is a vertical section of the hole; t is the plan of the hole at top, o is the plan of the bottom of the hole. The hole, as represented in the figure, is five inches long at top, and six inches at bottom; the width is one inch; the depth seven inches. Sometimes the width is one and a half inch, and the depth four or five inches. The hole is made of such a size that the lewis fits exactly into it; a!, c', b , , are transverse geometrical views of the pieces «, c, b ; in the transverse views it is seen that the transverse sections of the parts of these pieces that enter the stone are of the same breadth from top to bottom. The piece c is represented with a perforation at top, for the purpose of taking out this piece more easily when the lewis is to be unshipped, but the lewis is usually made without this upper perforation. The pieces a, b, are first introduced into the hole, then is driven in c, which may either be a parallelepiped, or it may be a little thicker above, in form of a wedge; the ring m is then put on, and the bolt g h is passed through the holes of the ring and of the three pieces; the bolt enters at g, and forelocks at h. The tackle by which the stone is to be elevated is hooked on the ring m. This ring, in cases where a rope is to be passed through it, is bound round with cord, to prevent the rope from being chafed by the iron of the ring.\n",
      "Piranesi has proposed and figured some other forms of this machine in his Antichitò di Roma, but they do not appear to be so convenient as the lewis of the common form above described: one of the forms of lewis given by Piranesi is represented at fig. F. The two pieces which constitute the iron dove-tail open and shut by a joint; n is a bolt, which is put into the round hole at p after the instrument is inserted into the stone; this transverse bolt serves to keep the legs of the instrument spread out, so as to retain the form of the dove-tail. The lewis of the most usual form, represented at fig. A, and a lewis of another form, fig. G, are figured and described in Perrault’s Vitruvius, lib. X. chap. 2, and in the Theatrum Machinaru m ^ tab. XXXV. p. 111. In the lewis, fig. G, the iron dove-tail L has a ring at top, r, for receiving a rope; L is put into the dove-tailed hole in the stone, and then the two paral-lelopipeđal iron bolts e, u, are put in on each side of the iron dove-tail; e and u are of equal thickness throughout. The top of the hole must not be less than the bottom of the piece L, to the end that L may enter into the hole. The ring must not project beyond the lines which form the prolongation of the inclined sides of the wedge L; for if the ring projected, the pieces e, u, could not be put into the hole. The hole must be formed so that the machine may fit accurately into it.\n",
      "The lewis is used for raising large stones of several tons weight, in the building of harbours, bridges, and other solid fabrics, which, from the forces by which they are assailed, or on account of the long period they are designed to endure, require to be constructed of great masses of stone. Leupold, in his Theatrum Machinarum, mentions, that in many churches in Holland the pavöment consists of large slabs of stone or marble, each of them the size of a grave, and covering a burying-place; these slabs are laid close to one another, and join accurately, so that no lever or crow can be introduced into the joint to raise them; in each of the slabs there is a hole cut in form of a hollow dove-tail, and into this hole a lewis is introduced when occasion requires that the tomb should be opened.\n",
      "In the construction of harbours, the lewis fixed in a large stone frequently serves to make fast the ropes which stay the cranes. The lewis is commonly used in the docks at London for fixing mooring-rings in the stone: the ring is easily removed when requisite, by unshipping the bolt of the lewis; for this and other reasons it is found more convenient to employ the lewis for fixing rings, than to run the ring-bolt into the stone with melted lead.\n",
      "The largest stones that have been wrought and moved by the industry of man, occur in the buildings of the ancient Egyptians; but it is not ascertained whether their architects employed the lewis.\n",
      "Piranesi, in his Antichità di Roma, describes and figures lewis-holes existing in the upper surface of the large stones of the tomb of Caecilia Metella, at Capo di Bove, near Rome. The forcipes ferrei quorum dentes in saxa forata accommodantur, mentioned by Vitruvius (lib. x. cap. 2), denote a machine in the form of nippers, used to effect the raising of stones in the same way as the lewis; but the words seem to indicate a machine different in form from the lewis. Piranesi also observed in some ancient unfinished buildings, stones which appeared to have been raised by another method, namely, by knobs left on the front and side of the stone, to which knobs the ropes were attached. The knobs were taken off when the building was finished.\n",
      "Vasari relates, in his account of Brunalesco, that the use of the lewis was revived in Italy by that architect, who was well skilled in mechanics, and who constructed the cupola of the cathedral church of Santa Maria del Fiore, at Florence, about the year 1430; the first great cupola that was built in Europe, and which Michel Angelo had in view when he designed the cupola of St Peter’s. The lewis called Brunalesco’s is represented at fig. C, Plate CCCXXL Leo Baptista Alberti, a Florentine architect, who lived in 1440, in his treatise de Architectura, mentions the lewis by the Latin name of impleola. He describes the side wedges as having the figure of the letter D and from that form the machine had its Italian name ulivella, that is to say, little olive. Philander of Chatillon, in his Commentary on Vitruvius, published at Rome in 1544, gives a figure of the lewis used at Rome in his time, which resembles that used in England, and represented at figure A. In the Archaeologiae (vol. x.) there is a description of holes observed in the keystones of the Abbey Church of Whitby, which was built about 1370, in the reign of Edward III. as is supposed. These holes appear to have been lewis-holes; they are of th\n",

      "a maritime county of the province of Munster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the estuary of the Shannon and the county of Tipperary, on the east by the same county, on the south by the county of Cork, and on the west by that of Kerry. In extent of surface it ranks as tenth amongst the counties of Ireland. It contains 674,783 acres, of which 582,802 acres are fit for cultivation, and only 91,981 are bog or unprofitable mountain.\n",
      "It was formerly inhabited by the tribe of the Velaborii. The principal Irish families in it afterwards were the O’Briens, O’Gradys, O’Gormans, M'Enerys, M i Sheehys, Moronys, M t Mahons, and O’Quins. Much of it was confiscated in the time of Cromwell, since which period the proprietorship of the soil has mostly devolved upon settlers of English descent. The county is now divided into the ten baronies of Clanwilliam, Upper and Lower Conello, Coonagh. Coshma, Costlea, Kenry, Owneybeg, Pubble-brian, and Small County, which are again subdivided into 126 parishes.\n",
      "According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of the country, the county of Limerick comprehends portions of the dioceses of Limerick, Emly, Killaloe, and Cashel. The whole of the first named of these dioceses, a small portion excepted, is within the county; eighty-five of the parishes which constitute it being within its limits, and three only in the county of Clare. This see is one of the few which is unaffected by the changes introduced into the ecclesiastical divisions of Ireland by the late consolidation or the bishoprics. It is still, as before, to continue united with those of Ardfert and Aghadoe in Kerry. Its revenue is estimated at L.5369 per annum. The cathedral, an ancient and venerable pile, stands in the city of Limerick; and the bishop’s palace, a modern mansion, is situated on the bank of the Shannon, at the western extremity of the city. The chapter consists of a dean, precentor, chancellor, treasurer, and archdeacon, and has eleven prebendaries and six vicars-choral connected with it. The see of Emly, united with that of Cashel, has thirty-eight parishes in the county of Limerick, and twenty in that of Tipperary. The seat of the see is in the latter county. One parish of the diocese of Cashel, and two of that of Killaloe, are within the limits of the county of Limerick.\n",
      "The face of the country, though diversified by numerous small hills, is not mountainous, except on the southeast, where it is bounded by the Galtees, a ridge of considerable extent, and 2500 feet high at its most elevated point, extending into the adjoining county of Tipperary. On the borders of Kerry the surface also rises into a grand amphitheatre of low but steep mountains, that spread themselves out in a wide curve from Loghill to Drumcol-logh. The only river of any size is the Maig, which rises in the Galtees, and discharges itself into the Shannon west of Limerick. It is navigable by barges as far as the town of Adare. A plan to make this river available for the purpose of connecting the cities of Limerick and Cork, by an inland navigation from Adare to Mallow on the Blackwater, has not been carried into effect. The Feale and the Gale, which rise in the western mountain range, are considered as belonging to Kerry, and the Blackwater, which rises in the same range, to Cork. The county is well watered by numerous smaller streams. Its only lake is Lough Gur, about five miles in circumference, and studded with several small islands.\n",
      "The soil in the level parts is considered as the richest in Ireland. The Golden Vale, a district which obtained its name from the remarkable exuberance of its fertility, lies mostly in this county. Along the banks of the Shannon are large tracts of marsh land, called corcachs, also celebrated for their richness; a circumstance attributed to the quantity of alluvial mould deposited there by the Shannon when it overflows its banks. In a geological point of view the low country forms part of the great floetz limestone plain of Ireland; but the mountainous district in the south and west consists chiefly of sandstone. A mine of coal or culm is worked at Loghill, but it is found to be better adapted for kilns than for domestic use. At Castleconnel, a town beautifully situated, is a mineral spa of great celebrity from its sanative effects. It is of the same quality as the Poutron at Spa.\n",
      "The state of the population, at the different periods at which returns respecting it have been made, together with the authorities on which those returns depend, is as follows :—\n",
      "[table]\n",
      "The returns from the commissioners of public instruction in 1834, being made in dioceses instead of counties, cannot be rendered available in this and the subsequent 'statement. The return of 1831 gives an average of one inhabitant to every two acres and eighty-eight hundred parts of the county in general, and to every two acres and thirty-five hundred parts of that portion of its land which is capable of profitable cultivation.\n",

      "[table]\n",
      "Of the numbers in the latter of these statements, 2064 were Protestants of the established church, 27,735 were Roman Catholics, and 45 were dissenters; but the religious persuasion of 244 was not ascertained. The total number of selιools was 461; of which 27, affording education to 2841 children, were maintained by grants of public money; 29, educating 3274 children, were supported by the voluntary contributions of societies or individuals, and the remaining 405 schools, in which 24,040 children were educated, depended wholly on the fees of the pupils.\n",
      "The county returned eight members to the Irish parliament; two for the county at large, two for the city of Limerick, and two for each of the boroughs of Askeaton and Kilmallock. The boroughs having been disfranchised at the union, the number of representatives sent to the imperial parliament was fixed at three, two for the county and one for the city. The reform act has added one representative to the latter place.\n",
      "The land in the level parts is divided into large farms, many of which are almost exclusively devoted to grazing. In the more hilly region the farms are smaller, and in some parts cut up into holdings much too small for the profitable culture of the soil, or the comfortable support of the cultivators. Still, however, the agricultural produce is considerable. Wheat, barley, oats, and rape, are raised in large quantities. In the year 1709, a colony of Palatines brôught from Germany by Lord Southwell settled near Bruff, Rathkeale, and Adarc. They tended much to improve the state of agriculture, as also that of the linen manufacture. The rich lands on the borders of the rivers produce a kind of flax very different from that of the north; it grows to a great height, and is well adapted for sail-cloth. Hemp was formerly cultivated extensively on the lands of the same quality. The horses are of large size, strong, active, and generally well bred; the heaviest and fattest beasts slaughtered in the southern markets are reared in this county. The sheep are also of a good description, but they are not bred here. Hogs of large size are sent to the same markets. The exportation of cattle and grain is very considerable, constituting the main source of the wealth of the inhabitants. The Shannon, which here assumes the character rather of an estuary of the ocean than of an inland river, supplies marine fish, both round and flat, in great abundance. Pike, carp, tench, trout of large size, and salmon highly esteemed for its flavour, are caught in most of the rivers.\n",
      "The manners of the people are similar to those in other parts of the province. Their habits are almost exclusively agricultural. Their dwellings are poor, their food chiefly the potato; their fuel is turf, except near the collieries at Loghill, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the city, where British coal is much used. The Irish language is still spoken by the peasantry in their colloquial intercourse, but the English is universally understood and spoken, excepting perhaps in some of the more retired mountain districts.\n",
      "The county possesses many remains of antiquity. The most remarkable of the ancient monastic buildings are in the city of Limerick, where, besides the cathedral, there was a Dominican friary founded by Carbreagh O’Brien, king of Thomond, in which he was interred. Some remains of the monument erected to his memory still exist. In the same city was an Augustinian friary, a convent of black nuns, a Franciscan friary, and a preceptory of knights-templars, besides several other minor religious establishments. Amongst the most admired of the many fine monastic ruins in various parts of the county is the the abbey of Adare.\n",
      "The city of Limerick, the capital of the county, is situated on the Shannon, about 100 miles from its mouth, partly 7 on an island and partly on the main land. It is the third city in Ireland in population and importance, being surpassed in these respects only by Dublin and Cork. The number of its inhabitants in 1821 and 1831 was 59,045 and 66,575 respectively. The city consists of three principal divisions; the Irish town, the English town, and Newtown Pery. The first is the most ancient, having been built before the arrival of the English in 1172. The second occupies King’s Island, on the Shannon, and was formerly a strongly fortified position. The third was commenced in 1769, by Mr Sexton Pery, from whom it takes its name. It is laid out along the eastern banks of the river, in streets, intersecting each other at right angles with the utmost geometrical precision. The city was formerly considered as the strongest place in Ireland. In 1174 it was taken by the English, but shortly afterwards evacuated by them, and burned, to prevent its occupation being serviceable to the enemy. In 1651 it was taken by Ireton, Cromwell’s lieutenant-general, after a vigorous resistance; and in 1690, its garrison baffled the army of Ki ng W\n",

      "an English maritime county. It is bounded on the north by Yorkshire, on the east by the German Ocean and Norfolk, on the south by Cambridge, Northampton, and Rutland shires, and on the west by Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire. Its greatest length is seventy-three miles, and its greatest breadth fortyeight. The area is 2814 square miles, or about 1,800,000 acres.\n",
      "The county is divided into three districts or provinces. The largest of these, Lindsey, is more extensive than the other two, containing more than 1,000,000 acres, and stretching from the shores of the German Ocean to Nottinghamshire. It is rather an elevated tract of country, but the whole is so level as scarcely to contain a single hill. The north-eastern part of this division is a very extensive district of heathy land, generally very poor, especially the northern part of it, and denominated the Wolds. Though some parts of it have recently been brought into cultivation, yet a great portion has scarcely any other live stock than the numerous rabbits, which multiply in extended warrens. A small part, however, of this division, contains a rich tract of low land, formed by the rivers Trent, Dun, and Idle, where horned cattle are pastured, and some excellent flax is produced. The province of Lindsey is subdivided into fifteen hundreds and two sokes.\n",
      "The province of Kcsteven extends along the western side of the county, from its middle to its southern extremity; in which latter part is a portion of the fens. Notwithstanding there arc many extensive heaths, especially near Lincoln and Ancaster; and though the soil and elevation are various, yet on the whole it may properly be described as a fertile country. Towards the west a ridge of hills, which forms an abrupt boundary, extends from Grantham nearly to Lincoln; but none of the points attains a great elevation. This province is subdivided into nine hundreds and three sokes.\n",
      "The third province, Holland, contains the greater part of that unhealthy division of Lincolnshire usually called the Fens. It is subdivided into three hundreds, sometimes denominated sokes, sometimes wapentakes. The character of this province is similar to that of the province of the same name in the Netherlands, after which it has been called. Nearly the whole of it appears, at a remote period, to have been covered by the sea, and only brought into its present state of productiveness by the active and persevering labour of the inhabitants. The embankments and the draining have been expensive, perpetual, and progressive, and the soil that has been redeemed has conferred a most abundant remuneration. Excellent pasture land has been formed out of the swamps and bogs, and some of it produces extraordinary crops of corn, especially oats. Even in those parts that have not been reclaimed, the reeds, which abound, are converted into good covering for houses and barns, and they are well stocked with aquatic wild fowl. The taking of them is a profitable employment to many persons, and the markets of London are principally supplied from thence with those delicacies. The decoys in this district are more numerous than in any other part of England. They are commonly formed around quiet pools, to which pipes made of bent willows, and covered with nets, gradually enlarging as they approach the water, are conducted. Into the large orifice of the pipes the wild birds are enticed by tame ones trained for that business, and who conduct them into the funnel, when the appearance of a man or his dog behind drives them to the most contracted part, where they are taken. The quantity of birds taken in some seasons is prodigious, amounting to some hundreds of thousands. They usually consist of teal, widgeon, and wild ducks; but occasionally wild geese, godwits, coots, ruffs, and reeves and whimbrels, are caught. In these otherwise unproductive fens, the keeping of geese, principally for the sake of the feathers, is a considerable branch of rural industry, and supplies a large part of the demands of the kingdom, both for beds and for pens. The feathers are plucked from the birds at three, four, sometimes five different periods in the course of a year. This is thought a barbarous custom; but the charge of cruelty is denied by the breeders, who assert that, for their own profit, they pluck only those feathers which are so near falling off as to occasion little pain; those more firmly fixed, and which have some portion of blood at their end, being of very inferior value. The young ones are plucked as well as the old ones; experience having taught that, when plucked early, the future growth of the feathers becomes greater. During the breeding season, the birds are lodged in the same houses as their owners, in wicker pens, which are arranged in rows, frequently in the bed chambers. A gooseherd in attendance on the flock leads them daily to water, and assists them, on their return, to get into their several cells. The attendants are acquainted with each individual goose in the flock, and can commonly distinguish them by the tones of their voices. Near Spalding there is a considerable heronry, and a smaller one near Surflet, where the herons, like rooks, build their nests on high trees.\n",
      "The air in the fens is generally insalubrious, and the inhabitants suffer much from the nature of the water, which is generally of a brackish quality; and though they make reservoirs to preserve rain water, in dry summers they experience very great distress. In warm weather, vast swarms of insects add to the annoyances peculiar to this district.\n",
      "The population, according to the returns at the four decennial enumerations, appear to have amounted in 1801 to 208,557, in 1811 to 237,891, in 1821 to 283,053, and in 1831 to 317,400. The annual value of the real property, as taken in 1815, amounted to L.2,061,830.\n",

      "The reform bill has left the city of Lincoln, and the boroughs of Boston, Stamford, and Grantham, with two members each, as before. It has left Grimsby with only one; and has divided the county into two districts, one called the Part of Lindsey, and the other the Part of Kesteven and Holland. The polling places for the former are Lincoln, Gainsborough, Epworth, Barton, Brigg, Market Rosin, Louth, Spilsby, and Horncastle; and for the latter, Sleaford, Boston, Holbeach, Bourn, Donington, Navenby, Spalding, and Grantham.\n",

      "The fens of Lincolnshire have running through them wide ditches, which serve to drain the water from the land, and which, when united and extended, become navigable, and highly beneficial as means of conveying the productions to the various markets. The Foss Dyke, the earliest canal made in Britain, was constructed in the year 1121, to form a connection between the city of Lincoln and the river Trent; and though, from the nature of the soil, it has been often obstructed, and the expense of keeping it in order has been great, it has continued to be used from that time to the present day. The river Trent, though rising in Staffordshire, may be considered as a Lincolnshire river, from the principal navigation upon it belonging to this county. It receives the Dun and the Ouse, and, before reaching the sea, unites with the Humber. It is navigable for large barges to Gainsborough. It has, upon the influx of the tide, a most extraordinary bore, or, as it is provincially termed, eager, when the waters run up resembling a wall with a rapidity that has no equal in any of our English rivers, except the Wye at Cĥipstow. The Witham rises within the county, about ten miles from Stamford. The early part of its course is through a beautiful district till it reaches the fen country, when its course becomes sluggish; but being navigable to Boston, it is highly beneficial both for draining and for commerce. The other rivers are the Ancholme, the Welland, the Glen, the Grant, and the Ouse. The Humber, indeed, is its boundary on part of the northern side; but is more commonly and properly considered as a Yorkshire than a Lincolnshire river, from Hull, its principal port, being in that county. Two small canals communicate with the river Witham, one from Horncastle, and the other from Sleaford.\n",

      "which is supposed to be his earliest, has likewise been regarded as his most poetical composition. In the opinion of W’arton, the prologue to this poem evinces strong talents for high description and rich imagery. His Compìaynt, which is likewise addressed to the king, is a valuable and interesting production: it exhibits some lively sketches of the author’s personal fortunes, of the prevalent manners of the times, and of the early history of James the Fifth. The mode in which the tender age of this hopeful prince was corrupted by the designing profligacy of his attendants, is painted in striking colours; and although the information is conveyed in rhyme, it seems to be nearly allied to historical accuracy. James was possessed of superior talents, and of a disposition capable of receiving a virtuous direction; but his education was interrupted at a critical period, and he was early initiated in vice by those who by every tie of decency were bound to inculcate the lessons of virtue. The king was himself a lover of poetry, and his court was frequented by poets: Lindsay and Bellenden belonged to the royal household; and he had sufficient discernment to appoint Buchanan the tutor of one of his natural sons. From Lindsay’s “Answer to the Kingis Flyting,” it appears that James was a writer of verses: he begins by stating that he had read his majesty’s ragment, and proceeds to compliment him on his “ornate meter,”-proclaiming him the prince of poetry.\n",
      "The “Supplication directit to the Kingis Grace, in con-temptioun of side Taillis,” is at least conspicuous for the author’s zeal as a reformer of manners. He seems to have contemplated long trains and veiled faces with an unnecessary degree of alarm; but, like a good Christian, he recollected that a long train proceeds from pride, and pride from the devil. He is chiefly scandalized at observing nuns and other religious persons followed by train-bearers. Nor is he less offended with the “muzzled faces” of the ladies. The queen is the only female whom he proposes to exempt from the necessity of shewing her face and curtailing her gown. Kitteis Confession, another of his satirical poems, contains many happy strokes of humour. It is directed against auricular confession, a copious source of priestly influence; and the practice is exposed with equal pungency and good sense. The damsel remarks that her ghostly instructor gave her no injunctions to lead a holy life, and to confide in the merits of Christ, but only to follow certain external observances, of which she ventures to doubt the efficacy:\n",
      "Botgave me pennance ilk ane day, And Ave Marie for to say, And frydayis fyve na fische to eit— Bot butter and eggis ar better meit; And with ane plak to by ane messe Fra drunkin Schir Jhone Latynlesse.\n",
      "The sanctified lasciviousness of the father confessor is. depicted with no unskilful pencil. But the impurities of the Romish church were exposed to a more formidable attack, in “The Testament and Compiaynt of our So-verane Lordis Papingo;” a singular performance, in which he admonishes the king and his courtiers, and exposes the corrupt doctrines and vicious lives of the clergy. “In the course of the poem before us,” says Mr Warton, “an allegory on the corruptions of the church is introduced, not destitute of invention, humour, and elegance; but founded on one of the weak theories of Wickliffe, who, not considering religion as reduced to a civil establishment, and because Christ and his apostles were poor, imagined that secular possessions were inconsistent with the simplicity of the gospel.”^[18. Warton’s History of English Poetry, vol. iii. p. 149. ] But if we recollect what precious fruits both Wycliffe and Lindsay had seen produced by this civil establishment of religion, it is by no means wonderful that they should have adopted such a theory. The clergy enjoyed a very large proportion of the wealth of both kingdoms, and they doubtless exhibited different degrees of piety and learning; but it cannot be denied that their profligacy bore some proportion to their opulence, and that true and vital religion, that religion which affects the heart and influences the conduct, was in a great measure supplanted by idle and unavailing ceremonies. In the Tragédie of the Cardinall, this zealous reformer still prosecutes the same design. The plan of the poem bears some resemblance to that which was afterwards adopted in the Myrrour for Magistrates. As the author, after the hour of prime, is sitting in his oratory and reading the work of Boccaccio De Casibus Virorum illustrium, be suddenly perceives the figure of a wounded man, with pale visage and deadly cheer. This visitor, who proves to be the ghost of Cardinal Beaton, entreats him to commit his tragic story to writing; and on his assenting to this proposal, the woe-begone cardinal begins a relation of the principal events of his wicked life; but the story is not told with much elegance or energy.\n",
      "Lindsay has evinced his humour and good sense in ridiculing practices of another kind. One of the most barbarous usages connected with chivalry was the exhibition of tournaments, in which it frequently happened that the valiant knights displayed their courage and address at the expense of their lives; and the ladies of the middle ages attended these spectacles with nearly as little compunction as the ladies of the present age attend the representation of a tragedy at Drury Lane. It was however during the decline of chivalry that Lindsay produced his facetious account of “The Justing betwix Watsoun and Barbour.” He represents this justing to have taken place at St Andrews between two gentlemen of the king’s household: they are both described as adepts in physic; and as envy is apt to arise among those who follow the same calling, the subject of the poem was probably suggested by the feuds and jealousies which subsisted between these gentle leeches.\n",
      "One of the author’s most entertaining works is the Historie of Squyer Meldrum, which is to be considered as a tale of chivalry, although the champion and the poet flourished at the same period. Lindsay professes to have derived some part of his information from the hero of his story; and the romantic adventures of William Meldrum were yet fresh in the recollection of his countrymen. By assimilating him to the heroes of classical antiquity and of more recent romance, he has imparted to his work a certain air of fiction. With the romantic he has occasionally blended a sufficient mixture of the ludicrous. It is nevertheless to be presumed that much of his narrative is substantially true; and some parts of it can be verified from other authorities. After the exploits of his youth, the heroic squire fixed his residence in Fife, where he possessed an estate, and was appointed the deputy of Patrick Lord Lindsay, sheriff of that county. Here he is said to have administered justice in an exemplary manner, and to have dispensed physic as well as law to the poor. The desperate wounds which he himself had received directed his attention to the healing art; and as ardour was the essence of his character, he seems to have engaged in this new pursuit with his wonted enthusiasm. It is therefore evident that the squire was a person of a very singular character, and his exploits have furnished his friend, the knight of the Mount, with materials for a long and entertaining poem. In the course of his adventures, Meldrum arrives at a castle in Stratherne, and falls in love with its beautiful! owner, a young widow, who had been married to his own relation, apparently a cousin. Being conducted to his bedchamber, he continues to meditate on her charms, and at length begins to vent his passion in loud ejaculations: from her own apartment the lady overhears this soliloquy of her heroic guest, and speedily arrives at the conclusion that such ardent love ought to be duly requited. We learn from Lindsay of Pitscottie that she bore him two children, and their marriage was only deferred till they should obtain a dispensation from the pope; for her deceased husband was related to the squire within the prohibited degrees.^[19. In the civil law there were various fluctuations with respect to the marriages of cousins-german; and the reader, who is desirous of prosecuting such researches, will find ample information in the dissertation of Gothofredus, De Nuptiis Consobrinorum, subjoined tohis edition of Philostorgii Historia Ecclesiastica, Genevae, 1G43, 4to, and in Otto’s Dissertationes Juris Publici et Privati, p. 79. Traj. ad Rhen. 1723, 4to. The law of Justinian stood thus: “Duorum autem fratrum vel sororum liberi, vel fratris et sororis, jungi possunt.” (Inst. lib. i. tit. 10. § 4.) The canon law has adopted a different doctrine: prohibitions introduce the necessity of dispensations; dispensations increase the influence and the emoluments of the church. It even prohibits the marriage of third-cousins; and, as we have seen in the case of Squire Meldrum, extends its rule to affinity as well as consanguinity. To this discrepancy between the civil and the canon law, as Dr Wood has suggested, we may trace the origin of a vulgar notion, still prevalent in this kingdom, that first-cousins may marry, but second-cousins may not. (Institute of the Civil Law, p. 47.) In computing the degrees of consanguinity in the transverse line, the civil and the canon law follow very different methods. The rule of the civil law is, that there are as many degrees as persons, exclusively of the common stock; that of the canon law, that degrees of consanguinity are to be reckoned by the number of descents in one line; and where the lines are unequal, the canonist takes the longer of the two. The canon law prohibits marriages in the fourth, the civil law permits them in the same degree; or, in other words, the one law prohibits the marriages of third-cousins, and the other permits the marriages of first-cousins.

      "the collective name of a group of islands in the Mediterranean Sea, forming a part of the kingdom of Naples. They were known in the most remote ages as the Ephestiades, in the subsequent centuries as the AEolian Islands, and latterly have commonly borne the name of the most considerable of their number. According to the mythology of the heathens, they were imagined to be the chimneys of a vast subterraneous cavity, inhabited by Steropes, Brontes, and Argos; and the caverns in which AEolus confined the winds were in this archipelago. Here Diana was said to have been placed by Latona in her infancy, and here also Vulcan forged the thunderbolts of Jupiter.\n",
      "It is most probable that, at an early period, Liparus, the son of Auson, having passed from Italy with some of his followers, planted the largest of the islands, and conferred his name upon it. AEolus, the son of Hippotas, arrived afterwards, and marrying Cyane, the daughter of Liparus, succeeded to the throne; and being very attentive to meteorology, and often successfully predicting changes of weather, this may have given rise to the fabulous power attributed to him. This colony had suffered a decline, in spite of an augmentation of the inhabitants by the immigration of some Rhodians and Cnidians, when it was visited by some Etruscan pirates, who built the city of Lipari, and, by means of husbandmen transported from the continent, extended cultivation to the other islands. Since that period, they have been subject to Sicily, forming in Christian times a bishopric, restricted in 1394 to these islands. The whole of these islands exhibit the corrosive effects of gases and spray; but their western coasts, rising abruptly in precipitous masses, and shelving down gradually to the eastward, form an interesting geological feature, in which it agrees with the greater part of the West India and other islands. It is remarkable that, besides the western coasts of all these islands being steep and craggy, they have each of them a high isolated rock on their northern shores. The basis of the whole group is hornstone, with the various alterations and decompositions occasioned by volcanic influence; an influence easily traceable throughout these islands, in its grandest and wildest varieties.\n",
      "The climate is highly salubrious, and the weather generally soft and refreshing; but though there are a few trifling springs, a general scarcity of water is experienced, as the soil, consisting almost entirely of scoriae, tuffa, pumice, pozzolana, and ashes, without any intervening stony stratum, except occasional masses of obdurate vitrification, rapidly absorbs the moisture. The natives are consequently obliged to construct capacious cisterns, in which rainwater is preserved in a cool temperature. Most of the cattle are lean, and they are not abundant, as the pasturage is only adapted for the most part to the feeding of goats. The land is well cultivated, and yields grapes, currants, figs, prickly pears, corn, cotton, olives, and pulse, which latter grow under the cane trellises that support the vines. Violent rains sometimes cause great injury to the grounds, owing to their situation, and the friability of the soil; and at other times swarms of locusts greatly injure and diminish the produce. A large quantity of wine and currants is annually exported, and an active trade is carried on in bitumen, pumice, nitre, pozzolana, cinnabar, coral, and fish. At one period alum formed a considerable article of export, but it has decreased, probably owing to the diminished heat of the subterranean fires. Some sulphur is still shipped, but in less quantity than formerly, owing to a prejudice entertained by the inhabitants, that the vapour which arises from purifying it infects the air, and is injurious to vegetation.\n",
      "The inhabitants, who amount in all these islands to 22,350, are contented, temperate, and hardy, and are esteemed excellent sailors; but they are commonly considered as impertinent, mean, and immoral. They are by no means rich, but few are in extreme poverty; and, from leading an active life, they are healthy, except that, from their filthy habits, the itch is very prevalent amongst all classes. They are described as very expert slingers and throwers of stones, a valuable talent in an unarmed population, exposed to predatory visits from corsairs. The islands are variously enumerated, some stating them to be eight or nine, and others eleven. This has arisen from those who stated them at the greater numbers including some which are uninhabited, or may be considered as mere rocks belonging to adjacent islands.\n",
      "Isí, The island of Lipari is the largest and most populous of the whole group. It is accessible by a bay on the east side of the island, formed on the north by Monte Rosso, an immense mass of volcanic matter, and on the south by Cape Capistello, a rugged rock of lava. It is hilly, but intermixed with peculiarly beautiful and fertile valleys and plains, from which, amongst other produce, is supplied the Malmsey wine, whose flavour is admired in most parts of the world. The extent of the island is 110 square miles, and the population amounts to about 15,000 persons. Lipari has not suffered from volcanic eruptions for many ages, but its subterraneous fires are not yet extinguished; for, on digging in the central parts of the island to a trifling depth, heat, smoke, and a sulphureous smell, immediately arise. The highest mountain, St Angelo, contains a crater 200 feet wide; and on another mountain, Guardia, the course of the lava from an eruption is still visible. Lipari is literally the wreck of a vast conflagration, and affords perhaps the finest field in the world for the study of the geologist. This island contains the capital, the seat of government of the whole group. It is a city of the same name, situated on the south-east side; it has two havens, is the see of a bishop, and has a castle, a cathedral, and several other churches. It is healthy, though crowded, irregular, and filthy. It contains 12,500 inhabitants. Long. 14. 57.50. E. Lat. 38. 27. 56. N.\n",
      "2d, Volcano is a lofty island, fifteen miles in circuit, and possesses two small ports on the northern side. At a small distance from these ports is a hill, having a great crater, with a deep valley encircling, and detaching it from the neighbouring hills. It is about 2400 feet in height, but accessible to the summit with no little fatigue and some danger. The crater is a mile and a quarter in circumference, and nearly a quarter of a mile deep, forming an inverted elliptical cone, with the northern considerably higher and hotter than the southern side. The interior is full of volcanic scoriae, coaŧbd over with sulphur, alum, vitriol, and muriate of ammonia, diverging into every possible shade of brown, red, green, blue, orange, black, yellow, and white. From the numerous apertures in every part, a sulphureous and hydrogenous vapour rushes out in gusts, which, when collected on the sides, where a considerable quantity of sulphur has been deposited by sublimation, forms a species of stalactite, covered with boracic or other light efflorescences. The bottom is about two of three hundred yards in extent. There is a frequent explosion of gases, and a continued roar similar to that of a cataract, or of many anchor-smiths’ forges, which impress on the imagination the horrid feeling of being only separated by a frail crust from some vast abyss of central fire. Fire is only observable at night, when a pale lambent flame is seen to issue from many of the fissures, accompanied with nauseous fumes and vapours.

      "a city of Portugal, the metropolis of that kingdom, as well as of the province of Estremadura, in which it is situated. It is built on the banks of the river Tagus, which is a most secure and capacious harbour, well defended, and capable, of admitting 10,000 sail of vessels, without danger to them. The only difficulty is the bar at the entrance, which makes it hazardous either to enter or depart without the aid of skilful pilots. Between the bar and the city the strong castle of Belem, under whose guns all ships must pass, is a sufficient protection. Few finer objects can be seen than a panoramic view from the harbour of Lisbon. The smooth expanse of water studded with ships, the vineyards on the surrounding hills, interspersed with villas, and the magnificent city extending two miles along the shore, afford a coup ďoeil which has few equals.\n",
      "Lisbon is a city of great antiquity; it was known in remote periods by the name Ulyssippo,andits origin attributed to Ulysses. It was a municipium under the Roman government, and one of the favourite cities under the Moorish yoke. It was regained from the African marauders in 1154, by Alphonso, who had a few years before assumed the regal power, and who was assisted by a fleet of adventurers bound on a crusade to the Holy Land. Since that period it has continued the metropolis of Portugal, an independent kingdom, except from the year 1580 to 1640, when it was united to the Spanish monarchy.\n",
      "From the vicissitudes this city has experienced, we may expect to find it abounding in Phoenician, Roman, and Moorish antiquities; but the tremendous earthquake which it suffered in 1755 buried most of what then remained in a heap of ruins. After the dismal catastrophe of that period, the city rose again with unexampled rapidity, and with a beauty and splendour far exceeding its former condition. The traces of this calamity are not, however, wholly obliterated. Near the river, and the Praça di Commercio, large masses of ruined churches and convents are visible amongst the modern buildings; and the fractured strata of the rocks on which these stand, still show the nature of the concussion which destroyed the former city. This city seems exposed to this calamity, as there have been frequent shocks of earthquakes since; and indeed few years pass without some slight indications of a tendency in the earth to similar tremblemens. The streets of Lisbon are of competent breadth, and paved; but, owing to the inequality of the ground on which they stand, and their slippery state, they are uncomfortable to walk or ride through. The attention of a vigilant police is wanted to enforce a greater observance of cleanliness. As few of the Portuguese nobility reside on their estates, their residences within the city are very splendid; and some of the richer merchants have houses, 4 which in appearance rival those of the higher orders; but the habitations of the lower classes of the inhabitants are miserable and disgusting by their excessive filthiness.\n",
      "The public buildings are very spacious; and some of the few which sustained the concussion of 1755 exhibit fine specimens of ancient architecture. The church of Belem is one of these, and though two of the columns which supported the roof were then thrown down, and have since been replaced by two mis-shapen masses of modern masonry, it exhibits the finest specimen of the Arabesque-Gothic style of building. The royal palace is finely situated on the banks of the Tagus at Belem, but, being composed of wood, is not equal to the general taste of the other public buildings. The most imposing object near Lisbon is the aqueduct, which conveys fresh water to the city, and which in grandeur yields to no work of ancient or modern times. The cathedral is a large and magnificent building, and endowed with a revenue estimated at more than L.100,000 sterling annually.\n",
      "Lisbon is enriched with such establishments as usually adorn the capitals of kingdoms. It possesses an academy of sciences, a botanic garden, a well arranged cabinet of natural history, some public libraries, amongst which that of the Regalia contains upwards of 80,000 volumes, a college for the nobles, and several other seminaries. Amongst other charitable institutions, is an hospital, where the sick of all countries are freely admitted and relieved.\n",
      "The climate of Lisbon is remarkably salubrious, and is sought after by invalids from the more northern countries, for relief in pulmonary complaints. It is thought that the water drunk in this city has a tendency to alleviate these maladies. This water, which is brought from Montelavar by the aqueduct, is strongly impregnated with carbonate of lime, and, on analysis, is like the water of Clifton, but has a greater quantity of lime in a state of suspension.\n",
      "The markets of Lisbon are most profusely supplied with every article that can administer to human appetite. The consμmption of animal food is small, that of beef exceeding that of mutton in a very great degree; but, for the number of inhabitants, the quantity of animal food consumed in Lisbon is only one eighth of that which London requires to supply it. Fish, both from the sea and the rivers, is abundant and cheap. Fruit of every kind, and flour of excellent quality, are to be purchased; and garlic, which seems to be one of the articles in most extensive demand, is furnished in prodigious quantities.\n",
      "Before the great earthquake of 1755, the city of Lisbon was calculated to contain 150,000 inhabitants; but, by the census taken in 1804, the number amounted to 240,000. The removal of the court to Brazil did not diminish the population, but it has since declined, so that in 1830, by the last census, there were only 200,000, which, indeed, was both increased and enriched by this city having been during the peninsular war the focal point through which communication with the army was maintained, and the dépôt for the ammunition, provisions, and recruits, destined to support the forces employed in the interior of Spain and Portugal.\n",
      "There are few people in Lisbon occupied in manufactures. Some fine woollen cloths are made, some linens, and a quantity of silk goods more than equal to that of both the others. The greatest taste of this city is displayed in its jewellery business, in which, though rather tawdry than elegant, they excel. The goldsmiths and silversmiths are excellent workmen. As a specimen of the best faculties exercised in that branch, it deserves to be noticed, that the splendid service of plate presented to the Duke of Wellington by the government of Portugal was wholly made in Lisbon; and no person was permitted to execute the least part of the work who was not a native of the kingdom. This service, both for value and for the exquisite workmanship, is the first collection that was ever seen, and far exceeds that of any royal household in Europe.\n",
      "The foreign trade of Lisbon is second to no city in Europe excepting that of London. Its domestic productions, wine, oil, fruits, and bay salt, are conveyed to all the northern parts of the continent of Europe, but more especially to England, with which is the principal commerce. It receives in return from every country the articles in which it excels; from Russia, hemp, flax, and other naval stores; from the other parts in the Baltic Sea, linens, iron, steel, salted fish, timber, pitch, and tar; from Germany and Holland it obtains linens, corn, and some other commodities. England makes returns in cloths, linens, cotton, hardware, porcelain, and the various products of its looms, its forges, and its kilns. France supplies some linens, and the more fanciful articles of its tasteful industry. These varied commodities, received at Lisbon, are partly consumed in Portugal, whilst a very considerable proportion of them are destined for re-exportation to the transmarine settlements.\n",
      "The commerce of Lisbon is considerable with the Portuguese establishments in China, in India, and on both sides of the continent of Africa. The latter consists principally of such articles as are required to be given in exchange for human beings, in that abominable traffic denominated the slave-trade, but which deserves to be stigmatized as the commerce of cruelty and the stimulus to murder and barbarism. Brazil furnished for a long period the great rudiments oí the distant trade of Lisbon. Its sugars were distributed from hence to all the continental ports, where they obtained the name of the port at which they had first been received\n",

      "[table]\n",
      "in Europe. The cotton from that country, before the recent encouragements to its growth had given birth to its present enormous production, all centred in Lisbon; and it was the entrepôt for the gold, the silver, and the precious stones which the mines of Brazil yielded.\n",
      "The removal of the seat of the Portuguese government from the European metropolis to its American dominions, caused a great revolution in the commercial relations of both parts of the empire. Brazil, having quitted its colonial character, had its ports opened to the commercial ships of all nations; the transit trade of Lisbon was in some measure terminated; but the alteration communicated such a stimulus to Brazil, and its population, its wealth, and its productions, increased so much within the first ten years that elapsed after the emigration of the court, that, after allowing for what passed direct to and from Brazil in its intercourse with other countries, its transactions of commerce with Lisbon were as great as before the removal of the government.\n",
      "We have no authentic accounts of the foreign imports and exports; but some judgment may be formed from the eturns of the vessels that entered the port in the years, 1829, 1830, and 1831, as furnished by the British consul :—\n",
      "The average number of vessels, and their tonnage, which belonged to the port of Lisbon in the same three years, was, by the consular report, sixty ships, and of 9090 tons burden.\n",

      "called Lewchew by Mr Macleod, and by others Liqueo, or Lieoukiou. This group of islands is situated in the Eastern Ocean, to the south of Japan, about 400 or 500 miles east of the Chinese coast. They were little known to Europeans until they were visited by Captains Maxwell and Hall in the Alceste and Lyra in 1816, on their return from conveying Lord Amherst to China. Very full accounts have been published by Captain Hall and M$ Macleod of these islands, and of the climate and soil, as well as of the inhabitants, who appeared to these gentlemen to be extremely simple and interesting in their manners. These islands are in number thirty-six; but the only one of any great extent is the\n",
      "Great Loo-choo, which is thirty miles in length, and from twelve to fifteen in breadth. The climate is here a happy medium between the opposite extremes of heat and cold. Being situated in the middle of a vast ocean, these islands are refreshed by the sea breezes, which, blowing continually over them, produce an agreeable coolness. They are also well watered by small rivers and streamlets, which, rising in the central eminences, flow in different directions to the sea, and afford an abundant supply of excellent water. Being in the latitude of 26. N., the scenery, though not quite so rich, is, according to Captain Hall, even more pleasing to the eye than in countries nearer to the equator; the vegetation not being so luxuriant as to overload the landscape with foliage. The style of the landscape is on the whole decidedly tropical, though there is much variety; and the groves of pine trees 'give some parts of the country quite a European character. The orange and lime, the banyan of India, and the Norwegian fir, all thrive in Loo-choo. The mode of dressing the ground at Loo-choo is very neat, and resembles that of China, particularly in the process of manuring and irrigation. Tobacco, wheat, rice, Indian corn, millet, sweet potatoes, brinjals, and many other tropical vegetables, grow in great perfection at Loo-choo. Along the sides of the hills, and around the villages, the bamboo and rattan grow to a considerable size. But Captain Hall mentions that the pine was the most conspicuous tree which they observed on the island, rising to a great height and size. Some are forty feet in height, and three or four in girth. The cattle on this island are of a small black breed, and invariably used instead of horses for agricultural purposes. Hogs, goats, and poultry, with rice and a great variety of vegetables, form the chief food of the inhabitants, milk being seldom used. The English saw no geese on the island, nor sheep; but their horses, though very small and slender, were sufficiently strong for the natives. Their goats and pigs were also diminutive; but the poultry were large and excellent. These islands are not infested by any wild animals. They had no carts or wheeled carriages of any kind, all loads being carried by horses; and the roads, which are numerous, and generally kept in excellent order, measure generally from six to ten feet across.\n",
      "The whole coast of Loo-choo, as well as of the other islands, is encircled with coral reefs, which do not appear above water; and when the weather is calm, and their situation is not pointed out by breakers, they are exceedingly dangerous to mariners. The Alceste, Captain Maxwell’s ship, was several times in danger from these hidden rocks. This singular formation, which appears to be extending itself over the Pacific, was minutely examined by Captain Hall. After the sea has left it for some time, it becomes dry, and appears to be a compact rock; but no sooner does the tide rise again, and the waves begin to wash over it, than millions of coral worms, protruding themselves from holes in the surface, begin their operations; so that, from their prodigious numbers, the whole surface of the rock appears to be alive and in motion. These insects or worms cannot raise the rock above the surface of the water, and the level of the highest tide is accordingly the limit of the rock upwards, after which a horizontal field comes to be formed coincident with that plane, and perpendicular on all sides; and thus the reef, extending itself perpendicularly, and in all directions, becomes extremely dangerous to navigators. On the coast of Loo-choo there are several excellent harbours, particularly one, which is capacious and safe, and affords everywhere depth of water for the largest ships, with secure anchorage. Its banks consist of high rocks, overgrown with climbing plants and flowers.\n",
      "These islands are inhabited by a singular and apparently amiable people. They are of a diminutive stature, not exceeding in their average height above five feet two inches. But they are strong, well-made, and athletic; and in complexion they are quite as fair as the natives of Spain and Portugal. They invariably manifested towards their English visitors the most gentle, polite, and humane dispositions, but with that jealousy of them as strangers which is peculiar to China, Japan, and all the neighbouring countries. They were at first extremely averse to the landing of their visitors, and it was only after long deliberations that they were induced to concede the liberty of doing §o. But our people were confined to a small space on the sea-shore, under a burning sun; and it was only by renewed entreaties that they were allowed to extend their walks into the country. The’natives, however, very freely visited the English ships, and examined them carefully in all their equipmentsand detail. They accepted readily the hospitality of the strangers, and conformed to their manners in every thing. In their interviews they always showed a natural good breeding, bowing whenever they spoke to the English, uncovering their heads in their presence, and, in drinking, bowing to all around. After they had permitted the English to land, many visits were paid; but they never admitted the strangers into the interior of their town, and even limited their walks within a certain space. Any attempt to pass these bounds was always resisted by the sentinels; not, however, by force, but by a polite request, and by representing, that if the orders of the court were transgressed, blame would fall upon them. Some overtures were made by Captain Maxwell for an interview with the king; but these were always steadily resisted, on the ground or pretence that no embassy or letters were brought from the king of Eng-Iand, to whom, however, the king of Loo-choo wrote a letter, which was unfortunately lost in the wreck of the Alceste. It was extremely difficult to bring about any intercourse with this people. Ordinary requests were made the subject of tedious négociations; and the most ungracious feature in their character was their uniform aversion to any intimate communication with their visitors. In one particular they manifested a rigid adherence to Chinese manners; namely, in carefully withholding from the view of the Europeans their women, though the latter did not appear otherwise to be very closely confined. The practice of polygamy, which prevails in China, has no place here, and, the English were told, was even held in abhorrence. From the free intercourse also of the different sexes, the parties had opportunities of being acquainted before marriage.\n",
      "One of the most remarkable facts mentioned by Captain Hall is, that the natives of these islands were unacquainted with the use of fire-arms. From all that the English could observe, they were even ignorant of the use of money; and though those amongst the natives who had visited China must have seen the currency of that country, yet none of them showed any desire to possess Spanish dollars or gold coins, nor could it ever be learned whether they were in possession of any common medium of exchange. With regard to their want of arms, it is supposed by Mr Macleod, that the Chinese, after conquering, had disarmed them. The musketry and cannon of the English were objects of great wonder to them; and when they saw Captain Maxwell bring down a bird on the wing, they were shocked and terrified, and requested that fire-arms should not be again brought into the island. When Napoleon was informed, at St Helena, that these people had neither arms nor money, he ridiculed the idea as incredible and absurd, and affirmed that the English had been imposed on. The result justified his penetration. These people are well acquainted with both; and it is now known that, notwithstanding all their fair seeming, they are about the most remorseless pirates in the Yellow Sea. In their intercourse with our people, however, they were remarked for their honesty; insomuch, that though they were freely admitted on board of the English ships, and many valuable articles were often in their way, yet nothing was ever missed.\n",
      "They appear to live on social and friendly terms with one another, and have frequently pic-nic parties in the fields, the dinner being carried about in little japanned boxes, with sliding drawers, fastened to the end of a bamboo. They entertained the English at dinner; and the meal consisted of hard-boiled eggs coloured and sliced, fish dried in butter, sliced junk smoked, sliced pig’s liver; then came tea, which was succeeded by an unpalatable dish of coarse, soft, black sugar, wrapped up in unbaked dough. Cakes in various shapes, with something like cheese, completed the entertainment; the intervals being filled up with drinking sackee, and with smoking.\n",
      "The Loo∙chooans appear to have made no progress in science or literature, though several individuals amongst them were distinguished by the English for their intelligence, and turn for inquiry. Their language is a dialect of the Japanese; but they have Chinese books, which are studied by the learned. Their religion seems to resemble the superstition of China; but it is remarkable that the order of priests, who are generally objects of veneration in all countries, are here consi\n",

      "a maritime county in the province of Leinster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the county of Down and the bay of Carlingford, on the east by the Irish Sea, on the south by the county of Meath, and on the west by the counties of Meath and Monaghan. It is the smallest county of Ireland, comprising only 200,484 acres, of which 185,568 are capable of cultivation, and 14,916 are bog or unprofitable mountain.\n",
      "In the time of Ptolemy it formed part of the maritime district inhabited by the Voluntii. Afterwards it was known by the name of Argiall, Orgiall, or Uriell, which also comprehended the greater part of the counties of Meath, Monaghan, r and Armagh. Its leading families of Irish extraction were the O’Carrols and the M t Scanlans∙ It was conquered by the English under De Courcy in his progress northwards to Ulster, and formed one of the twelve counties into which King John divided that part of Ireland which acknowledged his authority. It is now divided into the five baronies of Ardee, Upper and Lower Dundalk, Ferrard, and Louth, which are subdivided into sixty-one parishes, all in the archdiocese of Armagh, and two parts of parishes in the diocese of Clogher.\n",
      "The southern part of the county is flat, diversified by gentle undulations of the surface. Proceeding northwards it becomes more hilly, until, at its most northern extremity, it rises into the mountains of Ravensdale and Carlingford, of considerable elevation. The rivers are the Dee, the Clyde, the Fane, and the Castletown. None of them are navigable, being useful solely for irrigation, and other purposes of rural economy. The Boyne forms part of the southern boundary of the county. It is navigable for large vessels as far as Drogheda. The county has a considerable line of sea-coast, consisting chiefly of a sandy strand, except where it is broken by the projection of Clogher Head, a bold promontory, on which is a fishing town of the same name. The bay of Dundalk extends beyond this point for seven miles at its mouth, indenting the coast for an equal distance inland. It*is considered as peculiarly dangerous for shipping. The Carlingford Mountains, which bound the northern extremity of the county, separate it from the bay that takes its name from them. This latter bay, which forms the line of demarcation both between the counties of Louth and Down and the provinces of Leinster and Ulster, is deep and narrow, extending in length upwards of nine miles, with an average breadth of a mile and a half. It is navigable nearly to the town of Newry, and its shores on both sides are much admired for their bold and picturesque scenery. An oyster, in high estimation amongst gastronomes Jbr the peculiar delicacy of its flavour, is found in this bay.\n",
      "The soil in the southern lowlands is well adapted for tillage, being composed of a rich vegetable mould resting on marl or on limestone, sometimes with a substratum of l slate. The quality of the soil diminishes in agricultural value as the land rises towards the north, and the summits of the mountainous district produce only heath and scanty herbage.\n",
      "The mountains are composed chiefly of granite. On their borders hornblende and primitive greenstone are bund in abundance, after which are exterior ranges of transition rock. The lower lands are of the clay-slate for-nation. The line of separation between the granite and the ⅛y-slate extends from Carlingford Bay, over the summit .>f the Ravensdale Mountains, into the county of Armagh. ?loetz limestone appears in the neighbourhood of Drog-ιeda and Ardee. A lead mine was worked for a short Period at Salterstown, near the sea-coast. There is a mineral spring at Ballymascanlan.\n",

      "The county, though the smallest in Ireland, sent no fewer than twelve representatives to the Irish parliament, \"wo were returned for the county, two for the town of '⅛rogheda, and two for each of the boroughs of Dundalk, ιrdee, Carlingford, and Dunleer.

      "Of the number stated in the latter of these returns, Í81 were of the Established Church, 5664 were Roman tholics, and ninety-five Dissenters; the religious per-ιsion of thirty-six was not ascertained. The total num- ∣r of schools was 169, of which twenty-one, affording <iucation to 1358 children, were supported by grants of public money; twenty, affording education to 1106, were supported by the voluntary contributions of societies or individuals; and the remaining 128, in which 4512 children received instruction, were supported wholly by the fees of the pupils. There is an endowed classical school at Dundalk, on the endowment of Erasmus Smith.\n",
      "The lands capable of cultivation are mostly kept in tillage. Potatoes, wheat, oats, and barley, raised according to the succession here stated, form the principal crops. In the northern districts, oats are chiefly raised. The systems generally adopted are those of the most approved kind, as are also the implements employed. From the attention paid to introduce the best breeds of cattle of every denomination, the different species cannot now be easily distinguished. Sheep are most abundant in the hilly districts. Many parts of the county are well planted; the neighbourhood of Collon particularly exhibits a fine specimen of the attention paid by its proprietor to this mode of improving and embellishing the country. The ash-tree grows in the lower grounds to a great size. The coasts furnish a constant supply of fish; and the flat shores abound with sea-fowl, especially barnacle, which, however, is not so highly esteemed for flavour as that of Wexford or Derry. The manufacture of coarse linens is carried on to a considerable extent, and latterly the cotton manufacture has gained ground.\n",
      "The appearance of the dwellings of the peasantry in the smaller towns and villages indicates a considerable degree of comfort. In the hilly and more remote districts it deteriorates considerably. In their manners, food, and clothing, they differ in no respect from those of the neighbouring portions of Leinster and Ulster. Fuel is scarce, except in the vicinity of the sea-ports, into which English and Scotch coal is imported.\n",
      "Few counties can boast of so many remains of antiquity. There are two round towers, one at Monasterboice, 110 feet in height, and in a state of excellent preservation; the other at Dromiskin, much decayed. At the former of these places there are also the remains of two chapels, and of two finely-sculptured crosses, one of them eighteen feet high. Near the banks of a stream called the river of Bal-richan, is a large artificial cave, accidentally discovered by the sinking in of a horse whilst ploughing. It consists of several narrow passages, the sides and top of which are formed of flag-stones. Some bones of large and small animals were found in it. About two miles from Dundalk are the ruins of a very ancient structure, which has some resemblance to the hull of an ancient galley. There are no traces of doors, windows, or loop-holes. The building has given rise to much antiquarian discussion. At Ballymascanlan is a cromleach called the Giant’s Load. It consists of a rock twelve feet long and six broad, elevated on three upright stones. Near it is Castle Rath, surrounded by moats and lesser raths, and with a remarkable tumulus in its vicinity. The great mound of Castleguard, near Ardee, is ninety feet in height, and 600 feet in circumference at its base. Its summit terminates in an area 140 feet round. It is well planted, and surrounded by a deep trench. At Faughart are the remains of an ancient intrenchment. The decisive battle which terminated in the defeat and death of Edward Bruce, by Sir John Bermingham, afterwards Lord a Louth, was fought near this place. The remains of castles are numerous. That of Carlingford, built by King John, occupies a commanding position on a rock projecting into the bay. Castletown stands within sight of the town of Dundalk. Terfeckan Castle, once the residence of the learned Archbishop Usher, is now utterly in ruins. The county is equally remarkable for the number of its ancient monastic edifices. Mellifont, a Cistertian abbey, five miles west of Drogheda, presents some remains equally remarkable for their beauty and singularity of architecture. Others are to be traced at Carlingford, Faughart, and Monasterboice.\n",

      "in the enlarged sense of the word, denotes all those affections of the pleasing kind which objects and incidents excite in our minds. Thus we are said to love not only intelligent agents of morally good dispositions, but also sensual pleasures, riches, and honours.\n",
      "But love, in its usual and more appropriate signification, may be defined, “that affection which, being compounded of animal desire, esteem, and benevolence, becomes the bond of attachment and union between individuals of the different sexes, and makes them enjoy in the society of each other a species of happiness which they experience nowhere else.” We call it an affection rather than a passion, because it involves a desire of the happiness of its object; and that its constituent parts are such as have just been enumerated we shall first endeavour to prove, and then proceed to trace its rise and progress from a selfish appetite to a generous sentiment.\n",
      "Mere animal desire has nothing in view but the species and the sex of its object; and before it makes a selection, it must be combined with sentiments very different from itself. The first sentiment with which it is combined, and by which a man is induced to prefer one woman to another, seems to be that by which we are delighted with gracefulness of person, regularity of features, and beauty of complexion. It is not indeed to be denied that there is something irresistible in female beauty. The most severe will not pretend that they do not feel an immediate prepossession in favour of a handsome woman; but this prepossession, even when combined with animal desire, does not constitute the whole of that affection which is called love. Savages feel the influence of the sensual appetite, and it is extremely probable that they have some ideas of beauty; but amongst savages the affection of love is seldom known. Even amongst the lower orders of society it seems to be a very gross passion, and to have in it more of the selfishness of appetite than of the generosity of esteem. To these observations many exceptions will no doubt be found;^[1. Such as that of the negroes whose story is so pathetically told by Addison (Spectator, No. 215); the two lovers who were killed by lightning at Staunton-Harcourt (Pope’s Letters) ; and many others which will readily occur to every reader. ] but we speak of savages in general, and of the great body of the labouring poor, who, in the choice of their mates, do not study, and indeed are incapable of studying, that rectitude of mind, and those delicacies of sentiment, without which neither man nor woman can deserve to be esteemed.\n",
      "In the savage state, and even in the first stages of refinement, the bond of union between the sexes seems to consist of nothing more than mere animal desire and instinctive tenderness for their infant progeny. The former impels them to unite for the propagation of the species, and the latter preserves the union until the children who are the fruit of it be able to provide for their own subsistence. That in such unions, whether casual or permanent, there is little mutual esteem and benevolence, is apparent from the state of subjection in which women are held in rude and uncultivated nations, as well as from the manner in which marriages are contracted.\n",
      "Sweetness of temper, a capital article with us in the female character, displays itself externally in mild looks and gentle manners, and is the first and perhaps the most powerful inducement to love in a cultivated mind. “But such graces,” says Lord Kames, “are scarce discernible in a female savage, and even in the most polished woman would not be perceived by a male savage. Among savages, strength and boldness are the only valuable qualities. In these, females are miserably deficient; for which reason they are contemned by the males, as beings of an inferior order. The North American tribes glory in idleness; the drudgery of labour degrades a man in their opinion, and is proper for women only. To join young persons in marriage is accordingly the business of the parents; and it would be unpardonable meanness in the bridegroom to show any fondness for the bride. In Guiana a woman never eats with her husband, but after every meal attends him with water for washing; and in the Caribbee islands she is not even permitted to eat in the presence of her husband. Dampier observes in general, that among all the wild nations with which he was acquainted, the women carry the burdens, while the men walk before and carry nothing but their arms; and that women even of the highest rank are not better treated. In Siberia, and even in Russia, the capital excepted, men, till very lately, treated their wives  in every respect like slaves. It might indeed be thought that animal desire, were there nothing else, should have 'raised women to some degree of estimation among men; but male savages, utter strangers to decency and refinement, gratify animal desire with as little ceremony as they do hunger or thirst. Hence it was that in the early ages of society a man purchased a woman to be his wife, as one purchases an ox or a sheep to be food; and valued her only as she contributed to his sensual gratification.”\n",
      "But if amongst savages and the vulgar, love be unknown, it cannot possibly be an instinctive affection; and therefore it may be asked how it gets possession of the human heart, and by what means we can judge whether in any particular instance it be real or imaginary. These questions are of importance, and deserve to be fully answered, though many circumstances conspire to render it no easy task to give to them such answers as may be perfectly satisfactory. Love can subsist only between individuals of the different sexes. A man can hardly love two women at the same time; and we believe that a woman is still ess capable of loving at once more than one man. Love, therefore, has a natural tendency to make men and women pair, or, in other words, it is the source of marriage; jut in polished society, where alone this affection has any )lace, so many things besides mutual attachment are ne- >essary to make the married life comfortable, that we rare-y see young persons uniting from the impulse of love, and ιavc therefore but few opportunities of tracing the rise, )rogrcss, and consequences of the affection. We shall, ιowcver, throw together such reflections as have occurred ,o us on the subject, not without indulging a hope that hey may be useful to the younger part of our readers vhen forming the most important connexion in life.\n",
      "Wc have said that the perception of beauty, combined vith animal desire, is the first inducement which a man :an have to prefer one woman to another. It may be ιdded, that elegance of figure, a placid masculine counte-ιance, with a person which indicates strength and agility, .re the qualities which first tend to attach any woman to I particular man. Beauty has been defined by Buffier, í that particular form which is the most common of all articular forms to be met with in the same species of seings.” Let us apply this definition to our own species, 1 nd try, by means of it, to ascertain what constitutes the ⅛eauty of the human face. It is evident, that of countenances we find a number almost infinite of different forms; ∣f which, however, one only constitutes beauty, whilst the est, however numerous, constitute what is not beauty, ut deformity or ugliness. To an attentive observer, .owcver, it is evident, that of the numerous particular jrms of ugliness, there is not one which includes so many ices as are formed after that particular cast which con-titutes beauty. Every particular species of the animal s well as the vegetable creation may be said to have a xed or determinate form, to which, as to a centre, nature ∣L continually inclining. Or it may be compared to pen- .ulums vibrating in different directions over one central oint; and as they all cross the centre, though only one l asses through any other point, so it will be found i hat perfect beauty is oftener produced by nature than eformity; we do not mean than deformity in general, ut than any one kind and degree of deformity. To ini tance in a particular part of a human feature; the line ∕hich forms the ridge of the nose is deemed beautiful I /hen it is straight; but this is likewise the central form, I zhich is oftener found than any one particular degree of i oncave, convex, or any other irregular form that may be I imposed. As we are then more accustomed to beauty han deformity, we may conclude that that is the reason zhy we approve and admire it, just as we approve and admire fashions or dress for no other reason than that we are used to them. The same thing may be said of colour as of form. It is custom alone which determines our preference of the colour of the Europeans to that of the Ethiopians, and which makes them prefer their own colour to ours; so that though habit and custom cannot be the cause of beauty, they are certainly the cause of our liking it.\n",
      "That we do like it cannot be denied. Every one is conscious of a pleasing emotion when contemplating beauty either in man or woman; and when that pleasure is combined with the gratification of the sensual appetite, it is obvious that the sum of enjoyment must be greatly increased. The perception of beauty, therefore, necessarily directs the energy of the sensual appetite to a particular object; but still this combination is a mere selfish feeling, which regards its object only as the best of many similar instruments of pleasure. Before it can deserve the name of love, it must be combined with esteem, which is never bestowed but upon moral character and internal worth; for let a woman be ever so beautiful, and of course ever so desirable as an instrument of sensual gratification, if she be not possessed of the virtues and dispositions which are peculiar to her sex, she will inspire no man with a generous affection. With regard to the outlines, indeed, whether of internal disposition or\n",

      "His father was the author of some very respectable pub-ications in refutation of Mandeville and other sceptical writers; and he had the means of giving his son an excellent education, although he found it convenient to establish him in a commercial engagement, which principally occupied the first forty-six years of his life, without any other interruption than that which was occasioned by some journeys of business into the neighbouring countries, and a few scientific excursions among the Alps. During these, however, he collected by degrees, in conjunction with his brother William Antony, a splendid museum of mineralogy, and of natural history in general, which is still preserved at Geneva by the younger Deluc, his nephew. He at the same time took his share of the public business of the state, as one of the council of Two Hundred; and he is still remembered with respect by his fellow citizens, though he revisited them but once, and hat for a few days only after his emigration, which was the consequence of some unexpected misfortunes in commerce. He bore them with fortitude, and he rather rejoiced than lamented at the change of his pursuits, when ιe removed to England in 1773. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society in the same year, and was appointed leader to the queen; a situation which he continued to told for forty-four years, and which afforded him both leisure and a competent income. In the latter part of his life he obtained leave to perform several tours in Swit-erland, France, Holland, and Germany. In this last country he passed six years, from 1798 to 1804; and after his return he undertook a geological tour through England. When he was at Göttingen, in the beginning of his Ger man tour, he received the compliment of being appointed honorary professor of geology in that university; but he never entered upon the active duties of a professorship. He was also a correspondent of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and a member of several other scientific associations.\n",
      "His favourite studies were geology and meteorology. The situation of his native country had naturally led him to contemplate the peculiarities of the earth’s structure, and the properties of the atmosphere, as particularly displayed in mountainous countries, and as subservient to the measurement of heights. He inherited from his father a sincere veneration for the doctrines of Christianity, and a disposition to defend the Mosaic account of the creation, against the prevailing incredulity of the age. His royal patroness was most anxious to encourage and promote his labours in this field; and he is universally allowed to have had great success in removing the specious objections which had been advanced by his antagonists, against the comparatively recent formation of the present continents. The testimony of Cuvier is sufficient to establish his character in this capacity, and to place him, at the same time, in the first rank of modern geologists. His original experiments relating to meteorology are, however, not less valuable to the natural philosopher; and he discovered many facts of considerable importance relating to heat and moisture. He noticed the disappearance of heat in the thawing of ice, about the same time that Black founded on it his ingenious hypothesis of latent heat. He ascertained that water was more dense about forty degrees of Fahrenheit than at the temperature of freezing, expanding equally on each side of the maximum; and he was the original author of the opinion since re-advanced by Mr Dalton, that the quantity of aqueous vapour contained in any space is independent of the presence or density of the air, or of any other elastic fluid; though it appears difficult to reconcile this opinion with some of the experiments of our author’s great rival, Saussure, a philosopher who, as he very candidly allows, made, in many respects, more rapid progress in hygrometry than himself. Deluc’s comparative experiments on his own hygrometer, and on Saussure’s, show only that both are imperfect; but it may be inferred from them, that a mean between both would in general approach much nearer to the natural scale than either taken separately. It appears also probable that Saussure’s is rather less injured by time than Deluc’s, which has been found to indicate a greater degree of mean moisture every year than the last.\n",
      "Deluc was a man of warm feelings, and of gentle and obliging manners, fulfilling on all occasions the various duties of a husband, a father, a master, and a friend; at the same time that his literary and scientific merits, and his unremitting attention to the service of the queen, insured her respect and her kindness. He saw her daily for many years, and in his last illness, which was long and painful, she showed him repeated marks of benevolent regard. He died at Windsor on the 7th of November 1817, leaving a variety of works, which will long be remembered in the scientific world.\n",

      "weary at length of his retirement, re-appeared puιlicly at Wittemberg, upon the 6th of March 1522. This hlid without the elector’s leave, but he immediately wrote Frçlerick a letter to prevent his taking it amiss. The edict o≡harles V., severe as it was, had given little or no check tJLuther’s doctrine; for the emperor had no sooner retried to Flanders than his edict was neglected, and the nl doctrine seemed to spread even faster than before. InLuther’s absence, Carolostadius had pushed on things fair than his leader; he had attempted to abolish the use oígass, to remove images out of the churches, to set aside aι⅛ular confession, invocation of saints, and the abstaining fr⅛ meats; he had allowed the monks to leave their mo- n⅛ries, to violate their vows, and to marry; in a word, hc⅛ad quite changed the doctrine and discipline of the clwch at Wittemberg; all which, though not against Luthes sentiments, was yet blamed by him, as being rashly ar>unseasonably done. Lutheranism was still confined to G∣∙nany. It had not yet extended to France; and Henry V∣(. of England passed the most rigorous acts to prevent it⅛om invading his realm. Nay, he did something more. Tfshow his zeal for religion and the holy see, and perhaps als to exhibit his skill in theological learning, he wrote a tr'etise on the Seven Sacraments, against Luther’s book on ∣⅛ptivity of Babylon, which he presented to Leo X.\n",
      "tober 1521. The pope received it very favourably, ras so well pleased with the king of England, that mplimented him with the title of Defender of the . Luther, however, paid no regard to his rank as a so-jn, but answered him with great sharpness, treating ιis person and performance in the most contemptuous er. Henry complained of Luther’s rude usage of him princes of Saxony; and Fisher, bishop of Rochester, d to his answer, in support of Henry’s treatise; but >r the king’s complaint, nor the bishop’s reply, was led with any visible effects.\n",
      "ther, though he had put a stop to the more direct and t proceedings of Carolostadius, now made open war he pope and bishops; and, that he might induce the î to despise their authority, he wrote one book against ipe’s bull, and another against the order called the • of Bishops. The same year, 1522, he wrote a letter, the 29th of July, to the assembly of the states of Bo- ⅛ in which he assured them that he was labouring to ish their doctrine in Germany, and exhorted them i return to the communion of the church of Rome; he same year he also published a translation of the Testament in the German tongue, which was aftercorrected by himself and Melancthon. This transhaving been several·times printed, and having passed in⅛l≡ very body’s hands, Ferdinand, archduke of Austria, the em⅛ror ’ s brother, issued a severe edict, to prevent the fur-thrpublication of it; forbidding all the subjects of his impel d majesty to have any copies of it, or of Luther’s other boils, in their possession. Some other princes followed his cx⅜ρle, and Luther was so incensed that he wrote a trea-tisfe'on the secular power, in which he accused them of tyikny and impiety. The diet of the empire was held at N∣pmberg, about the end of the year, and to it Adrian VI. se≡his brief, dated the 25th of November; for Leo X. had died upon the 2d of December 1521, and Adrian had been elected pope upon the 9th of January following. In this brief he observes, amongst other things, to the diet, how he had heard with grief, that Martin Luther, after the sentence of Leo X. which had been ordered to be executed by the edict of Worms, continued to teach the same errors, and daily to publish books full of heresies; that it appeared strange to him, that so large and so religious a nation could be seduced by a wretched apostate friar; that nothing, however, could be more pernicious to Christendom; and therefore he exhorted them to use their utmost endeavours to make Luther, and the authors of these tumults, return to their duty, or, if they refused and continued obstinate, to proceed against them according to the laws of the empire, and the tenor of the last edict.\n",
      "The resolution of this diet was published in the form of an edict, upon the 6th of March 1523; but it had no effect in checking the Lutherans, who still went on with undiminished boldness and confidence. This year Luther wrote a great many pieces, amongst which was one upon the dignity and office of the supreme magistrate, which Frederick, elector of Saxony, is said to have been highly pleased with. About the same time he sent a writing in the German language to the Waldenses in Bohemia and Moravia, who had applied to him about worshipping the body of Christ in the Eucharist. He also wrote another book, which he dedicated to the senate and people of Prague, concerning the institution of ministers of the church; and he drew up a form of saying mass. He wrote a piece entitled An Example of Popish Doctrine and Divinity, which Dupin calls “a satire against nuns, and those who profess a monastic life.” He also wrote against the vows of virginity, in his preface to his commentary on 1 Corinthians, chap, viii.; and his exhortations were, it seems, followed with effects, for soon afterwards, nine nuns, amongst whom was Catharine de Bore, eloped from the nunnery at Nimptschen, and were brought, by the assistance of Leonard Coppen, a burgess of Torgau, to Wittemberg. Whatever offence this proceeding mightgive to the Catholics, it was highly extolled by Luther, who, in a book written in the German language, compares the deliverance of these nuns from the slavery of a monastic life, to that of the souls which Jesus Christ had delivered by his death. This year Luther had occasion to canonize two of his followers, who, as Melchior Adam relates, were burned at Brussels in the beginning of July, and were the first who suffered martyrdom for his doctrine. He likewise wrote a consolatory epistle to three noble ladies at Misnia, who had been banished from the Duke of Saxony’s court at Friburg for reading his books.\n",
      "In the beginning of the year 1524, Clement VII. sent a legate to the German diet, which was to be held at Nuremberg. Adrian VI. had died in October 1523, and, on the 19th of November, been succeeded by Clement. A little before his death, he canonized Benno, who had been bishop of Meissen in the time of Gregory VII. and one of the most zealous defenders of the holy see. Luther, imagining that this was done directly to oppose him, drew up a piece entitled Against the New Idol and Old Devil set up at Meissen; a production in which he treats the memory of Gregory with great freedom, and does not spare even that of Adrian. The legate of Clement VII. represented to the diet of Nuremberg the necessity of enforcing the execution of the edict of Worms, which had been strangely neglected by the princes of the empire; but, notwithstanding the legate’s solicitations, which were very pressing, the decrees of the diet were thought so ineffectual, that they were condemned at Rome, and rejected by the emperor. In this year began the dispute between Luther and Erasmus, about free-will. Erasmus had been much courted by the Catholics to write against Luther; but he was all along of opinion that writing would not be found an effectual way to terminate the differences, and re-establish the peace of the church. However, overcome by the importunities of the pope and the Catholic princes, and desirous at the same time to clear himself from the suspicion of favouring a cause which he would not seem to countenance, he resolved to write against Luther, though, as he tells Melancthon, it was with some reluctance, and chose the subject of free-will as his theme. His book was entitled a Diatribe or Conference about Free-will, and was written with much moderation, and without personal reflections. In the preface, he tells Luther “that he ought not to take his dissenting from him in opinion ill, because he had allowed himself the liberty of differing from the judgment of popes, councils, universities, and doctors of the church.” Luther was some time before he answered Erasmus’s book, but at last he published a treatise De Servo Arbitrio, or of the Servitude of Man’s Will; and though Melancthon had promised Erasmus that Luther should answer him with civility and moderation, yet Luther had so little regard to Melancthon’s promise, that he never wrote any thing more severe. He accused Erasmus of being careless about religion, and little solicitous what became of it, provided the world continued in peace; and that his notions were rather philosophical than Christian. Erasmus immediately replied to Luther in a piece called Hyperaspistes, in the first part of which he answers his arguments, and in the second his personal reflections.\n",
      "In October 1524, Luther threw off the monastic habit, which, though not premeditated or designed, was yet a very proper preparative to a step which he took the year following; we mean his marriage with Catharine de Bore. Catharine de Bore was a gentleman’s daughter, who had been a nun, and was taken, as we have observed, out of the nunnery of Nimptschen, in the year 1523. Luther had a design, as Melchior Adam relates, to marry her to Glacius, a minister of Ortanιunden; but she did not like Glacius, and so, on the 13th of June 1525, Luther married her himself. This conduct of his was severely blamed, not only by the Catholics, but, as Melancthon says, by those of his own party. He was even for some time ashamed of it himself, and owns that his marriage had made him so despicable, that he hoped his humiliation would rejoice the angels, and vex the devils. Melancthon found him so afflicted with what he had done, that he wrote some letters of consolation to him. It was not so much the marriage, as the circumstances of the time, and the precipitation with which it was constituted, that occasioned the censures which were passed upon Luther. He married all of a sudden, and at a time when Germany was groaning u\n",

      "amongst the Romans, prevailed to such a degree that several laws were made to suppress, or at least restrict it. The extravagance of the table commenced about the time of the battle of Actium, and continued in great excess until the reign of Galba. Peacocks, cranes of Malta, nightingales, venison, wild and tame fowl, were considered as delicacies. A profusion of provisions was the reigning taste. Whole wild boars were often served up, and sometimes they were filled with various small animals, and birds of different kinds; a dish which they called the Trojan fun∙se, in allusion to the wooden horse filled with soldiers. Fowls and game of all sorts were served up in pyramids, piled up in dishes as broad as moderate tables. Lucullus had a particular name for each apartment; and in whatever room he ordered his servants to prepare the entertainment, they knew by the direction the expense to which they were to go. When he supped in the Apollo, the expense was fixed at 50,000 drachmae, that is L.1250. Marc Antony provided eight boars for twelve guests. Vitellius had a large silver platter, called Minervas Buckler, which is said to have cost a million of sesterces. In this he blended together the livers of gilt-heads, the brains of pheasants and peacocks, the tongues of phenicopters, and the milts of lampreys. Caligula served up to his guests I pearls of great value dissolved in vinegar; and the same was also done by Clodius the son of AEsop the tragedian. Apicius laid aside ninety millions of sesterces, besides a mighty revenue, for no other purpose but to be sacrificed to luxury; but finding himself involved in debt, he looked over his accounts, and though he had the sum of ten millions of sesterces still left, he poisoned himself from fear of being starved to death.\n",
      "The Roman laws to restrain luxury were the Leges Orchia, Fannia, Didia, Licinia, Cornelia, and many others. But all these were unavailing; for as riches increased I amongst them, so did sensuality.\n",
      "What were the ideas of luxury entertained in England about two centuries ago, may be gathered from the following passage, contained in a discourse prefixed to Holinshed’s Chronicles. “Neither do I,” says the writer of this discourse, “speak this in reproach of any man, God is my judge; but to show, that I do rejoice, rather to see how God has blessed us with his good gifts, and to behold how that in a time wherein all things are grown to the most excessive prices, we yet do find means to obtain and atchieve such furniture as heretofore was impossible. There are old men yet dwelling in the village where I remain, which have noted three things to be marvellously altered in England within their sound remembrance. One is the multitude of chimneys lately erected; whereas in their young days there were not above two or three, if so many, in most uplandish towns of the realm (the religious houses, and manor places of their lords, always excepted, and peradventure some great personages), but each made his fire against a reredoss [screen] in the hall, where he dressed lιis meat and dined. The second is the great amendment of lodging; for, said they, our fathers and we ourselves have lain full oft upon straw pallets covered only with a sheet, under coverlits made of a dogswaine or horharriots (to use their own terms), and a good log under their head instead of a bolster. If it were so that the father or good- i man of the house had a mattrass, or flock bed and sheets, with a sack of chaff to rest his head upon, he thought himself to be as well lodged as the lord of the town. So well were they contented, that pillows (said they) were thought meet only for women in childbed; as for servants, if they had\n",
      "I any sheet above them, it was well; for seldom had they any under their bodies to keep them from pricking straws, that ran oft through the canvas and their hardened hides. The third thing they tell of, is the exchange of treene [wooden] platters into pewter, and wooden spoons into silver or tin; for so common were all sorts of treene vessels in old times, that a man should hardly find four pieces pewter (of which one was peradventure a salt) in a good farmer’s house. Again, in times past, men were contented to dwell in houses builded of sallow, willow, &c. so that the use of oak was in a manner dedicated wholly unto churches, religious houses, princes palaces, navigation, &c. But now willow, &care rejected, and nothing but oak anywhere regarded; and yet see the change, for when our houses were builded of willow, then had we oaken men; but now that our houses are come to be made of oak, our men are not only become willow, but a great many altogether of straw, which is a sore alteration. In these the courage of the owner was a sufficient defence to keep the house in safety; but now the assurance of the timber must defend the men from robbing. Now have we many chimneys, and yet our tenderlins complain of rheums, catarrhs, and poses; then had we none but reredoses, and our heads did never ache. For as the smoke in those days were supposed to be sufficient hardening for the timber of the house; so it was reputed a far better medicine to keep the goodman and his family from the quacks or pose; wherewith, as then, very few were acquainted. Again, our pewterers in time past employed the use of pewter only upon dishes and pots, and a few other trifles for service; whereas now they are grown into such exquisite cunning, that they can in a manner imitate by infusion any form or fashion of cup, dish, salt, bowl, or goblet, which is made by the goldsmith’s craft, though they be ever so curious and very artificially forged. In some places beyond the sea, a garnish of good flat English pewter (I say flat, because dishes and platters in my time began to be made deep, and like basons, and are indeed more convenient both for sauce and keeping the meat warm) is esteemed so precious as the like number of vessels that are made of fine silver.”\n",
      "Particular instances of luxury, in eating, however, might be produced from an earlier period, and would be found to surpass even the extravagance of the Romans. Thus, in the tenth year of the reign of Edward IV., 1470, George Nevill, brother to the Earl of Warwick, at his instalment into the archiépiscopal see of York, entertained most of the nobility and principal clergy, when his bill of fare was 300 quarters of wheat, 350 tuns of ale, 104 tuns of wine, a pipe of spiced wine, eighty fat oxen, six wild bulls, 1004 weathers, 300 hogs, 300 calves, 3000 geese, 3000 capons, 300 pigs, 100 peacocks, 200 cranes, 200 kids, 2000 chickens, 4000 pigeons, 4000 rabbits, 204 bitterns, 4000 ducks, 200 pheasants, 500 partridges, 200 woodcocks, 400 plovers, 100 curlews, 100 quails, 1000 egrets, 200 rees, 400 bucks, does, and roebucks, 1506 hot venison pasties, 4000 cold ditto, 1000 dishes of jelly parted, 4000 dishes of jelly plain, 4000 cold custards, 2000 hot custards, 300 pikes, 300 breams, eight seals, four porpuses, 400 tarts. At this feast the Earl of W τ arwick was steward, the Earl of Bedford treasurer, and Lord Hastings comptroller, with many more noble officers; and there were 1000 servitors, 62 cooks, 515 menial apparitors in the kitchen. But such was the fortune of the man, that after his extreme prodigality, he died in the most abject but unpitied poverty, vinctus jacuit in summa inopia.\n",
      "And as to dress, luxury in that article seems to have attained a great height long before Holinshed’s time. For in the reign of Edward III. we find no fewer than seven sumptuary laws passed in one session of parliament to restrain it. It was enacted, that men-servants of lords, as also of tradesmen and artisans, shall be content with one meal of fish or flesh every day; and the other meals, daily, shall be of milk, cheese, butter, and the like. Neither shall they use any ornaments of gold, silk, or embroidery; nor their wives and daughters any veils above the price of twelvepence. Artisans and yeomenj shall not wear cloth above 40s. the whole piece (the finest then being about L.6 per piece), nor the ornaments before named; nor the women any veils of silk, but only those of thread made in England. Gentlemen under the degree of knights, not having L.100 yearly in land, shall not wear any cloth above 4½ marks the whole piece. Neither shall they or their females use cloth of gold, silver, or embroidery. But esquires having L.200 per annum or upwards of rent may wear cloths of five marks the whole piece of cloth; and they and their females may also wear stuff of silk, silver, ribbons, girdles, or furs. Merchants, citizens, burghers, and artificers or tradesmen, as well of London as elsewhere, who have goods and chattels of the clear value of L,500, and their females, may wear as is allowed to gentlemen and esquires of L.100 per annum. And merchants, citizens, and burgesses, worth above L.1000 in goods and chattels, and their females, may wear the same as gentlemen of L.200 per annum. Knights of 200 marks yearly may wear cloth of six marks the cloth, but no higher; but no cloth of gold, nor furred with ermine: but all knights and ladies having above 400 marks yearly, up to L.1000 per annum, may wear as they please,ermine excepted; and they may wear ornaments of pearl and precious stones for their heads only. Clerks having degrees in cathedrals, colleges, may wear as knights and esquires of the same income. Ploughmen, carters, shepherds, and such like, not having 40s. value in goods or chattels, shall wear no sort of cloth but blanket and russet lawn at 12d. and shall wear girdles and belts; and they shall only eat and drink suitable to their stations. And whosoever uses other apparel than is prescribed by the above laws shall forfeit the same.\n",

      "a very eminent mathematician and philosopher, was the son of a clergyman, and born at Kilmoddan, Scotland, in 1698. In the year 1709 he was sent to the university of Glasgow, where he continued five years, and applied himself intensely to study. His great genius for mathematical learning discovered itself as early as the age of twelve, when, having accidentally met with an Euclid in a friend’s chamber, he became in a few days master of the first six books without any assistance; and it is certain, that in his sixteenth year he had invented many of the propositions which were afterwards published under the title of Geometria Organica. In his fifteenth year he took the degree of master of arts, and on that occasion composed and publicly defended, with great applause, a thesis on the power of gravity. After this he quitted the university, and retired to a country-seat of his uncle, who had the care of his education; for his parents had been some time dead. Here he spent two or three years in pursuing his favourite studies; but, in 1717, he offered himself as a candidate for the professorship of mathematics in the Marischal College of Aberdeen, and obtained it after a ten days’ trial with a very able competitor. In 1719 he went to London, where he became acquainted with Dr Hoadly, then bishop of Bangor, Dr Clarke, Sir Isaac Newton, and other eminent men, at which time also he was admitted a member of the Royal Society; and in another journey in 1721, he contracted an intimacy with Martin Folkes, the president of the society, which continued until his death.\n",

After a short stay at Paris, and visiting other towns in France, they fixed in Lorraine, where Maclaurin wrote his tract on the percussion of bodies, which gained the prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences for the year 1724. But his pupil dying soon afterwards, at Montpellier, he returned immediately to his profession at Aberdeen. He was hardly settled there, however, when he received an invitation to Edinburgh; the curators of that university being desirous that he should supply the place of Mr James Gregory, whose great age and infirmities had rendered him incapable of teaching. He had some difficulties to encounter, arising from competitors, who had good interest with the patrons of the university, and also from the want of an additional fund for the new professor; but at length these were all surmounted, principally by the means of Sir Isaac Newton. In November 1725 he was introduced into the university. After this, the mathematical classes soon became very numerous, there being generally upwards of a hundred young gentlemen attending his lectures every year, who being of different standing and proficiency, he was obliged to divide them into four or five classes, in each of which he employed a full hour every day, from the first of November till the first of June.\n",
      "He lived a bachelor till the year 1733; but being not less formed for society than for contemplation, he then married Anne, the daughter of Mr Walter Stewart, solicitor-general for Scotland. By this lady he had seven children, of whom two sons and three daughters, together with his wife, survived him. In 1734, Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, published a piece called The Analyst, in which he took occasion, from some disputes which had arisen concerning the grounds of the method of fluxions, to attack the method itself, and also to charge mathematicians in general with infidelity in religion. Maclaurin thinking himself included in this charge, began an answer to Berkeley’s book; but, as he proceeded, so many new theories and problems occurred to him, that instead of a vindicatory pamphlet, his work came out a complete system of Fluxions, with their application to the most considerable problems in geometry and natural philosophy. This work was published at Edinburgh in 1742, in two vols, quarto; and as it cost him infinite pains, so it is the most considerable of all his works. In the mean time, he was continually obliging the public with some performance or observation of his own, many of which were published in the fifth and sixth volumes of the Medical Essays at Edinburgh. Some of them were likewise published in the Philosophical Transactions, particularly, 1. Of the Construction and Measure of Curves; 2. A new Method of describing all kinds of Curves; 3. A Letter to Martin Folkes, Esq. on Equations with impossible Roots, May 1726; 4. Continuation of the same, March 1729; 5. On the Description of Curves, with an account of farther improvements, and a paper dated at Nancy, November 27, 1722; 6. An account of the Treatise of Fluxions, January 27, 1742; 7. The same continued, 10th March 1742; 8. A Rule for finding the meridional parts of a Spheroid with the same exactness as of a Sphere, August 1741; 9. Of the basis of the cells wherein the Bees deposit their Honey, 3d November 1734.\n",
      "In the midst of these studies, he was always ready to lend his assistance in contriving and promoting any scheme that might contribute to the service of his country. When the Earl of Morton set out in 1739 for Orkney and Zetland, to visit his estates there, he desired Mr Maclaurin to assist him in settling the geography of those countries, which is very erroneous in all our maps; to examine their natural history, survey the coasts, and measure a degree of the meridian. Maclaurin’s family affairs, and other connections, would not permit him to do this; he, however, drew up a memorial of what he thought necessary to be observed, furnished the proper instruments, and recommended Mr Short the optician as a fit person for the management of them. He had still another scheme for the improvement of geography and navigation, of a more extensive nature; which was the opening of a passage from Greenland to the South Sea by the north pole. That such a passage might be found, he was so fully persuaded, that he has been heard to say, that if his situation admitted of such adventures, he would undertake the voyage, even at his own charge. But when schemes for discovering it were laid before the parliament in 1744, and he was himself consulted by several persons of high rank concerning them, before be could finish the memorials which he proposed to send, the premium was limited to the discovery of a north-west passage; and he used to regret that the word west was inserted, because he conceived that the passage, if it existed at all, would be found not far from the pole.\n",
      "In 1745, having been very active in fortifying the city of Edinburgh against the Highland army, he was obliged to fly from thence to the north of England, where he was invited by Herring, then archbishop of York, to reside with him during his stay in this country. In this expedition, however, being exposed to cold and hardships, and naturally of a weak and delicate constitution, he laid the foundation of an illness which put an end to his life, in June 1746, at the age of forty-eight.\n",
      "Mr Maclaurin was a good as well as a great man, and worthy of esteem as well as admiration. His peculiar merit as a philosopher consisted in this, that all his studies were accommodated to general utility; and we find, in many places of his works, an application even of the most abstruse theories, to the perfecting of the mechanical arts. For this purpose, he had resolved to compose a course of practical mathematics, and to rescue several useful branches of the science from the bad treatment which they had often met with in less skilful hands. But all this was prevented by his death; unless we should reckon, as part of bis intended work, the translation of Dr David Gregory s Practical ' Geometry, which he revised, and published with additions in 1745. In his lifetime, however, he had frequent opportunities of serving his friends and his country by his great skill. Whatever difficulty occurred concerning the constructing or perfecting of machines, the working of mines, the improving of manufactures, the conveying of water, or the execution of any other public work, he was at hand to resolve it. He was likewise employed to terminate some disputes of consequence which had arisen at Glasgow concerning the gauging of vessels; and for that purpose presented to the Commissioners of Excise two elaborate memorials, with demonstrations, containing rules by which the officers now act. He also made calculations relating to the provision, now established by law, for the widows and children of the Scotch clergy, and of the professors in the universities, entitling them to certain annuities and sums, upon the voluntary annual payment of a certain sum by the incumbents. In contriving and adjusting this wise and useful scheme he bestowed a great deal of labour, and contributed not a little towards bringing it to perfection. Of such a man, it may be said that he lived to some purpose; which can hardly be predicated of those, how uncommon soever their abilities and attainments, who spend their whole time in abstract speculations, and produce nothing really useful or serviceable to their fellow-creatures.\n",
      "Of his works, we have mentioned his Geometria Organica, in which he treats of the description of curve lines by continued motion. We need not repeat what has been said concerning the paper which gained the prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1724. In 1740 the academy adjudged him a prize, which did him still more honour, for solving the motion of the tides from the theory of gravity; a question which had been given out the previous year, but without receiving any solution. He had only ten days to draw up this paper, and could not find leisure to transcribe a fair copy; so that the Paris edition of it is incorrect. He afterwards revised the whole, and inserted it in his Treatise of Fluxions; as he did also \n",

      "----\n",
      "an island situated off the western coast of Africa, about fifty-four miles in length by twenty-one in breadth. It is a country of rocks, consisting of a number of lofty mountains, on the declivities of which all the productions of the island are raised. The best account of the island is that by the late Mr Edward Bowdich, whose journey over the island we shall follow. The country at the back and sides of Funchal, the capital, presents the broken outline of a segment of a vast natural amphitheatre of basaltic peaks and mountains, rising to 3800 feet behind the Mount Church, which is the most striking edifice in this beautiful landscape, and is elevated 1900 feet above the sea, presenting the most picturesque breaks and vistas, intersected by ravines and torrents, and covered with undulating and rugged ridges and sheets of basalt, diverging from the more central heights, and descending boldly to the sea. The basalt is both columnar and granular; the former is, generally speaking, compact, of a broad conchoidal fracture, splitting in horizontal laminae, or at right angles to the prism, dark gray within or on the surface of a fresh fracture, which becomes covered with a superficial decomposing coat of brownish red, with age-inducing brittleness, and passing ultimately into yellowish white and dull brown; a moderately thin plate of the columnar basalt, when covered exteriorly with red powder, will snap between the fingers. The next place of importance is the Peak of Ariero, about three hours’ ride from Funchal. The latter part of the ascent is along the barren rocks of basalt and red tuffa, which form the highest outline of the view behind from Funchal, and are 3700 feet above the sea. The peak is 5446 feet above the level of the sea, and is covered with vegetation to the top. The Coural, or sheepfold, is an immense valley near the village of Comera de Lobos, completely surrounded with almost perpendicular hills, and in no part less than 1000 feet in height. Round a part of three cliffs is a narrow road, winding along the brink of the precipices, often cut out of the solid rock, across peaks and gaps which were formerly impassable. This road has been of great importance in connecting the interior of the island with the sea coast, and useful for transporting the productions of the country to the capital.\n",
      "The soil in every part is extremely fertile; the hills are covered with a luxuriant vegetation; and the finest flowers, sometimes of aquatic species, are found growing on the summits, being supplied with a moisture from the constant vicinity of the clouds. Trees and shrubs of the finest kinds are everywhere found in great abundance; and tropical plants which have strayed from the gardens soon become perfectly naturalized to the soil. The Portuguese formerly procured their principal supplies of sugar from this place; but not being able to compete with the West Indian planters, the inhabitants betook themselves to the culture of the vine, which has since become the chief product of the island. It is said that plants of the vine were conveyed from Crete to Madeira in 1421, and have since succeeded extremely well. There is considerable difference in the flavour and other qualities of the wines of Madeira; the best are produced on the south side of the island. The method of cultivation most generally followed is to trench the ground from three to seven and even nine feet deep, according to the nature of the soil, and lay a quantity of loose or stony earth at the bottom, to prevent the roots from reaching the clayey soil beneath, which would otherwise oppose their growth. The ground is watered three times if the summer has been very dry, the sluices being left open until the ground is pretty well saturated; the less the ground is watered the stronger the wine, but the quantity is diminished in proportion. The vines are found to bear fruit as high as 2700 feet, but no wine can be made from it. Wheat, barley, and rye are produced, but scarcely amount to one fifth of the quantity annually consumed. Wheat is sown in October and reaped in June; and the crop is followed by beans or sweet potatoes. The chestnut-tree has been introduced, and forms the principal timber of the island, and affords the chief food of the peasantry. Rice is cultivated, but more as ornamental grass than for any useful purpose. Pine and custard apples, and various other fruits, are grown in the open air in considerable quantities. In consequence of the land rising to a great elevation, this island presents great diversity of climate, though, upon the whole, it is mild and healthy. The rainy season comprehends the months of October, November, December, and January, although the dry weather during the first two months generally exceeds the rainy. The prevailing winds during this season are from the west and the south-west. In the dry season the prevailing winds are from the north-east, and they are not saturated with humidity like those which blow over the equinoctial seas. Although vegetation is so great, the pasture is scanty, and only capable of maintaining a small number of cows, which renders the productions of the dairy objects of luxury. A few oxen are used in the towns; but the mule is the most common beast of burden, and is best adapted for carrying goods along the narrow paths of the mountains. There are abundance of goats and hogs, which being allowed to run wild, acquire a resemblance to venison in taste; rabbits are very common in mountainous districts. Myriads of lizards inhabit the gardens and vineyards, and do considerable damage amongst the refined grapes. Bees abound in hills and valleys, and produce a honey of peculiar delicacy, from the numerous aromatic herbs on which they feed. The population is thought to be at present (1816) about 100,000, though some accounts represent it as much greater. From the extent of the island, and the rocky nature of the land, this census is very great. The inhabitants have evidently sprung from various sources. Amongst the richer inhabitants and merchants are found natives of almost every commercial country, but the greatest number are British. These hold little intercourse with the other inhabitants, but live in a state of luxury among themselves, and show great hospitality to strangers visiting the island. The peasants are generally of Portuguese descent, who, amidst the plenty which surrounds them, live in a state of great poverty. In appearance they are tall, well made, but meagre, with gloomy looks and long black hair; and they are very polite. Their dress consists of white linen trousers, made very wide, over which are drawn boots of buff leather; a coarse white shirt open at the neck, displaying their sun-burnt breasts; a blue cap and jacket, ornamented with silver buttons; and in winter they wear long cloaks. The females are condemned to severe labour: whilst the males are engaged in the vineyards, it is their duty to procure fuel, and often to carry loads of it to the city to dispose of for their subsistence, besides other households toils. They are generally of hard, yet not disagreeable features, with high cheek-bones, dark complexions, and rather large feet; their bodies, however, are well proportioned, and their eyes are lively, large, and black. The want of animal food is severely felt by the peasantry, the most hard-working labourer being constrained to live almost entirely upon bread, roots, and fruits. They extract from the husks and stalks of the grape, after they have passed through the wine-press, a kind of small beer called aqua pe i which, when fermented, acquires some degree of tartness, but will not keep.\n",
      "The capital, Funchal, is a considerable town, situated in the centre of a large bay. It is built on the declivity of a hill, and the streets are kept clean, being watered by streams from the mountains. The bay is not very secure for anchorage, and is even dangerous during south winds. The landing is difficult, owing to the great surf which breaks upon the shore. It is strongly fortified towards the sea; but the defences on the land side have been greatly neglected. The wealthier inhabitants are generally British merchants, engaged in the wine trade. It is situated in long. 17. 6. W. and lat. 32. 37. N.\n",
      "Adjacent to Madeira is the island of Porto Santo, about six miles long and two and a half broad. It is high and rocky, composed principally of sandstone, and a calcareous tuffa of a greenish-gray colour. The vine is cultivated in considerable quantities, and the soil yields good crops of wheat, Indian corn, barley, and beans. The population is estimated at 1400, and there are 300 militia. It possesses a good roadstead, but the landing place is bad. The Desertas are small uninhabited islands, which, with Madeira and Porto Santo, form the group called the Madeiras.\n",
      "These islands were first settled by the Portuguese; but a tradition exists of their having been visited by an English gentleman, and lady to whom he was attached, who were left behind by accident, and both died there soon afterwards. It has belonged to the Portuguese ever since, and was considered as of such importance to the commerce of this country, that, during the late war, it was held in trust by Great Britain for her ally.\n",
      "Its commerce consists almost entirely in the export of its wine. The principal quantity is sent to Great Britain, the East and West Indies, and America; but from frequent adulteration, and the preference of French wines, the trade is not now so great as it formerly was, the growth of the island not exceeding 20,000 pipes. The best is that known by the name of London particular, the second London market; and there is also a very rich sweet wine called Malmsey. The quantity of Madeira wines imported into Great Britain in 1833 was 301,057 gallons; of this, 161,042 gallons were retained for home consumption, and 209,194 exported. The price of these wines in London varies from L.18 to L.80 per pipe, acc\n",

      "when seen from the sea, presents a striking appearance, the fortifications of Fort St George being within a few yards of the shore; and, at a distance, minarets and pagodas are seen mixed with trees and gardens. The public offices and storehouses are fine buildings, with colonnades to the upper stories, supported on arched bases, covered with beautiful shell-mortar from Madras, which is hard, smooth, and polished. These being near the beach, which is always crowded, form interesting objects. At a distance, the low, flat, sandy shores extending to the north and south, and the small hills that are seen inland, give an appearance of barrenness, which, however, improves on a closer inspection. Madras is surrounded by a level country, which in general exhibits a naked, brown, dusty plain, with few villages to enliven the scene, or any other objects to relieve the eye, except a range of abrupt detached hills to the south. The huts of the natives are covered with tiles, and are fully superior in their appearance to those in Bengal; and in the inns and chaultries, also, which are common on the roads, travellers experience greater attention. The soil in the vicinity of Madras is very poor, and formerly provisions were scarce and dear; but since the great accession of territory that has accrued to the Madras presidency, they are brought from the Barramahal and other parts of the country in great abundance. The soil, however, when it is cultivated, and where there is abundance of water, produces a good crop of rice; and artificial irrigation often makes up for natural disadvantages. The cattle that are found in the neighbourhood of Madras are a small breed, such as are commonly seen in the Deccan; but they are larger than those in the southern parts of Bengal. Buffaloes of a small size arc generally used in carts.\n",
      "The manners of the Europeans at Madras, the state of society, and style of living, are nearly the same as in other parts of India, except that provisions are more expensive. Within doors, dinner parties, and, during the cold season, monthly assemblies and balls, constitute the routine of amusements. Amongst the public places of resort is the Mount Road, leading from the fort to St Thomas’s Mount, which is quite smooth, and embellished on each side with banyan and yellow tulip trees. Here it is customary for the fashionable parties in Madras to repair, in their gayest equipages, during the cool of the evening, where they drive slowly about the cenotaph which is here erected to the memory of Marquis Cornwallis, and converse together. During the hottest part of the day, namely, after two o’clock, which is the time when tiffin or the real dinner is eaten, many retire to rest until five o’clock, when the master of the family returns from the fort, and an excursion to the Mount Road, and dinner, then occupies the remainder of the day, unless it be prolonged by a ball and supper in the evening. The morning, from nine to eleven, is the time for visiting, when the European residents call on each other, retail the news, and offer their services to their friends in the city, to which they must repair for purposes of business. Another tribe of visitors succeeds, and thus the forenoon passes away.\n",
      "European passengers, when they land at Madras, being ignorant of the language, manners, and customs of the country, necessarily rely on the natives for help; and, accordingly, passengers landing at Madras are immediately surrounded by numerous servants of all kinds, called dobashies, eager for employment They undertake to transact for the Europeans all their necessary business, I to buy all that is wanted, and to procure servants, tradesmen, palanquins, and the like. They are of different castes, according to the nature of the duties which they undertake to perform.\n",
      "Madras carries on a very considerable trade, not only with Europe, but with China, Ceylon, Pegu, the Isle of France, New Holland, and different parts of India. But, owing to the want of a navigable river, and the difficulty of landing goods, it labours under great disadvantages, and its commerce is inferior to that of the other two presidencies. From America the imports are some inferior sorts of wines, spirits, and provisions. Rice is imported from Bengal, also raw silk, canvass, piece goods, muslins, and shawls of a coarse description, silk piece goods of an inferior kind, long pepper, sugar, borax, saltpetre, precious stones, &c. From Bombay are imported, through the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, dried fruit or drugs, cotton and other goods; from Ceylon, biche de mer, shark fins, ebony, &c. also pearls; from China, tea, sugar, nankeen, China ware, with alum, camphor, drugs, piece goods, stationery, &c.; from Manilla, indigo; from the Isle of France, brandy, copper, iron, lead, &c.; from Pegu, the staple article is timber; from the Malabar coast, pepper, timber, coir, cordage, &c.; from London, different articles of European manufacture, in glass, iron, copper, tin, and other manufactures, also supplies of wine and other necessaries; from Madeira, wine. The exports of Madras consist of piece goods to America; to Batavia, piece goods of a coarse coloured sort, handkerchiefs, and a proportion of southern blue cloths; to Bengal, some red wood, coloured piece goods, and salt; to Bombay, chintz and coloured turbans to an inconsiderable amount; to Ceylon, principally European and China articles; to China, principally cotton; to Manilla, piece goods, namely, cambays, handkerchiefs, &c.; to the Isle of France, chiefly long cloths, handkerchiefs, muslins, ginghams, &c.; to Pegu, coarse handkerchiefs, and copper, arrack, brandy, mace, cloves, iron, glass ware, naval stores, &c. which are re-exported. It does not appear that the trade of Madras, which is really the trade of the coast of Coromandel, is increasing. For this several causes are assigned. Amongst these are various oppressive inland taxes, which obstruct the progress of improvement. Owing to the former monopoly of the East India Company, the raw silks and nankeens of China, which could not be exported directly to Europe, were brought to Madras, and thence re-exported. They are now directly exported from Canton, and the trade is consequently lost to Madras. The value of the exports and imports of Madras, in bullion and merchandise, was in 1813-14 L.695,373, and in 1828-29 L.788,959, thus exhibiting during this interval only the trifling increase of L.93,586.\n",
      "Considerable variety of coin circulates in Madras and its vicinity. Of the gold coins, the principal are, star or current pagodas, value 7s. 5∣d. or 8s. The gold rupee, new coinage, is worth L.l. 9s. 2d. The Arcot rupee, and the new silver rupee, are worth Is. 11∣d., and Is. 11⅜d. The accounts are kept in star pagodas, fanams, and cash; eighty cash make one fanam, twelve fanamsone rupee, and forty-two fanaπιs a star pagoda. The natives keep their accounts at twelve fanams sixty cash to a rupee, and forty-four fanams sixty cash to a pagoda. The current coins consist of various sorts of pagodas, Arcot rupees, single and double fanams, and copper coins of twenty, ten, five, and one cash each, called dodees and half dodees.\n",
      "The English possessed no fixed establishment here until A. D. 1639, when they received a grant from the Hindu dynasty of Bijanagur, then reigning at Chandergherry, permitting the erection of a fort. In consequence of this permission, Mr Day proceeded with great alacrity to the construction of a fortress, which in India is soon surrounded by a town; and this town he allowed to retain its Indian appellation, but the fort he named Fort George. The territory granted along with it extended five miles along shore, and one mile inland. For about a century, Madras, with the small portion of territory adjoining, continued to be held by the Europeans, but rather under, or at least with the consent of, the native powers, than as an independent colony. On the 12th of December 1687, the population of the city of Madras, Fort George, and the villages within the Company’s bounds, was estimated to amount to 300,000 persons. In 1744 Madras was besieged by the French from the Mauritius under Μ. de la Bourdonnais, at which period the native inhabitants within the Company’s territory amounted to 250,000. The English in the colony did not exceed 300, and of these 200 only were soldiers of the garrison. The town was taken on the 10th of September, and was ransomed for L.440,000, besides plunder to the amount of L.200,000 more. All the British inhabitants were afterwards compelled to abandon the place. Madras was restored at the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, and evacuated by the French in August 1749, when it was found in a very improved condition, the bastions and batteries having been greatly enlarged and strengthened. The defences of the town were still, however, inferior to those of Fort St David, where the East India Company ordered the presidency to continue. Madras was again besieged in 1758, by the French under Μ. Lally. The siege commenced on the 17th of December 1758, and was prosecuted with vigour till the 17th of February, when the French were obliged precipitately to raise it. This was the last and most memorable siege which Madras ever sustained. The garrison consisted of 1758 European troops, 2200 sepoys, and 150 European inhabitants. The besieging force consisted of 3500 Europeans, 2000 sepoys, and 2000 native and European cavalry. Since this period Madras has never been assailed by an enemy, though nearly approached by Hyder’s cavalry in 1781, when they descended from the mountains to ravage the plains of the Carnatic.

      "in literature and in common life, a conversation between two or more persons, and either written or oral.\n",
      "As the end of speech is conversation, no kind of writing can be more natural than dialogue, which represents this. Accordingly we find it was introduced at a very early period; for there are several instances of it in the Mosaic history. The ancient Greek writers, especially the philosophers, also fell very much into dialogue, as the most convenient and agreeable method of communicating their sentiments and instructions to mankind. And indeed it seems to be attended with very considerable advantages, if well and judiciously managed; for it is capable of rendering the driest subjects entertaining and pleasant, by its variety, and by the different characters of the speakers. Besides, things may be canvassed more minutely, and many lesser matters, which serve to clear up a subject, may be introduced with better grace, by means of questions and answers, objections and replies, than can be con-venientlydone in a continued discourse. There is likewise a further advantage in this way of writing, that the author is at liberty to choose his speakers; and therefore, as Cicero has well observed, that when we imagine that we have persons of an established reputation for wisdom and knowledge talking together, this circumstance necessarily addsaweight and authority to the discourse, and more closely engages the attention. The subject-matter of dialogue is very extensive; for whatever is a proper argument of discourse, public or private, serious or jocose—whatever is fit for wise and ingenious men to talk upon, either for improvement or diversion—is suitable for a dialogue.\n",
      "From this general account of the nature of dialogue, it is easy to perceive what kind of style best suits it. Its affinity with epistles shows there ought to be no great difference between them in this respect. Indeed, some have been of opinion that it ought rather to sink below the style of an epistle, because dialogues should in all respects represent the freedom of conversation, whereas epistles ought sometimes to be composed with care and accuracy, especially when written to superiors. But there seems to be little weight in this argument, since the design of an epistle is to say the same things, and in the same manner, as the writer judges would be most fit and proper for him to speak if present; and in a dialogue the design is similar with respect to the several persons concerned in it. Upon the whole, therefore, a plain, easy, and simple style, suited to the nature of the subject, and the particular characters of the persons concerned, seems to be alike suitable to both.\n",
      "But as greater skill is required in writing dialogues than letters, we shall give a more particular account of the priqcipal things necessary to be regarded in their composition, and illustrate them chiefly from Cicero’s excellent dialogues concerning an orator. A dialogue then consists of two parts; an introduction, and the body of the discourse.\n",
      "The introduction acquaints us with the place, time, persons, and occasion of the conversation. Thus Cicero places the scene of his dialogues at the country seat of Crassus; a very proper retreat, both for such a debate and the parties engaged in it. And as they were persons of the first rank, employed in the greatest affairs of the state, and as the discourse occupied them for two days, he represents it to have happened at the time of a festival, when no business was done at Rome, and an opportunity was thus afforded them of being absent.\n",
      "And because the greatest regard should be had in the choice of the persons, who ought to be such as are well acquainted with the subject upon which they discourse, in these dialogues of Cicero the two principal disputants are Crassus and Antony, the greatest orators of that age, and therefore the most proper persons to dispute respecting the qualifications essential for their art. One would think it scarcely necessary to observe that the corfference should be held by persons who lived at the time, and thus were capable of conversing together. But yet some good writers have run into the impropriety of feigning dialogues between persons who had lived at distant times. Plato adopted this method, in which he has been followed by Macrobius. But others, who have been willing to bring persons to discourse together who lived in different ages, without such inconsistency, have written dialogues of the dead. Lucian has made himself most remarkable in this way. As to the number of persons in a dialogue, they may bc more or fewer; so many as can conveniently carry on a conversation without disorder or confusion, or they may be only two. Some of Cicero’s dialogues have but two, others three or more, and those concerning an orator seven. But it is convenient in some respects that they should all be persons of different characters and abilities; a circumstance which contributes both to the variety and beauty of the discourse, like the different attitudes of figures in a picture. Thus, in Cicero’s dialogues last mentioned, Crassus excelled in art, Antony principally by the force of his genius, Catullus by the purity of his style, Scevola by his skill in the law, Caesar by wit and humour; and Sulpitius and Cotta, though young men, were both excellent orators, yet they differed in their manner. But there should be always one principal person, having the main part of the conversation; like the hero in an epic poem or a tragedy, who excels the rest in action, or the principal figure in a picture, which is always made the most conspicuous. In Plato’s dialogues this is Socrates, and Crassus in those of Cicero above mentioned.\n",
      "It is usual likewise, in the introductions, to acquaint us with the occasion of the discourse. Indeed this is not always mentioned; as in Cicero’s dialogue concerning the parts of oratory, where the son begins immediately with desiring his father to instruct him in the art. But it is generally taken notice of, and most commonly represented as accidental; the reason of which may be, that such discourses appear most natural, and may likewise afford some kind of apology for the writer in managing his different characters, since the greatest men may be supposed not always to speak with the utmost exactness in an accidental conversation. Thus Cicero, in his dialogues concerning an orator, makes Crassus occasionally fall upon the subject of oratory, in order to divert the company from the melancholy thoughts of what they had been discoursing of before, with relation to the public disorders, and the dangers which threatened their common country. But the introduction ought not to be too long and tedious. Mr Addison complains of this fault in some authors who employ dialogue. “For though,” as he says, “some of the finest treatises of the most polite Latin and Greek writers are in dialogue, as many very valuable pieces of French, Italian, and English, appear in the same dress; yet in some of them there is so much time taken up in ceremony, that, before they enter on their subject, the dialogue is half over.”\n",
      "We come now to the body of the discourse, in which some things relating to the persons, and others to the subject, are proper to be remarked.\n",
      "And as to the persons, the principal thing tobe attended to is to keep up a justness and consistency of character throughout the whole. And the distinct characters ought to be so perfectly observed, that even from the very words it may be always known who is the speaker. This renders dialogue more difficult than single description, by reason of the number and variety of characters which are to be drawn at the same time, and each of them managed with the greatest propriety. The principal speaker should appear to be a person of great sense and wisdom, and best acquainted with the subject. No question ought to be asked him, nor objection started, but what he should fairly answer; and all that is said by the rest should principally tend to promote his discourse, and carry it through in the most artful and agreeable mannër. When the argument is attended with difficulties, one other person or more, of equal reputation, or nearly so, but of different sentiments, should be introduced to oppose him, and maintain the contrary side of the question. This affords an opportunity for a thorough examination of the point on both sides, and for answering all objections. But if the combatants are not pretty equally matched, and masters of the subject, they will treat it but superficially. Through the whole debate, however, there ought not to be the least wrangling, peevishness, or obstinacy; nothing indeed but the appearance of good humour and good breeding, together with a readiness to submit to conviction and the force of truth, according as the evidence shall appear to be on one side or the other. In Cicero, these two characters are Crassus and Antony; and from them Mr Addison seemă to have taken his Philander and Cynthio in his Dialogues upon the Usefulness of Ancient Medals, which are formed pretty much upon Cicero’s plan. When younger persons are introduced, or such as are not equally acquainted with the subject, they should rather be inquisitive than disputative; and the questions they ask should bc neither too long nor too frequent, in order that they may not too much interrupt the debate, nor appear over talkative before wiser and more experienced persons. Sulpitius and Cotta sustain this character in Cicero, and Eugenius in Mr Addison. It is very convenient, however, that there should be one person of a witty and jocose humour, to enliven the discourse at proper seasons, and render it the more entertaining, especially when the dialogue is drawn out to any considerable length. Caesar performs this part in Cicero; and in Mr Addison, Cynthio, a person of a similar turn, opposes Philander in a humorous way. Mr Addison’s subject admitted of this; but the seriousness and gravity of\n",

      "the science of diplomas, or of ancient literary monuments, public documents, and the like. It does not, however, nor can it, absolutely extend its researches to antiquity, but is chiefly confined to the middle age and the first centuries of modern times. For although the ancients were accustomed to reduce their contracts and treaties into writing, yet they engraved them on tablets of brass, copper, stone, or wood; and all that in the first ages were not traced on brass or marble has perished by the length of time and the number of destructive events.\n",
      "1. The word diploma signifies properly a letter or epistle which is folded in the middle, and which consequently is not open. But in more modern times the title has been given to all ancient epistles, letters, literary monuments, and public documents, and to all those pieces of writing which the ancients called Syngrapha, Chirographa, Codicilli, and the like. In the middle ages, and in the diplomas themselves, these writings are called Litterae, Proe-cepta, Placita, Chartae indiculoe, Sigilla, and Bullae ; as also Panchartae, Pantochartae, Tractorioe, Descriptiones, and so forth. The originals of these pieces are named Examplaria or Autographa, Chartae autlienticae, Originalia, &c. and the copies, Apographa, Copioe, Particulae, and so on. The collections which have been made of them are called Chartaria and Chartulia. The place where these papers and documents were kept the ancients named Scrinia, Tabularium, or AErarium, words which were derived from the tablets of brass, and, according to the Greek idiom, Archeium or Archivum.\n",
      "2. In order to understand the nature of these ancient papers, diplomas, and manuscripts, and to distinguish the authentic from the counterfeit, it is necessary to know that the paper of the ancients came from Egypt, and was formed of thin leaves or membranes taken from the branches of a tree named Papyrus Biblum, or AEgyptiacum, and which were pasted one over the other with the slime of the Nile, and pressed and polished with a pumice stone. This paper was very scarce, and it was of various qualities, forms, and prices, which they distinguished by the name of charta hieratica, luria, augusta, amphithcatrica, saitica, taìiirica, emporetica. They cut this paper into square leaves, which they pasted one to the other in order to make rolls of them, whence an entire book was called volumen, from volνere, to roll, and the leaves of which it consisted paginae. Sometimes, also, they pasted ţhe leaves all together by one of their extremities, as is now practised in binding; by this method they formed the back of a book, and these the learned called codices. They rolled the volume round a stick, which they named umbilicus, and the two ends which protruded beyond the paper were called cornua. The title, written on parchment in purple characters, was joined to the last sheet, and served it as a cover. They made use of all sorts of strings or ribands, and even sometimes of locks, to close the book; and sometimes also it was put into a case. But there is not now to be found, in any library or cabinet whatsoever, any one of these volumes. We have been assured, however, by a traveller, that he had seen several of them in the ruins of Herculaneum, but so damaged, and the paper so stiff and brittle, by length of time, that it was impossib⅛Γ to unrol them, and, consequently, to make use of any of them; for on the first touch they fell into tatters.\n",
      "3. We are ignorant of the precise time when our modern paper was invented, and when people began to make use of pens in writing instead of the stalks of reeds. The ink which the ancients used was not made of vitriol and galls, like the modern, but of soot. Sometimes also they wrote with red ink made of vermilion, or in letters of gold on purple or violet parchment. It is not difficult for those who apply themselves to this study, to distinguish the parchment of the ancients from that of the moderns, as well as the ink; but that which best distinguishes the original from the counterfeit is the writing or character itself, which is so different in different centuries, that we may tell with certainty, within about forty or fifty years, when any diploma was written. There are two works which furnish the clearest lights on this matter, and which may serve as sure guides in the judgments we may have occasion to form as to what are called ancient diplomas. The one is the celebrated treatise on Diplomatics, by Mabillon, and the other the first volume of the Chronicon Got-vicense. We there find specimens of all the characters, the flourishes, and different methods of writing, of every age. For these matters, therefore, we must refer our readers to the works just mentioned.\n",
      "4. All the diplomas are written in Latin, and consequently the letters and characters have a resemblance to each other; but there are certain strokes of the pen which distinguish not only the ages, but also the different nations, as the writings of the Lombards, French, Saxons, and so on. The letters in the diplomas also are usually longer and less decided than those of manuscripts. There has also been introduced a kind of court hand, of a very disproportionate length, and the letters of which are called exiles litterae crispae, ac protractiorcs. The first line of the diploma, the signature of the sovereign, that of the chancellor, notary, &c. are usually written in this character.\n",
      "5. The signature of a diploma consists either of the sign of the cross, or of a monogram or cipher, composed of the letters of the names of those who subscribed it. The initial letters of the name, and sometimes also the titles, were placed about this cross. By degrees the custom changed, and they invented other marks, as, for example, the sign of Charlemagne, which was thus written:\n",
      "R\n",
      "K_A_S\n",
      "L\n",
      "They sometimes also added the dates and epoch of the signature, the feasts of the church, the days of the calendar, and other like matters. The successive corruption of the Latin language; the style and orthography of each age, as węll as their different titles and forms; the abbreviations, accentuation, and punctuation, and the various methods of writing the diphthongs; all these matters united form so many characters and marks by which the authenticity of a diploma may be known.\n",
      "6. The seal annexed to a diploma was anciently of white wax, and was artfully imprinted on the parchment itself. It was afterwards pendant from the paper, and inclosed in a box or case, which was called bulla. There are also some which have been stamped on metal, and even on pure gold. When a diploma bears all the characters which are requisite to the time and place where it is supposed to be written, its authenticity is not to be doubted; but at the same time we cannot examine these too scrupulously, seeing that the monks and priests of former ages were very adroit in making counterfeits, the more so as they enjoyed the confidence of princes and statesmen, and were even sometimes in possession of their rings or seals.\n",
      "7. With regard to manuscripts which were written before the invention of printing, it is necessary to know their nature, their essential qualities, and matter; to be able to read them freely, and without error; to judge of their antiquity by those characters which we have just mentioned with reference to the diplomas; and to render them of use in the sciences. As there are scarcely any of the ancient codes now remaining written on the Egyptian paper, or on wood, ivory, &c. we have only to consider those which are written on parchment or vellum (membraneos'), and such as are written on our paper (chartaceos). The former of these are in most esteem. With regard to the character, these codices are written either in square and capital letters, or in half square or round and small letters. Those of the first kind are the most ancient. There are no intervals between the words, no letters different from the others at the beginning of any word, no points, nor any other distinction. The codices which are written in half square letters resemble those we have in Gothic characters, as well for the age as the form of the letters. Such as are written in round letters are not so ancient as the former, and do not go higher than the ninth or tenth century. These have spaces between the words, and some punctuation; but they are not so well written as the preceding, and are frequently disfigured with comments. The codices are divided, according to the country, into Lombard, Italian, Gaelic, Franco-Gaelic, Saxon, Anglo-Saxon, and so forth.\n",
      "8. In the ancient Greek books they frequently terminated the periods of a discourse, instead of all other divisions, by lines, and these divisions were called, in Latin, versus, a vertendo; for which reason these lines arc still more properly named versus than lineoe. At the end of a work the number of verses of which it consisted was put down, in order that the copies might be more easily collated; and it is in this sense that wc are to understand Tribonius, when he says that the Pandects contain 150,000 poene versuum. These codices were likewise vel probae vel deterioris notae, more or less perfect, not only with regard to the calligraphy or beauty of the character, but also with reference to the correctness of the text.\n",
      "9. It is likewise necessary to observe, in ancient codices, the abbreviations as they have been used in different centuries. Thus, for example, A. C. D. signifies Aulus Caius Decimus; Ap. Cn. Appius Cneius; Aug. Imp. Augustus Imperator. The characters which are called notae are such as are not to be found in the alphabet; but which, notwithstanding, signify certain words. Lastly, the learned divide all the ancient codices into codives minus raros, rariores, editos, et anecdotos. The critical art is here indispensably necessary; its researches, moreover, have no bounds, and the more as the use of it augments qvery day, by the discoveries which are made in langua\n",

      "Divorce was allowed of in great latitude both amongst the Pagans and Jews. In Rome, barrenness, age, disease, madness, and banishment, were the ordinary causes of divorce. Under the consulship of Μ. Attilius and P. Valerius, Spurius Carvilius was the first who put away his wife because she was barren; though Plutarch, in his Roman Questions, maintains that Domitian was the first who permitted divorce. Justinian afterwards added impotence, a vow of chastity, and the profession of a monastic life, as valid reasons of divorce.\n",
      "The Roman lawyers distinguish between repudium and divortium ; the former being the breaking of a contract or espousal, and the latter separation after matrimony. Romulus enacted a severe law, which forbade a wife to leave hcr husband, but gave the husband the liberty of turning away his wife, either upon her poisoning her children, counterfeiting his private keys, or committing the crime of adultery; if the husband, however, put her away on any other occasion, he ordered one moiety of his estate to be settled on the wife, and the other to be given to the goddess Ceres, besides an atonement to the gods of the earth. In later times, however, the women as well as the men might sue a divorce. The common way of divorcing was by sending a bill to the woman, containing the reasons of separation, and the tender of all her goods which she brought with her, and this was called repudium mittere ; or else it was performed in her presence, and before seven witnesses, accompanied with the formalities of tearing the writings, refunding the dowry, taking away the keys, and turning the woman out of doors.\n",
      "The Grecian laws concerning divorce were different. The Cretans allowed divorce to any man who was afraid of having too many children. The Spartans seldom divorced their wives, and it was extremely scandalous for a woman to depart from her husband. The Athenians allowed divorce on very trivial grounds. It proceeded by a bill, containing the reason of the divorce, and approved, if the party appealed, by the chief magistrate; and women also were allowed to leave their husbands on just occasions. Persons divorcing their wives were obliged to return their portions, otherwise the Athenian laws obliged them to pay nine oboli a month for alimony. The terms expressing the separation of men and women from each other were different; the men were said am , πiμπttv or a t ιrο ∖ υnv, to dismiss their wives; but wives, a<κοKu<jrnv, to leave their husbands. ii The law of Moses,” observes Archdeacon Paley, “for reasons of local expediency, permitted the Jewish husband to put away his wife; but whether for every cause, or for what cause, appears to have been controverted amongst the interpreters of those times. Christ, the precepts of whose religion were calculated for more general use and observation, revokes this permission, as given to the Jews ‘ for their hardness of heart,’ and promulgates a law which was thenceforward to confine divorces to the single cause of adultery in the wůfe: ‘ W τ hosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away, doth commit adultery.’\n",
      "“Inferior causes may justify the separation of husband and wife, although they will not authorize such a dissolution of the marriage contract as w z ould leave either at liberty to marry again; for it is that liberty in which the danger and mischief of divorces generally consist. The law of this country, in conformity to our Saviour’s injunction, confines the dissolution of the marriage contract to the single case of adultcry in the wife; and a divorce even in that case can only be brought about by the operation of an act of parliament, founded upon a previous sentence in the spiritual court, and a verdict against the adulterer at common law; which proceedings taken together compose as complete an investigation of the complaint as a cause can receive. It has lately been proposed to the legislature to annex a clause to these acts, restraining the offending party from marrying with the companion of her crime, who by the course of proceeding is always known and convicted; for there is reason to fear that adulterous connections arc often formed with the prospect of bringing them to this conclusion; at least, when the seducer has once captivated the affection of a married woman, he may avail himself of this tempting argument to subdue her scruples and complete his victory; and the legislature, as the business is managed at present, assists by its interposition the criminal design of the offenders, and confers a privilege where it ought to inflict a punishment. The proposal deserved an experiment; but something more penal, it is apprehended, will be found necessary to check the progress of this alarming depravity. Whether a law might not be framed, directing the fortune of the adultress to descend as in case of lier natural death ; reserving, however, a certain proportion of the produce of it, by way of annuity, for her subsistence (such annuity in no case to exceed a certain sum); and also so far suspending the estate in the hands of the heir as to preserve the inheritance to any children she might bear to a second marriage, in case there was none to succeed in the place of their mother by the first; whether such a law would not render female virtue in higher life less vincible, as well as the seducers of that virtue less urgent in their suit, I would recommend to the deliberation of those who are willing to attempt the reformation of this important but most incorrigible class of the community. A passion for splendour, for expensive amusements and distinctions, is commonly found in that description of women who w ould become the subject of such a law, not less inordinate than their other appetites. A severity of the kind proposed applies immediately to that passion; and there is no room for any complaint of injustice, since the provisions above stated, with others which might be contrived, confine the punishment, so far as it is possible, to the person of the offender; suffering the estate to remain to the heir, or within the family of the ancestor from whom it came, or to attend the appointments of his will.\n",
      "“Sentences of the ecclesiastical courts, which release the parties a vinculo matrimonii, by reason of impuberty, frigidity, consanguinity within the prohibited degrees, prior marriage, or want of the requisite consent of parents or guardians, are not dissolutions of the marriage contract, but judicial declarations that there never was any marriage; such impediment subsisting at the time as rendered the celebration of the marriage rite a mere nullity. And the rite itself contains an exception of these impediments. The man and woman to be married are charged t if they know' any impediment why they may not be lawfully joined together, to confess it ;’ and assured, ‘ that so many as are coupled together, otherwise than God’s word doth allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful ;’ all which is intended by way of solemn notice to the parties, that the vow they are about to make will bind their consciences and authorize their cohabitation only upon the supposition that no legal impediment exist.”\n",
      "By the law of Scotland, a divorce may be obtained on the ground either of adultery or of wilful desertion; but neither of these grounds dissolves the marriage ipso jure; and if a process of divorce be not instituted, the marriage subsists, notwithstanding the adultery or desertion. Until recently the action of divorce proceeded before the commissaries of Edinburgh; and in every such action, whether founded on adultery or desertion, the pursuer must make oath that the action is not collusive. The legal effect of divorce on the ground of desertion is, that the offending party loses the “tocher,” as it is called, and the donationes propter nuptias ; that is, the offending husband is bound to restore the dowry, and to pay or make good to the wife all her provisions, legal or conventional; and the offending w ife forfeits her dowry, and all that would have come to her had the marriage been dissolved by the predecease of her husband. It is now held that recrimination is not a good defence against divorce for adultery; yet, as the mutual guilt may affect the patrimonial interests of the parties, it may be stated in a counter-action. But lenocinium, or the husband’s participation in the profits of his wife’s prostitution, nay even the husband’s connivance in her guilt, is a good defence to the wife against an action of divorce on the ground of adultery. The statute 1600, c. 20, declares marriages contracted between the adulterer and the person with whom he or she may be found, by the sentence of divorce, to have committed the crime, to be null and unlawful, and the issue of such marriages to be incapable of succeeding to their parents; but the act, nevertheless, has not the effect of bastardizing such issue. The right to institute a divorce is personal to the husband or wife; but if, after the action has been raised, either party die before the decree of divorce becomes final, it has been argued that the natural dissolution of the marriage by death supersedes and definitively closes all proceeding commenced for dissolving it on any other ground. The natural dissolution, it has been contended, is the first effectual one, and that which is to regulate all questions as to the patrimonial rights or the status of the survivor. But the question how far litiscontestation in such a case renders it transmissible to representatives, has .not yet, we believe, been decided.\n",

      "the most learned of Scotish schoolmasters in modern times, was born in the year 1719. His father, who was a small fanner in the county of Forfar, died when he was yet in his infancy; and his mother contracted a second marriage with a worthy man, who, though by no means in affluent circumstances, and soon burdened with children of his own, treated him with the tenderness of a parent. A constitutional defect in his sight prevented him from learning to read till he was twelve years of age, but his subsequent progress was uncommonly rapid. Having for the space of three years attended a parochial school, where he was instructed in writing, arithmetic, and Latin, he became a successful competitor for a bursary, or exhibition, in the university of St Andrews. Here he completed the usual course with great approbation; and, having taken the degree of A. B. he enrolled himself as a student of divinity, but his scruples respecting some articles in the Confession of Faith prevented him from entering the church. What those articles were, we have not discovered; but it appears sufficiently evident that his scruples had no reference to the essential doctrines of Christianity. Reconciling himself to the more humble avocations of a parochial schoolmaster, he for a considerable number of years taught the schools of Monifieth in his native county, and of Kennoway and Falkland in the county of Fife. He was afterwards appointed master of the grammar school of Stirling; and this office, as a late writer remarks, he discharged for forty years with the greatest ability, and with the respect and esteem of all who knew him.\n",
      "His accomplishments, not only as a classical scholar, but as a man of general erudition, procured him no mean reputation long before he was known as an author. Of his extensive knowledge of languages, the earliest specimen which he imparted to the public is to be found in about twenty pages of annotations on the Gaberlunzie-man, inserted in an edition published by his learned friend and neighbour Mr Callander.^[1. Two ancient Scottish Poems, the Gaberlunzie-man, and Christ’s Kirk on the Green: with notes and observations, by John Callander, Esq. of Craigforth∙ Edinb. 1782, 8vo. ] His contribution is introduced in the following terms: “For the following elucidations of the general principles laid down in the preface, and exemplified in the notes on the foregoing ballad, the public and I are indebted to a learned and worthy friend of the author, ŵhose extensive erudition is only equalled by the modesty and candour conspicuous in his whole deportment. I am sure our learned readers will regret with me, that he has not pushed his researches further than he has done. But from the little he has here given us, the general principles of etymology I have endeavoured to establish will derive new force, and our readers new entertainment.” Although his learning did not procure him any academical preferment, it at least procured him a due share of academical honours. On the same day he received a diploma of A. Μ. from St Andrews, and another of LL. D. from Glasgow 1 .\n",
      "After an interval of ten years, he published “Two Letters on the Savage State, addressed to the late Lord Kaims.” Lond, 1792, 8vo. This work, which consists of 157 crown pages, is dedicated to Dr Horne, bishop of Norwich, and is introduced by a preface written by the author’s friend Dr Gleig, a learned episcopalian clergyman of Stirling. The first letter, written in 1775, was sent to Lord Kames, who was passing his Christmas vacation at Blair-Drummond, and who was much struck with the learning and ability of lìis anonymous correspondent. Having without much difficulty detected the author, he invited him to dine with him next day; when they met and parted with mutual satisfaction, but with no abatement of the confidence of either party in the correctness of his own views as to the primitive condition of the human race. After a very copious and free discussion of the savage state, each of the disputants retained his own opinion; but they nevertheless laid the foundation of a cordial friendship, which continued uninterrupted during the lifetime of the judge, who survived till the year 1782. It was scarcely to be anticipated that his lordship should abandon the favourite paradox which pervades his Sketches of the History of Man; namely, that the tribes of mankind were originally placed in the condition of savages, from which they were enabled to emerge by the slow and gradual operation of certain instinctive principles implanted in their nature. This was a paradox which he did not himself devise, but which had already been exhibited in a variety of shapes by Condillac, Rousseau, Hume, Smith, Monboddo, and divers other speculators. Some of these lovers of wisdom delight in representing the human species as very closely allied to what we venture to describe as the lower animals; and whether the remote ancestors of men were not downright monkies, or at least ourang-outangs, they feel a very philosophical degree of hesitation in deciding. Rousseau is much inclined to doubt whether certain animals resembling the human species, but by travellers supposed to be beasts, either on account of some difference in their external formation, or merely on account of their wanting the faculty of speech, are not in reality savage men, whose race being anciently dispersed in the forests, had never had occasion to develope any of the virtual faculties, had never attained to any degree of perfection, and therefore still continued in the primitive state of nature. A shaggy skin and a long tail he did not consider as infallible marks of distinction between one race of beings and another. If such individuals as Montesquieu, Buffon, Diderot, Duclos, d’Alembert, or Condillac, had appeared in the capacity of travellers into unknown regions, he would have been disposed to listen to them when they affirmed that one animal was a man, and another a beast; but he considers it as a piece of great simplicity to leave such a matter to the decision of stupid travellers, in relation to whom one might sometimes be tempted to raise a question similar to that which they take upon themselves to determine in the case of other animals.^[2. Rousseau, Discours sur l’Origine et les Fondemens de l’inégalité parmi les Hommes, p. 237∙ Amst. 1755, 8vo. “Je dis que quand de pareils observateurs affirmeront d’un tel animal que c’est un homme, et d’un autre que c’est une bête, il faudra les en croire; mais ce seroit une grande simplicité' de s’en rapporter là dessus à des voyageurs grossiers, sur lesquels on seroit quelque fois tente' de faire la même question qu’ils se mêlent de résoudre sur d’autres animaux.” ] The philosophers of this school are clearly of opinion that man, however created, was left to his own unaided exertions in the formation of an articulate language; but they are so intimately acquainted with the texture of human thought, that they find no difficulty in explaining the entire process which he must have followed. Dr Smith has ascertained that “the institution of nouns substantive” must have been one of the first steps towards the formation of language; and by another philosopher the geography of language is adjusted in a manner not less satisfactory; Rousseau thinks it highly probable that articulate speech must have taken its rise in islands, and must there have been carried to perfection before it was known on the continent.\n",
      "Dr Doig was of opinion that “had all mankind, without exception, been once in a state of absolute savagism, they would not only have continued in that state, but would have still sunk lower and lower, till they had at last, in a manner, put off the character of humanity, and degraded themselves to the level of the beasts that perish.” All the learning, religion, laws, arts, and sciences, and other improvements that have enlightened Europe, a great part of Asia, and the northern coast of Africa, were so many rays diverging from two points, on the banks of the Euphrates and the Nile. In proportion as nations receded from these two sources of humanity and civilization, in the same proportion were they more and more immersed in ignorance and barbarism. “I think it obvious, beyond all possibility of contradiction,” he adds, “that all those nations, and societies of men which were removed to a considerable distance from the grand sources of civilization above-mentioned, had early degenerated into a state of savagism; that this degeneracy encreased exactly in proportion to their distance from those two points; that none of those nations who are known to have sunk into that state, ever became civilized, till they had renewed their correspondence with nations, or individuals, who had derived light and knowledge from the oriental sources;^[3. Relative to the barbarism and civilization of Greece, the following passage occurs in the work of a very ancient philosopher : ∏aλ- λax∣s yap κaι γtγovt ×aι iστaι ßaļßaças il 'Ελλ«;, o'υχ ι vπ' àvûįutraiv µovov γιvι>μlvr l μsτava<rτaτ0S∙> άλλα και i>π ’ aiιτns τr∣s <ξ>υσzωs aù μιiζ<nt>s aùĩs μn-οοί aLrr,s γιvoμmr∣s, iλλa κa∣ wτ i .ζaι άη, τζt>s iιμaf iζχ>ιv λaμβawurηs. (Ocellus Lucanus de Universi Natura, cap. iii. edit. Gale 1688.) ] that previous to the opening of this correspondence, no one s people discovered the least propension or. tendency towards culture and civilization; that, consequently, had all mankind been, at any one period, absolute savages, they would have continued in that unhappy state as long as the world existed; that if this train of reasoning should happen to be just, there must always have existed, in some part of the globe, a select society, a civilized race of men, among whom the knoλvledgc of arts and sciences was always preserved, and from whom the blessings of civilization, and a cultivated state of life, were, in process of time, propagated to all the other nations, which at this day enjoy these invaluable benefits.” T\n",

      "a practical and theoretical optician of the highest celebrity, the discoverer of the laws of the dispersion of light, and inventor of the achromatic telescope, descended from a family of French refugees, was born in London on the 10th June 1706.\n",
      "His first destination was the manufactory which afforded employment to the greater part of the French colony established in Spittaifields, and he passed some of his earlier years in the mechanical labour of a silk-weaver. He was, however, always attached to the mathematics and to natural philosophy, and he even extended his studies to the outlines of anatomy and of scholastic divinity; and in the pursuit of these objects he found himself obliged to acquire a competent knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages, a task which was much facilitated to him by the possession of a memory no less retentive than his observation was accurate and his reasoning correct. He married early, and he continued in his first occupation till he had established his eldest son, Peter Dollond, who inherited his own tastes as an optical instrument maker; and the success of the undertaking was such as to induce him, in 1752, to leave his own business, and to enter into partnership with his son in Vine Court.\n",
      "These arrangements having taken place, it was not long before Mr Dollond communicated to the Royal Society some of the results of the application of his inventive powers to his new pursuits; and Mr Short, who then enjoyed the highest reputation as an optician, paid him the compliment of bringing them forward to the Society under the auspices of his name.\n",

The author here describes a telescope with six glasses, as calculated for correcting, either wholly or in great measure, the errors of refraction arising from the dispersion of the different colours, as well as from the spherical form of the surfaces of the eye-glasses; appealing to the superiority of the telescopes which he had thus constructed, to those which had before been in use; but he reserves a more ample detail of the theory for a future occasion, which, however, does not appear to have presented itself, the improvement having been superseded by others incomparably more important.\n",

It is remarkable with what profound respect the experiments of Newton are treated in Mr Dollonďs letter: “It is somewhat strange,” he says, “that any body now-a-days should attempt to do that which so long ago has been demonstrated impossible.” But although the investigation of truth was perhaps in this instance retarded, yet its ultimate discovery was not prevented by a just deference to a high authority.

The apparatus is recommended as particularly calculated to be applied to a reflecting telescope, and was afterwards adapted by Mr Peter Dollond to the improved achromatic telescopes. Mr Savery and Mr Bouguer had before used two separate lenses in a manner nearly similar; bût the employment of a single glass divided affords a much more convenient arrangement.\n",

      "5. An Account of some Experiments concerning the Different Refrangibility of Light. Phil. Trans. 1758, p. 733. We have here the important results of a series of accurate experiments, by which the author had undertaken to investigate the foundations of the Newtonian theory of refraction; though he began them without any hope of a success so brilliant as that which ultimately crowned his labours.\n",
      "It was in the beginning of 1757 that Mr Dollond made the decisive experiment of putting a common prism of glass into a prismatic vessel of water, and varying the angle of the vessel till the mean refraction of the glass was compensated; when he found that the colours were by no means destroyed, as they were supposed to have been in a similar experiment related by Newton; for the remaining dispersion was nearly as great as that of a prism of glass of half the refracting angle. Mr Dollond then employed a thinner wedge of glass, and found that the image was colourless when the refraction of the water was about one fourth greater than that of the glass. He next attempted to make compound object-glasses by inclosing water between two lenses; but in this arrangement he found great inconvenience from the spherical aberration; so that lie was obliged to try the effects of different kinds of glass, and he fortunately discovered that the refractions of flint and crown glass were extremely convenient for his purpose, the image afforded by them being colourless when the angles were to each other nearly as two to three; and hence he inferred that a convex lens of crown glass and a convex one of flint would produce a colourless image when their focal distances were in the Same proportion. The spherical aberration, where the curvature was so considerable, still produced some inconvenience; but having four surfaces capable of variation, he was enabled to make the aberrations of the two lenses equal; and since they were in opposite directions, they thus corrected each other. All these arrangements required great accuracy of execution for their complete success; but, in the hands of the inventor, they produced the most admirable instruments, and he was singularly fortunate in obtaining a quantity of glass of more uniform density than has been since manufactured on so large a scale. He afterwards made some small Galilean telescopes with triple objectglasses, and Mr Peter Dollond applied this construction to the longer telescopes with compound eye-pieces, the alteration rendering the spherical aberration still more manageable.\n",
      "The merits of Mr Dollond’s inventions were promptly acknowledged on the part of the Royal Society by the adjudication of the Copleyan medal for the year. In 1761, he was appointed optician to the king, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; a distinction which is often obtained on easy terms by those whose situation in life exempts them from the suspicion of seeking it for any purpose degrading to science, but which is generally an object of considerable ambition to persons of mechanical or commercial occupations.\n",
      "A considerable share of the credit due to Mr Dollond’s discoveries has been very erroneously attributed by some late historians and biographers on the Continent to Leonard Euler, a mathematician who most assuredly has little need of the appropriation of the merits of others to establish his claim to immortality. But in fact the only idea of Euler that could be said to have furnished any hint to Mr Dollond, has been shown by the calculations of Dr Maskelyne, and by the experiments of Dr Thomas Young and Dr Wollaston, to have been completely erroneous; nor did Euler even admit the accuracy of Mr Dollond’s conclusions after his discovery was made, without considerable hesitation and scepticism. Mr Klingenstierna had simply expressed a doubt with respect to the result of Newton’s experiments, though he by no means suspected the extent of the error. Mr Peter Dollond has sufficiently vindicated his father’s claim to complete originality, in a paper read to the Royal Society in the year 1789; he has also suggested an explanation of the origin of Newton’s mistake, by stating that there exists a kind of Venetian glass, of which the dispersive power little exceeds that of water, whilst its specific gravity nearly approaches to 2∙58, which is assigned by Newton to glass in general; and it certainly seems more probable that some such circumstance as this was the cause of the error, than that Newton should, as some have suspected, have mixed acetate of lead with the water which he used, for an experiment which was so much more likely to be satisfactory without it.\n",
      "Mr Dollond’s appearance was somewhat stern, and his language was impressive, but his manners were cheerful and affable. He was in the habit of attending regularly, along with his family, the service of the French Protestant church. He constantly sought his chief amusement in objects connected with the study of those sciences which he had so much contributed to improve. Perhaps, indeed, he pursued them with an application somewhat too intense; for on the 30th of November, as he was reading a new work of Clairaut on the theory of the moon, which had occupied his whole attention for several hours, he had an attack of apoplexy, which shortly became fatal. He left two sons and three daughters. His sons succeeded to his business; and the younger dying a few years afterwards, his place was filled by a nephew, who assumed the family name, and who still conducts the establishment with undiminished respectability and success.

      "a people of Greece, who derived their origin from those districts in which the Grecian nation bordered towards the north upon numerous and dissimilar races of barbarians. According to Herodotus, they were from early times one of the chief races of that nation, which, in fact, was composed of Dorians and Ionians; the one of Hellenic and the other of Pelasgic origin, the former a migratory and the latter an aboriginal race. In this definition it is assumed that the Pelasgi were Greeks and spoke the Grecian language in its elder form; an opinion in support of which many arguments might easily be produced. But all the races whose migrations took place at a comparatively late period, such as the Achaeans, Ionians, and Dorians, particularly the last, were not sufficiently numerous or powerful to effect a complete change in the customs of a barbarous population: many districts, as Arcadia and Perrhaebia, remained entirely Pelasgic, without being inhabited by any nation not of Grecian origin: the most ancient names either of Grecian places, or those mentioned in the traditions of the Grecian race, belonged indeed to a different era of the dialect, but not to a different language: and, lastly, the great similarity between the Latin and the Greek can only be explained by supposing the Pelasgic language to have formed the connecting link. The Dorians are mentioned in ancient legends and poems as having been established in one extremity of the great mountain chain of Upper Greece, namely, at the foot of Mount Olympus; but there are, nevertheless, many reasons for supposing that, at a period still earlier than that to which these monuments refer, they dwelt at its other extremity, reaching to the farthest limit of the Grecian nation. Indeed the Doric Hylleans had a tradition that they came originally from those northern districts which bordered on the Illyrians, and were afterwards occupied by that people; a tradition, we may observe, which many facts and circumstances unite to confirm, or at least to render highly probable. Be this as it may, however, the earliest ascertained seat of the Dorians was the district of Mount Olympus. But, either from a restless and wandering disposition, or impelled by the pressure of some northern hordes, they seem to have migrated from this district into Crete, that is, from one end of the Grecian world to the other; thus presenting a striking anomaly in the history of the ancient colonies. The earliest trace of this circumstance is found in the Odyssey, where it is mentioned that the “thrice divided” (τg∕^α∕xis) Dorians formed part of the population of Crete. Though originally inhabiting a mountainous region, they appear, in course of time, to have become, as it were, the Normans of Greece, and to have sought settlements wherever they could find them. But the most important, and the most fertile in consequences, of all the migrations of the Grecian races, and that which continued even to the latest period to exert its influence upon the Greek character, was the expedition of the Dorians into the Peloponnesus. This circumstance is mentioned by Herodotus, who states that, under Deucalion, they dwelt in Phthiotis, and in the time of Dorus, the son of Helen, inhabited the country at the foot of Ossa and Olympus, called Hestiaeotis; that, afterwards, being driven from Hestiaeotis by the Kad-means, they dwelt under Mount Pindus, and were called the Macednian nation; that thence they again migrated to Dryopis, and from Dryopis passed into the Peloponnesus, where they were cŭlled the Doric race. The traditionary name of the expedition in question is “the Return of the descendants of Hercules,” who are admitted to have been of Doric origin; and, in process of time, successive conquests were effected by them in the Peloponnesus, until the whole of that country was at length subdued and occupied by the Dorians. Argos was captured by this people; Sicyon was conquered from Argos, Phlius from Sicyon, and Cleonae from Argus. The Dorians expelled the Ionians from Epidaurus, and afterwards reduced AEgina and Troezen; they appear also to have made themselves masters of Corinth and Megara; and, under Aristodemus, they conquered Laconia, which soon afterwards rose into great importance among the states of Greece. In due time, Doric colonies from Argos, Epidaurus, and Troezen established themselves on the south-west coast of Asia Minor; and other colonies of the same race also settled in different parts of the same country, where, at a very early period, we find them forming a league against the Ionians, whom they had either encroached upon or expelled. In fact, there is nothing so remarkable in the history of this remarkable race as its extraordinary propagation and diffusion. In course of time it spread itself on all sides, from Greece to Asia Minor, Byzantium, Syracuse, and the country which sweeps round the Gulf of Tarentum, including the territory afterwards known by the name of Magna Graecia, with Crotona, Locri, and Lyctus, to say nothing of Chalcis, Solium, Ambracia, Anactorium, Leucadia, Corcyra, Epidamnus, Apollonia, Potidaea, Chalcedon, Trogilus, Thap-sos, Selinus, and other places, which it conquered or colonized. It is remarkable that, wherever any portion of Doric invaders or settlers proceeded, they not only carried along with them, but gave a permanent ascendancy to the peculiarities and characteristics of their race. Their religion, their laws, their literature, their manners, and in short all that distinguished them as a separate people, appear to have taken root wherever they pitched their tents; and it is by the vestiges which still remain of their migrations, settlements, and power, that we are enabled to trace with some degree of certainty events which either took place before the commencement of authentic history r , or in regard to which history, tradition, and even fable, are alike silent. The limits of this article, however, preclude our entering into details, which in fact would require volumes for their full development and illustration. We shall therefore confine ourselves to some general remarks on the character of the Dorians, deduced from the masterly analytical investigations of Professor Müller in his History and Antiquities of the Doric Race ; a work not more distinguished for its almost boundless erudition, than for the critical sagacity and philosophic spirit which is displayed in it throughout.\n",
      "And the first peculiarity in the Doric character which we shall notice, is the tendency which it exhibited to produce uniformity and unity. Every individual was destined to remain within those limits which were prescribed by the will of the whole; every one was bound to obey in his own place. All the smaller associations were regulated on the same principle; there was a gradation of power, but never independent equality. The Dorians, also, had little inclination to admit the customs of others, and a strong desire to disconnect themselves from foreigners; their instinct seems to have been to adhere scrupulously to their own national habits, and to preserve that distinct individuality of national character which appears to have given them so decided an ascendency over all the races amongst which they intermingled or settled. They loved independence, and knew well how to maintain and defend it. A calm and steady courage was the natural quality of the Dorians; and though they sometimes yielded to the impetuosity of excitable and enthusiastic enemies, their fortitude and pertinacity commonly secured them the\"victory, and almost always prevented defeat from degenerating into disaster. As they were not ready to receive, neither were they prone to communicate, outward impressions; and hence, both in their poetry and prose, the narrative is often concealed by expressions of the feeling, and tinged as it were with the hue and colour of the mind. They endeavoured always to condense and concentrate their thoughts, which was the cause of the great brevity and obscurity of their language; and as their attention was turned to the past rather than the future, they cherished an ardent attachment to the usages and manners of their forefathers, as embodied and preserved in their actual institutions. Hence the Dorians preserved most rigidly, and represented most truly, the customs of the ancient Greeks. They were not a stationary, far less a retrograding people; but the advances which they made were slow, and all their changes imperceptible.\n",
      "With the desire to attain uniformity, for which the Dorians were distinguished, there was also combined in their character another remarkable peculiarity; namely, a love for measure and proportion. Their works of art are conspicuously marked by this attention to singleness of effect; and every thing discordant or useless was pruned off with an unsparing hand. Their moral system also prescribed the observance of the proper medium in all things; and it was in this that the temperance which so distinguished them consisted; it was the synonyme, not of abstinence, but of moderation. One great object of the worship of Apollo, which the Dorians introduced into Greece, was to maintain undisturbed the balance of the mind, and to remove every thing calculated to disquiet the thoughts, inflame the passions, or overcloud the serenity of the soul. The nature of this singular race seems to have required an equal and regular harmony; and for this reason dissonances, even if combined into harmony, were by no means suited to their taste. The national song was doubtless not remarkable for soft or pleasing melody; and the general accent of the language had the tone aζ>d character of command, without any of that delicacy or flexibility which are required in Elysian airs or Lydian measures. But the Dorians were contented with themselves, and with the powers to which they owed their existence and their happiness; in almost every sense, they were a self-concentred race, living in themse\n",

      "an English county, situated on the south-western coast. In British times, and previous to the landing of Caesar, it was inhabited by the Durotriges and Morini, two appellations derived from the British language, and signifying dwellers on the coasts of the ocean. By the Romans this county constituted a portion of Eritannia Prima; and the Saxons called it Dorsetta (a word having the same meaning as the above British appellation), and included it in the kingdom of Wessex. Kingston Hall and Corfe Castle are mentioned as royal residences.\n",
      "On the north Dorsetshire is bounded by Somersetshire and Wiltshire, on the east by Hampshire, on the west by Devonshire and a part of Somersetshire, while the British Channel bounds it on the south. The irregularities of its form prevent its being compared to any determinate figure; the northern boundary has a considerable angular projection in the middle; the southern coast runs out in various points and headlands; and the western coast inclines towards Devonshire, with an irregular line. Its greatest length from north to south is about thirty-five miles, and its breadth from east to west fifty-five; its circumference, including about 775,000 acres, is nearly 160 miles.\n",
      "Dorsetshire is divided into thirty-four hundreds, containing more than 390 parishes, nine boroughs, and twenty-two market-towns, the principal of which are Dorchester, Bridport, Sherborne, Lyme-Regis, Shaftesbury, Wareham, Weymouth, Melcombe Regis, Poole, and Blandford. This county formerly returned twenty members to the House of Commons; but by the recent law it will only elect thirteen, viz. three for the county, two for Dorchester and for Poole, and the two boroughs of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, now formed into one, will elect two members; Bridport, Lyme, Shaftesbury, and λVarcham, each of which towns returned two, will in future elect but one. Corfe Castle has been disfranchised. Dorsetshire forms part of the see of Bristol. Its bishop was established at Sherborne by Henry the Eighth, but was shortly added to the diocese of Bristol. In remote times it had been a part of the sees of Oxford, of Salisbury, and of Winchester successively.\n",
      "The surface of Dorsetshire is hilly and uneven. A great portion of the county has the appearance of downs, open and uninclosed portions, covered with sheep. More sheep are pastured in the neighbourhood of Dorchester than in any other district, though great numbers of both sheep and oxen are fed in the valley of Blackmore, which is celebrated as rich pasture land, containing upwards of 170,000 acres. There are also in this district several orchards, producing excellent cider. On the south-western side there are many'vales of great luxuriance; but on the south-eastern there is much waste land, dreary and barren, hardly supporting, even in the summer months, a few sheep and cattle, and supplying the neighbouring villages with heath for fuel. Even in this region, however, cultivation is advancing, and detached portions are improved. The turnpike-roads in this county are numerous, rendering travelling easy änd commodious.\n",
      "These downs are principally of a light chalky soil, with a turf remarkably fine, producing hay, in the inclosed parts, of an excellent quality, on which beasts will thrive well in winter without any other food. About Bridport the lower lands are mostly a deep rich loam; but on the hills, throughout the western district, the soil is a sandy loam, intermixed with flint, -well adapted for the growth of beech. To the north of Sherborne, where is some of the best land in the county for the plough, it is a stone brack, which is the case in the Isle of Portland and the Isle of Purbeck. In the centre of the county the soil is good and the land well managed.\n",
      "Dorsetshire is not awell-ŵöodëđ county; and, in general, native timber is scarce and dear. In some local spots, where the land is cold and wet, such as Duncliff in the vale of Blackmore, Heycombc Wood in the vale of Sherborne, and others of a similar nature, some plantations may be seen.\n",
      "The air of Dorsetshire is remarkably mild and salubrious; which, added to the beauty of its scenery, has obtained for it the appellation of the Garden of England. Weymouth has long been celebrated as a fashionable watering-place; and, owing,to the general calmness of the sea there, its pleasant situation, and its commodiousness for bathing, it has, through the frequent visits of the royal family, risen to great consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief port in the county is Poole, situated on an estuary formed by the mouth of the Frome. Its entrance is defended by Brownsea Castle, and it is very secure in all winds. It is the chief place for equipping ships for the Newfoundland fishery; and considerable trade is carried on from it with Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean. Swanage, Weymouth, Bridport, and Lyme have harbours capable of admitting small vessels only.\n",
      "The rivers of Dorsetshire are the Frome, the Stour, the Piddle, and the Ivel. The Frome rises in the north-western part of the county, near Evershot; and, passing by Dorchester, reaches Poole, and falls into its bay. The Stour enters this county from Wiltshire, near Gillingham, and, pursuing a southern and south-eastern direction, enters Hampshire. The Piddle rises in the north, and, flowing to the south-east, unites with Poole Bay. The Ivcl, anciently Yoo, has its origin from several springs near Hore-thorn, in a hill north-east from Sherborne, from which town it flows into Somersetshire, and falls into the Parret.\n",
      "Although neither coal nor any metallic ores have ever been worked in Dorsetshire, the stone quarries of Purbeck and Portland have long been celebrated. Purbeck, though called an island, is more properly a peninsula, of an irregular oval form, about twelve miles in length and seven in breadth. The soil is altogether calcareous, and for the most part a continued mass, either of white or a brownish limestone, the latter having a mixture of sea-shells. The quarries on the south side of the isle afford an inexhaustible fund of natural curiosities. The best quarries are at Kingston, Worth, Langton, and Swanwick. The Swanwick stone is white, full of shells, takes a polish, and looks like alabaster. About Wareham and Morden is found a stone of an iron colour, called fire-stone. Near Dunshay, marble of various colours, blue, red, gray, and spotted, is dug up; but all of a coarse grain. Much of the stone of this district was used in the building of St Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Bridge, and Ramsgate Pier, and may be discovered in many of our ancient cathedrals, churches, grave-stones, and monuments. One of the most valuable products of Purbeck is a white clay used for making pipes, and very extensively applied to the manufacture of China. Large quantities of it are dug, and many vessels loaded with it for Staffordshire, at Russell Quay, within the port of Poole.\n",
      "The rocks in the Isle of Portland rise frequently to 100 or 150 feet in height, and large masses lie scattered on the shore. These are composed of calcareous grit, containing moulds or larox of various shells, and emitting, when rubbed with steel, a bituminous smell. The grit is cemented together by a calcareous paste. The quarries are scattered among these rocks, more or less, in every part of the isle; but those of most repute are at Kingston. At this place there is a pier, whence upwards of 6000 tons of stone, on an average, are supposed to be shipped off annually. The first stratum in these quarries is about one foot of blackish or reddish earth; then six feet of stone, not fit for exportation. Below this is the bed of good stone, ten or twelve feet deep, and beneath it flint or clay. The stratum of stone that is worked for sale lies nearly parallel with the upper surface of the island, and without much earth or rubbish on it. When the beds are cleared, the quarrymen proceed to cross-cut the large flats, which is done with wedges. The beds being cut into distinct lumps, are squared by the hammer to the largest size which it will admit; and blocks are thus formed from half a ton to six or eight tons weight. The colour of the Portland stone, or free stone as it is sometimes called, from the freedom with which it maybe broken into any shape, is well known, as almost white, and as composing the materials of the most splendid erections in London, as well as in other parts of the British empire.\n",
      "The general practice and management of tillage in this county is less attended to than any part of agriculture; for it appears to be the plan of the farmers to put the seed into the ground with as few ploughings as possible. The sowing of wheat is often effected with one ploughing; and symmetry and neatness are so much disregarded, that, in small pieces of land, the ploughman will vary three or four yards from a straight line. The plough used is called a sull, and is long, large, and heavy, with one small wheel at the side of the beam, and worked by four horses or six oxen, two abreast. In the neighbourhood of the towns, land lets for from forty to fifty shillings the acre; and, in general, arable land from twenty to thirty.\n",
      "Barley is found to make the best returns; and from 10,000 to 12,000 bushels of salt are annually made in some of the towns. Flax and hemp are objects of great importance about Bridport, Bradford, and Beminster. The seed is imported from Riga, and the average crop is from fifty to sixty dozen pounds per acre, worth from four shillings and sixpence to seven shillings per dozen. It is a precarious crop, depending very much on the season; and hence the quantity cultivated has of late years been gradually diminished.\n",
      "The sheep of Dorsetshire have long been celebrated. They are horned, white faced, with long small white legs, the carcass rather long and thin, the mutton fine grained and of good flavour, weighing per quarter, in wethers at three years and a half old, from sixteen to twenty pounds. Their wool is fine and short\n",

      "a celebrated English admiral, was the son of Edmund Drake, a sailor, and was born near Tavistock, in Devonshire, in the year 1545. He was brought up at the expense and under the care of Sir John Hawkins, who was his kinsman, and, at the age of eighteen, was the purser of a ship trading to Biscay. At twenty he made a voyage to Guinea, and at twenty-two he was made captain of the Judith. In that capacity he was in the harbour of San Juan de Ulloa, in the Gulf of Mexico, where he behaved most gallantly in the actions under Sir John Hawkins, and returned with him to England, having acquired great reputation, though not worth a groat. Upon this he projected an attack against the Spaniards in the West Indies; a project which he no sooner published than he found volunteers enow ready to accompany him. In 1570 he undertook an expedition with two ships, and the next year with only one, in which he returned safe, if not with such advantages as he had expected. In 1572 he made another expedition, in which he did the Spaniards some mischief, and gained considerable booty. In these expeditions he was much assisted by a nation of Indians, who were then engaged in a sort of chronic warfare with the Spaniards. The prince of these people was named Pedro, to whom Drake presented a fine cutlass from his side, which he saw the Indian greatly admired. Pedro, in return, gave him four large wedges of gold; which Drake threw into the common stock, saying that lie thought it but just that such as on his credit bore the charge of so uncertain a voyage, should share the utmost advantage which that voyage produced. Then having embarked his men with all the wealth he had obtained, which λvas very considerable, he bore away for England, where he arrived in August 1573.\n",
      "His success in this expedition, joined to his honourable behaviour towards his owners, gained him high reputation, and the use which he made of his riches a still higher. Haviŋg fitted out three frigates at his own expense, he sailed with them to Ireland; and there, under Walter earl of Essex, the father of the famous but unfortunate earl, he served as a volunteer, and performed many glorious actions. After the death of his patron, he returned to England, where Sir Christopher Hatton introduced him to her majesty Queen Elizabeth, and procured him countenance and protection at court. By this means he acquired the means of undertaking that grand expedition which has rendered his name immortal. The first proposal he made was to undertake a voyage into the South Seas through the Straits of Magelhaens; an achievement which no Englishman had hitherto ever attempted. This project having been well received at court, the queen furnished him with means; and his own fame quickly drew together a sufficient force. The fleet with which he sailed on this enterprise consisted only of five vessels, small when compared with the size of modern ships, and having on board no more than a hundred and sixty-four able men. Having sailed on the 13th of December 1577, he on the 25th fell in with the coast of Barbary, and on the 29th with Cape Verde. On the 18th of March he passed the equinoctial, made the coast of Brazil on the 5th of April, and entered the river Plata, where he parted company with two of his ships; but having met them again, and taken out their provisions, he turned them adrift. On the 29th of May he entered the port of St Julian’s, where he continued two months for the sake of laying in a stock of provisions. On the 20th of August he entered the Straits of Magelhaens, and on the 25th of September passed them, having then only his own ship. On the 25th of November he arrived at Macao, which he had appointed as the place of rendezvous in the event of his ships being separated; but Captain Winter, his vice-admiral, having repassed the straits, had returned to England. He thence continued his voyage along the coast of Chili and Peru, taking all opportunities of seizing Spanish ships, and attacking them on shore, till his men were satiated with plunder; and then, coasting America to the height of forty-eight degrees, he endeavoured to find a passage that way back into the Atlantic, but could not, because none exists. However, he landed, and called the country New Albion, taking possession of it in the name and for the use of Queen Elizabeth; and having careened his ship, he set sail from thence on the 29th September 1579, for the Moluccas. He is supposed to have chosen this passage round, partly to avoid being attacked by the Spaniards at a disadvantage, and partly because, from the lateness of the season, dangerous storms and hurricanes were apprehended. On the 13th of October he fell in with certain islands inhabited by the most barbarous people he had met with in all his voyage. On the 4th of November he got sight of the Moluccas; and, arriving at Ternate, was extremely well received by the king of that place, who appears from the most authentic relations of this voyage to have been a wise and politic prince. On the 10th of December he made the Celebes, where his ship unfortunately struck upon a rock on the 9th of January following; but, beyond all expectation, they got her off, and continued their course. On the 16th of March he arrived at Java, whence he intended to have directed his course to Malacca; but he found himself obliged to alter his purpose, and to think of returning home. On the 25th of March 1580, he put this design in execution; and on the 15th of June he doubled the Cape of Good Hope, having then on board only fifty-seven men and three casks of water. On the l2th of July he passed the line, reached the coast of Guinea on the 16th, and there watered. On the 11th of September he made the island of Terceira, and on the 3d of November he entered the harbour of Plymouth. This voyage round the world was performed in two years and about ten months. Shortly after his arrival, the queen having gone to Deptford, went on board his ship, and there, after dinner, conferred upon him the honour of knighthood, at the same time declaring her entire approbation of all that he had done. She likewise gave directions for the preservation of his ship, that it might remain a monument of his own and his country’s glory. In the year 1585, he sailed with a fleet to the West Indies, and took the cities of St Jago, St Domingo, Carthagena, and St Augustine. In 1587 he went to Lisbon with a fleet of thirty sail; and having received intelligence of a great fleet being assembled in the bay of Cadiz, and destined to form part of the armada, he with great courage entered the port, and there burnt upwards of 10,000 tons of shipping; a feat which he afterwards merrily called “burning the king of Spain’s beard.” In 1588, when the Spanish armada was approaching our shores, Sir Francis Drake was appointed vice-admiral under Charles Lord Howard of Effingham, high-admiral of England; and here fortune favoured him as remarkably as ever; for he made prize of a very large galleon, commanded by Don Pedro de Valdez, who was reputed the projector of the invasion. This affair deserves to be particularly stated. On the 22d of July, Sir Francis observing a great Spanish ship floating at a distance from both fleets, sent his pinnace to summon the commander to yield. Valdez replied, with much Spanish solemnity, that they were four hundred and fifty strong, that he himself was Don Pedro, and stood much upoh his honour; and thereupon propounded several conditions, upon which he was willing to yield. But the vice-admiral replied, that he had no leisure to parley; that if the Don thought fit instantly to yield, he might; if not, he should soon find that Drake was no coward. Pedro, hearing the name of Drake, immediately yielded, and with forty-six of his attendants came on board the admiral’s ship. This Don Pedro remained about two years Sir Francis Drake’s prisoner in England; and when he was released, paid for his own and his captain’s liberty a ransom of L.3500. Drake’s soldiers were well recompensed with the plunder of this ship, for they found in it 55,000 ducats of gold, which were divided amongst them.\n",
      "A little before this formidable Spanish armament put to sea, the ambassador of his Catholic majesty had the confidence to propose to Queen Elizabeth, in Latin verse, the terms upon which she might hope for peace. The lines embodying this singular diplomatic communication are as follow:\n",
      "Te veto ne pergas bello defendere Belgas;\n",
      "Quae Dracus eripuit nunc restituantur oportet: Quas pater evertit jubeo te condere cellas: lleligio Papae fac restituatur ad unguem.\n",
      "To these the queen made this extempore response:\n",
      "Ad Graecas, bone rex, fiant mandata kalendas.\n",
      "In the year 1559, Sir Francis Drake commanded the fleet sent to restore Dom Antonio, king of Portugal, the land forces being under the orders of Sir John Norris; but they had hardly put to sea when the commanders differed, and thus the attempt proved abortive. But as the war with Spain continued, a more formidable expedition was fitted out, under Sir John Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake, against their settlements in the W r est Indies, than had hitherto been undertaken during the whole course of it. Here, however, the commanders again disagreed about the plan; and the result in like manner disappointed public expectation. Before these two last expeditions, all difficulties had given way to the skill and fortune of Sir Francis Drake; and this probably was the reason why he did not bear these disappointments so well as he might otherwise have done. A strong sense of them is supposed to have thrown him into a melancholy, which occasioned a bloody flux, of which he died on board his own ship, near the town of Nombre de Dios, in the West Indies, on the 2Sth of January 1595-96. His death was lamented by the whole nation, and particularly by his countrymen, who had great reason to love him from the correctness of his private life, as well as to esteem him on account of his public \n",

      "This term usually signifies the extinction of life by total submersion; but it ought also to be applied to that species of suffocation which is produced by the exclusion of atmospheric air from the lungs by any liquid; for the effects produced in all such cases are similar. Drowning, therefore, may be considered as having taken place when the animal perishes from immersion of its head, or even from the obstruction to the air passages by a fluid.\n",
      "The ordinary phenomena of drowning maybe witnessed by submerging a small animal in a glass vessel filled with water. The animal at first struggles violently, and is soon observed to make a forcible expiration, as is indicated by the escape of bubbles of air from its mouth and nose. It next attempts to inspire; an effort marked by the strong heaving of its thorax, and convulsive efforts of its abdominal muscles. This effort is vain, and is speedily followed by the extrication of a few more air bubbles from its lungs. These convulsive motions are repeated at shorter intervals, while smaller portions of air are forced from the lungs at each succeeding expiration, until the air cells are deprived of a considerable portion of the air they contained at the moment of submersion. Insensibility soon comes on; but convulsive movements of the limbs mark the progress of cerebral congestion, and the influence of unoxygenated blood on the centre of the nervous system.\n",
      "After these struggles, the animal is apparently dead; but a feeble motion may still be perceived in the chest; and before it ceases altogether, the muscles of the thorax are once more thrown into action by an ineffectual effort to breathe. Brodie has remarked, that in drowning, the action of the heart and diaphragm cease almost at the same instant. Unless the animal be removed from the water before the movements of the heart and diaphragm have entirely ceased, it perishes, and a minute or two more are sufficient to destroy it. If the animal be removed from the water while the heart and diaphragm are yet in action, it may escape from the immediate risk of suffocation, but yet may die from injury to the brain produced by congestion of dark blood on that organ. Bichat, Cruickshank, and Brodie, have proved, that dark unoxygenated blood acts as a poison on the brain, causing diminished nervous energy, laborious respiration, feeble pulse, dilated pupils, stupor, and convulsive twitches of the voluntary muscles.\n",
      "Signs of death from drowning. —The signs of death from đroyning arc external and internal. 1. The external signs most usually perceived are either a very pale countenance, or the face bloated and livid; the lips, and not unfrequently the whole head, swelled; the eyes half open, and the pupils much dilated; the tongue swelled, and protruded between the teeth, so as to be in contact with the inner surface of the lips; the lips and nose often lined with a whitish froth; the chest and epigastrium tumid, and much arched; the ends of the fingers usually excoriated; and the spaces under the nails often filled with sand or mud. 2. The most usual internal signs are more or less cerebral congestion; but in some cases no morbid change appears in the brain. We usually find the blood in the vessels of the head, and indeed in the whole body, of a blackish colour. There is generally frothy mucus in the trachaea, which is sometimes tinged with blood; the lungs are dilated and gorged with blood; the diaphragm descends low into the abdomen, and has lost more or less of its concave surface towards that cavity. The right cavities of the heart, and the great vessels connected with it, are gorged with black blood, whilst the left side and its vessels arc usually found empty. The blood in the body always remains fluid, and readily flows wherever an incision is made. Water is sometimes found in the bronchial tubes and cells of the lungs; and not unfrequently some water has been swallowed in the act of drowning. These symptoms will generally enable us to detect a death from drowning, if we examine the body before putrefaction is advanced.\n",
      "The immediate cause of death from drowning has given rise to much controversy; and physiologists have appealed to contradictory experiments and observations in support of their different hypotheses. But this difference of opinion has orginated in physiologists supposing that the suspension of the vital functions on submersion always depended on the same proximate cause. It is singular that the very dissimilar appearances which the face presents in different cases did not suggest some difference in the cause of death. In some drowned persons, the face is remarkably pale, and rather pinched; in others, the countenance is livid, and the whole head swelled; the first indicating the deficiency of blood in the head, the latter its redundancy. This led Dr Desgranges to the conclusion that there were two different modes in which drowning proved fatal.\n",
      "The first, which he terms nervous or syncopal asphyxia, occurs when the person, either from the terror of impending fate, the effect of surprise, or from the sudden immersion in extremely cold water, faints at the instant of immersion. The instantaneous arrestation of the movements of the heart in such cases prevents the transmission of unoxygenated blood to the brain; the principle of life is merely suspended; the resources of the animal machine are not destroyed, but are capable of being again called into action by suitable means. The second Desgranges terms asphyxia by suffocation. In this species the heart continues to act for some time after respiration is impossible. The brain thus becomes loaded with black or unoxygenated blood, which is known to act as a direct sedative or a poison on that delicate organ. When this has gone on for a short time, its functions are annihilated, and cannot be restored when the body is again exposed to asmospheric air. In this second species water often finds its way into the air tubes, and even into the cells of the lungs, during the vain efforts of the individual to breathe.\n",
      "These distinctions are important, will serve to explain most of the anomalies which have been observed as effects of submersion, and render probable the very extraordinary instances of resuscitation after long-continued submersion, which have been related by men worthy of credit, but which have appeared marvellous to those whose ideas of drowning are founded on a few experiments made on the lower animals forcibly submerged.\n",
      "Amongst individuals who have recovered from insensibility induced by long submersion, by far the majority are those who have been affected by syncopal asphyxia, in whom there has been instantaneous arrestation of the motion of the heart, and suspension of consciousness. This distinction will enable us also to explain why, when several persons are submerged together, some will be found quite irrecoverable; whilst others, who have been considerably longer under water, may be capable of resuscitation.\n",
      "The recovery from syncopal asphyxia is well illustrated by a case given by Plater. A female, condemned for infanticide, was inclosed in a sack, according to the provisions of the Caroline Code of Germany, and thrown into a lake. She fainted at the moment of immersion; and, after having been under water for a quarter of an hour, was drawn out and restored to life.\n",
      "Pouteau relates the history of a man at Lyons, who suddenly fell into a river covered with ice, and remained submerged for three hours, yet was restored to life by the long-continued assiduity of his medical attendant. Morgagni mentions the case of a man who was resuscitated after having been under water for half a day; and Pecklin relates the instance of a Swedish gardener, who was submerged in a frozen pond for sixteen hours, and yet was recovered by similar means.\n",
      "In all such cases, Desgrangcs conceives that the capability of recovery is to be attributed to the sudden arrestation of the vital motions at the moment of immersion. The action of the heart and of the lungs ceasing simultaneously, no vitiated blood could be transmitted to the brain. A stop would at the same time be put to all secretions and excretions, so that there could be no expenditure of vital power. How long this suspension might continue without extinction of vitality, is unknown; but something resembling it occurs in some long-continued paroxysms of hysteria, and in persons who have for several days lain apparently dead, but have been resuscitated.\n",
      "Drowning has been ascribed to water finding its way into the stomach and air passages; but this opinion was proved to be fallacious by Senac and Cullen. The former denied that water ever entered the lungs; but Morgagni showed that it actually does sometimes enter the air cells; and he ascribes the frothy mucus found in the fauces and air tubes to the intermixture of air with that water. The opinion of Morgagni on this last point is, however, incorrect; for the froth is found in many cases of asphyxia from noxious gases in epilepsy and apoplexy; and in the recent experiments of Dr M. Hall, it was observed in dogs that had been bled to death. It appears to be produced by the escape of air from the lungs mixing with the natural mucus lining the air passages, and indeed is common to all cases of laborious respiration. Goodwyn and Cullen showed the insufficiency of the water which finds its way into the lungs in drowning to cause speedy death.\n",
      "The excoriation of the ends of the fingers is produced by the person endeavouring to save himself by catching at the bottom, or the first solid which meets his hands; and the sand and mud under the nails have the same origin. In fact, we are, by these marks, often able to discover whether a person has been drowned, or thrown into the water after death. The tumid state of the chest, and descent of the diaphragm into the abdomen, are caused by the violent efforts made to dilate the chest, for the relief of the sense of suffocation. The fl\n",

      "of Logie-Almond, a distinguished scholar, acute philosopher, and accomplished writer, died at Rome, of a lingering and painful disease, on the 29th of March 1828. The date of his birth we have not been able to ascertain, and consequently cannot pretend to determine his age at the time of his decease.\n",
      "He seems to have been early ambitious of literary distinction, and in 1794 he published A Review of die Government of Sparta and Athens, large 8vo; a work which, though not destitute of merit, and exhibiting considerable traces of a vigorous mind, yet gave no promise of that bold spirit of speculation for which its author was afterwards so much distinguished. At the close of the year 1795, he was returned to parliament for the borough of St Mawes, in the representation of which a vacancy had occurred; and in the two following parliaments, which met respectively in 1796 and 1801, he sat for the town of Lostwithiel. At the time of his second election he had been appointed envoy-extraordinary to the court of Naples.\n",
      "In the year 1798, he published The Satires of Persius Translated, 8vo, which happened to appear about the same time with the rival translation of the Roman satirist by Mr Gifford, author of the Baviad and Maeviad, and afterwards editor of the Quarterly Review. This translation alone would have been sufficient to fix his reputation as an accomplished classical scholar; and, in point of fact, it has been much admired by all who are competent to appreciate the difficulty of the task which he so successfully performed. It would not be easy, indeed, to overrate the skill with which the niceties of Persius have been discriminated, or the felicity with which the idiomatic peculiarities of that difficult author have been converted into equivalent forms of expression. Drummond’s versification is easy, graceful, and precise; and though it wants the piquancy of allusion, the congenial bitterness of spirit, and the occasional point and concentration, which impart so strong a zest to the translation of Mr Gifford, it is yet distinguished for greater freedom and equal fidelity, two things which Drummond has shown that it is not impossible to reconcile.\n",
      "In the year 1801, Mr Drummond being then ambassador to the Ottoman Porte, was honoured with the order of the Crescent, which was confirmed by license, in the London Gazette, dated the 8th of September 1803.\n",
      "In 1805 Sir William published his Academical Questions, in 4to, and thereby greatly extended his fame as an author. Hitherto he had appeared only in the character of an elegant and accomplished scholar; but in this work he boldly entered the domain of philosophy, and in a free and fearless spirit attacked every species of dogmatism, whether consecrated by time, or sustained by authority, exposing the weakness of the human understanding, and mortifying the pride of pretended wisdom, by a collection of what appear to be insoluble cases and indeterminate problems. In this work, however, it is only the task of demolition which he proposes to accomplish; and it must be owned that he has spread abroad the rubbish and scattered the dust of philosophical systems in a somewhat appalling manner. “The author of Academical Questions,\" says the able critic of the work in the Edinburgh Review, “is indubitably a person of great reading, and much natural acuteness; but he has taken too wide a range, and indulged somewhat too much in a vein of controversial declamation. He often seems to think more of demolishing his antagonist than of enlightening his reader; and sometimes appears to enlarge upon a topic as much for the display of his eloquence as for the support of his reasoning. By frequent reference to the Greek writers, and continual allusions to the usages of antiquity, he expected perhaps to seduce the scholars of the South into metaphysical investigations, and to engage the attention of polite readers by a certain vivacity and polish in the turn of his expression. If this was his view, however, he certainly ought not to have plunged at first into the great gulf of substance and entity.” ŲEdinburgh Review, vol. vii. p. 185.) To these observations, however, it is proper to add, that the author avowedly reserved the full exposition of his own theory for a subsequent volume, though in point of fact it never appeared; and that in this preliminary publication he conceived himself to be only clearing out the foundation on which it was his intention afterwards to build.\n",
      "In the year 1810, Sir William Drummond, in conjunction with Robert Walpole, Esq. published Herculanensia, in 4to, containing archaeological and philological dissertations, and a copy of a manuscript found amongst the ruins of Herculaneum; and in 1811 appeared an Essay on a Punic Inscription found in the Isle of Malta, royal 8vo; both works of great merit and erudition. Sir William was also an occasional, if nota frequent, contributor to the Classical Journal ; in which his papers on subjects of antiquity, particularly the zodiac of Denderah, which occupied without exhausting his ingenuity, attracted the general admiration of the learned, if not always on account of their soundness, at least by reason of the acuteness and originality they display, and the resources of learning which the author had always at command for the illustration of his peculiar views. About this time, Sir William Drummond, whose residence at Constantinople had turned his attention to oriental literature, sacred as well as profane, consigned the fruits of his researches and investigations into the historical books of the Old Testament, in his OEdipus Jzιdaicus. This singular work was never published, having been printed solely for distribution amongst the author’s friends and acquaintance; but as he had caused a considerable impression to be struck off, copies of it soon found their way into the hands of persons connected with the periodical press, and those of others; and, as might have been expected, it was most fiercely attacked. The first onset was made by a churchman of the name of D’Oyly, in Letters to the Right lion. Sir William Drummond, in Defence of particular Passages of the Old Testament against his late work entitled “ OEdipus Judaicus and the attack was renewed in the Quarterly Review, with equal vigour and ability. Whether it was altogether fair thus openly to stigmatize a book which had never been published, we shall not stop to inquire; more especially as the principal cause of regret is, not that it was severely criticised, but that it was ever written, far less printed. In the controversy which thus arose, however, Sir William was overmatched, both in science and in Hebrew, with which D’Oyly and the Reviewer evinced a most intimate acquaintance; and although his reply displayed much ingenuity, no skill could evade, far less destroy, the force of some of the criticisms. The truth is, the allegorical theory which he undertook to establish was taken at secondhand from the work of Dupuis; and although the author, notwithstanding all the errors charged against him, brought great stores of learning and erudition to bear upon it, yet the absurdities to which it leads are so glaring, and the consequences which follow from it are so pernicious, that it is surprising Sir William Drummond should not have foreseen the one, or been prudent enough not to hazard the other. The preface, too, though beautifully written, contains observations which nothing can excuse, and irreverences so gross as even to shock persons the least scrupulous about subjects of religion. The profane joke about veal cutlets is worthy only of Mr Thomas Paine, and fit to appear in no work where the ordinary humanities of taste and reason are duly observed.\n",
      "In 1818 Sir William Drummond published, experimentally we believe, the first part of a poem entitled Odin, 4to, the object of which was to embody in verse some of the more striking features of the Scandinavian mythology. The poem, however, did not succeed in attracting public attention, which was then almost exclusively fixed on some of the great masters of song, whose deep voice of inspiration filled the land; and although it contained passages of very considerable power and beauty, it fell into almost immediate oblivion.\n",
      "But the work on which the reputation of Sir William Drummond as a scholar and antiquary must chiefly rest, is his Origines, or Remarks on the Origin of several Empires, States, and Cities, in 3 vols. 8vo. The first volume, embracing the origin of the Babylonian, the Assyrian, and the Iranian empires, appeared in 1824; the second, which is wholly devoted to the subject of Egypt, including the modern discoveries in hieroglyphics, came out in 1825; and the third, which treats of the Phoenicians and Arabia, was published in 1826. It would be exceedingly difficult, by a general statement, or by critical observations apart from details, to convey an accurate idea of the real character and merits of this work; which, with much that is strained, exaggerated, or defective, to say nothing of errors into which the author iŝ sometimes betrayed by the excessive refinements of an ever active ingenuity, is in several respects one of the most remarkable productions of modern times. A principal feature of the Origines, though certainly the least obtrusive, is, that here the author labours quietly to build up and fortify the authority of the historical books of the Old Testament, which, in the OEdipus Judaicus, he had (probably without intending it) contributed to impair, if not to pull down: whilst by concentrating, as it were, into one focus the various scattered lights of tradition, history, philosophy, science, etymology, and archaeology, he has contrived to illuminate many of the darkest passages in the records of the ancient world; to dispel no inconsiderable portion of the obscurity which overshadowed the origin and annals of the great empires of antiquity; and, even in the merest archaeological discussions, t\n",

      "much admired by strangers who arrive by sea, and deemed inferior only to the Bay of Naples in scenic grandeur, is very unsafe for shipping. It is five and a half miles wide at the entrance between the Point of Howth and Dalkey Island, and six miles deep to the mouth of the Liffey at Ringsend.' It is dangerous to navigators, being exposed to a heavy sea from the east. To guard against wreck, a lighthouse has been erected at the Point or Bailey of Howth, another on a pier projecting from the mouth of the Liffey, and a third on the Kish Bank, outside the bay. Two artificial harbours have also been constructed, the smaller at IIowth, occupying an area of fifty acres, at an expense of L.300,000. It is now little used. The other is at Dunleary or Kingstown, formed by two immense moles, including a space of 250 acres, from three to four fathoms deep at low water. Its entrance is marked by a revolving light. A small obelisk, surmounted by a regal crown, has been erected close to the pier, to point out the place where King George IV. took his departure from Dublin in 1821. The place of his previous landing at IIowth has not been marked by any similar memorial. A rail-road from Kingstown to Dublin has been commenced. The only other harbours are those of Balbriggen and Skerries, to the north of Howth. Each of them has been improved by artificial piers, but both are dry at low water. The former admits vessels of some size, and enjoys a small coasting trade. The latter is little more than a fishing station. The sailors are considered as among the most skilful and hardy on the eastern coast. They fish in decked wherries, manned by a full crew of twelve or fourteen hands, all of whom have a share in the boat, and consequently an interest in the capture of fish.\n",
      "The largest island on the coast is Lambay, to the north of Howth, comprehending somewhat more than 650 acres. A castle on it serves as the occasional residence of the proprietor. Shell-fish of every description is taken in abundance on the shore, and during the summer season it is frequently visited by fishing and pleasure parties from Dublin. To the north are the Skerries, consisting of the islets of Innispatrick, Colt, Shenex, and Red Island, the last named of which is connected to the mainland by the pier already noticed. Innispatrick is noted in the ecclesiastical annals of the country as being the place on which St Patrick first landed, and where he built a church. Between Lambay and Howth is Ireland’s Eye, or, as it should be named, Hirlandsie, a craggyrock, comprehending about thirty acres, and supposed by some geologists to be an insulated portion of the neighbouring peninsula. At the southern extremity of Dublin Bay is Dalkey Island, formerly called St Begnet’s or Bennet’s, and at present remarkable only for a martello tower erected on it. The channel which separates it from the mainland occasionally affords a good roadstead for shipping. It has been considered by some engineers as the most appropriate situation on which the public money could be laid out on a safety harbour with the greatest economy, and the most probable return of advantage to the trade of Dublin.\n",
      "The greater part of the county is the eastern extremity of the great bed of floetz limestone that extends over the middle of the island, widening as it spreads westward. It rises in its southern part into a range of mountains, which forms the verge of an elevated district, extending thence for more than thirty miles to the south. Through this latter tract a large body of granite passes in a south-western direction, bounded on its eastern and western sides by incumbent rocks of great variety of structure and relations. Within the portion of this district included in the county of Dublin, and distinguished by its beautiful scenery, are veins of lead ore at Dalkey and near the Scalp. The country near Bray presents, within a small space, an instructive series of rocks; and at Killiney, schistoze beds are to be seen to a considerable extent, reposing on granite. Near Bootcrstown, in Dublin Bay, a mass of compact limestone is visible, within a few fathoms of the granite. The calp of Kirwan, a variety of limestone, is the prevailing rock in the immediate vicinity of Dublin, and is much used for building. The brown spar of Jameson is found in veins in the quarries of Dolphinsbarn, and beds of magnesia limestone in the Dodder. Petrifactions abound in many parts of the limestone country. In the peninsula of Howth gray orc of manganese, with brown iron stone, and brown iron ore, have been obtained in quantities; and a variety of the earthy black cobalt of Werner has been found on the side of the hill, forming a crust of a rich blue colour, lining the fissures of a rock of clay slate nearly approaching to whet slate; a mineral found in great abundance at Killiney, and for some time considered as a nondescript species, is to be referred to the andalusite. It appears thickly on the surface of beds of mica slate, and seems to abound also imbedded in the substance of the same rock. White clay, potters’ clay, and yellow and brown ochre, are found in Howth, and at Rush and Skerries. Indications of lead show themselves at the commons of Kilmainham, near Castleknock, at Clontarf, and near Dalkey and Killiney. The copper mines at Lough Shinney have been badly wrought; the ore was of a rich quality, and apparently derived from contemporaneous veins of quartz of uncertain extent.\n",
      "At Lucan, tő the west of Dublin, there is a spring strongly impregnated with iron and sulphur; another exists at Goldenbridge, near Kilmainham; and both are much frequented by invalids. Chalybeate springs have been discovered in various places in the vicinity of Dublin city.\n",
      "The population of the county, taken detached from that of the city, has until lately been calculated on very uncertain data, and the results are consequently very unsatisfactory. De Burgho, in his Hibernia Dominicana, published in 1762, estimates it at 211,674, including the city; but this is evidently too high. Beaufort, in 1792, estimates it at 64,000, which is probably too low. The subsequent parliamentary returns give the following results: In 1812 it amounted to 132,000, in 1821 to 150,011, in 1831 to 183,042.\n",

As to the mode of payments, there are stated to be 730 schools, fifty-four of which, containing 3301 pupils, are supported by grants of public money; 140 schools, containing 13,467 pupils, by voluntary contributions; while those in the remaining 535 schools, amounting to 16,605 pupils, are supported wholly by the fees paid for education by the parents and friends of the children.\n",
      "Previously to the union the county returned ten representatives to parliament; two for the county, two for the city, two for the university, and two for each of the boroughs of Swords and Newcastle. The number was reduced to five by the act of union; the members for both boroughs being struck off, and one withdrawn from the university, but this latter has been restored to it by the reform act. The constituency at various periods, before, during, and since the alterations made in consequence of the Catholic relief bill, nresents the following results :—\n",

      "From this table it appears that, though the constituency has been increased by the reform act beyond what it had been reduced to by the disfranchisement of the forty-shilling freeholders, it still amounts to but one half of what it had been before that period. The county court, in which the elections are held, the county business transacted, and the records kept, is at Kilmainham, a suburb of Dublin. When opened for legal proceedings, the chairman of the county, who is a barrister, nominated by the crown, but not allowed to practise as such, presides. In many points the jurisdiction of the city police, of which an account will be given in the description of the city, extends throughout a great part of the county.\n",
      "The manners, appearance, and dress of the lower classes differ less from what may be considered as being peculiarly characteristical of the rural population of remoter districts, than might be expected in the vicinity of a large metropolis. Even in the immediate neighbourhood of the city are to be seen groups of cabins, exhibiting, both in their external appearance and in the dress and manners of their inmates, much to remind the observer of the peasantry of the interior. The farms are in general small. Near .Dublin, particularly on the southern side, they are chiefly villas, with land attached to them, more for ornament and convenience than for agricultural profit. The rents are proportionally high, being rated rather from local circumstances than from the quality of the soil. Tillage, though not in a backward state, is by no means so far advanced as might be expected. Dairy farms, for the supply of the city with milk and butter, are much run upon. Vegetable gardens are numerous, particularly in the superior soil of the northern outlets of Dublin. Grazing farms for black cattle and horses are also frequent. The fences are generally of white thorn, close, and well kept. Manure of every kind is abundant; blue, brown, and white marl is extracted in many parts; fine shelly sand is drawn from the flat shores; and coal ashes, night soil, and other refuse of the metropolis, furnish abundant supplies of this important material, varying in quality according to the taste of the farmer and the peculiarity of the soil. The waste from gas works has also been beneficially used for the same purpose, when mixed with other substances.\n",

The western, which is much the larger, is about forty miles long and twelve broad, and is bounded by Perthshire on the north; by Argyleshire, from which it is separated by an arm of the sea called Loch Long, on the west; by the river Clyde and Lanarkshire on the south-west and south; and by Stirlingshire on the east. The eastern district is completely enclosed by Stirlingshire and Lanarkshire. The whole county contains 298 square miles, or 190,848 English acres, of which the smaller division contains about forty-two miles, or 28,000 acres. It is divided into twelve parishes, of which there are only two in the eastern district, Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld. This last belonged to Stirlingshire. till the Earl of Wigton, whose property it was, became heritable sheriff of Dumbartonshire, when he procured it to be annexed to this county.\n",
      "The prevailing winds are from the west and south-west, but easterly winds are frequent in the spring months. Showers are very common, but heavy and continued rains of rare occurrence. Frosts are seldom severe, and, except on the mountains, snow never lies long. The climate is upon the whole salubrious. The range of the barometer is about 2∙80, and of the thermometer from 6° to 80°. The soils of the lower grounds are schistoze clay mixed with small stones, rich black loam on the banks of the Clyde, and gravelly soil on the river Leven; but about two thirds of the county consist of lofty mountains, some of them 3000 feet high, part of the ridge which crosses the island from Forfarshire to the Frith of Clyde, known in the districts to the eastward by the names of the Siedlaw, Ochil, and Campsie Hills.\n",
      "Coal, iron ore, limestone, freestone, and slate, are its most valuable fossil productions. There are pits for working coals at Langfauld and Lawmuir in East Kilpatrick, and at Duntocher in West Kilpatrick, where great quantities are raised for the consumption of the cotton works at Duntocher, and for calcining lime at the neighbouringlime works. Ironstone is raised in considerable quantities in the parishes of Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld, which meets with a ready market at Carron foundery.\n",
      "Limestone is found in the higher grounds at Kilpatrick, Dumbarton, and Row; but it is only wrought at Langfauld, Lawmuir, and Duntocher, where coal is quarried along with it, and also at Row, Netherwood, and Cumbernauld. White and red freestone are met with in several places; the finest quarries are at Garscube, on the banke of the Forth and Clyde Canal; and at Levengrove and Dalreoch, in the immediate neighbourhood of Dumbarton.\n",
      "Several slate quarries have been wrought with success, at Luss and Camstradden on the estates of Sir James Colquhoun, and at Roseneath on the estates of the Duke of Argyll. The principal markets are at Glasgow, Greenock, &c. to which the slates are conveyed in lighters by the Leven and the Clyde.\n",
      "The only river of any note which can be said to belong to this county is the Leven, the outlet of Lochlomond, which, flowing for about five miles through a fine valley, joins the Clyde at Dumbarton Castle. Its waters, which are singularly pure and soft, are well adapted to the business of bleaching and printing cottons, branches which are established to a great extent along its course. The other streams are Luss, Froon, Finlays, Douglas, Falloch, and Luggie. Clyde, Endrick, and Kelvin, flow along its borders. Lochlong and Gareloch are arms of the sea, the first of which separates this county from Argyleshire; and the other, penetrating the land for about seven miles, nearly detaches the peninsula of Roseneath from the mainland. W’hilst this extent of sea-coast affords the benefit of water carriage to so large a portion of the county, the inland tracts are benefited in almost an equal degree by the Forth and Clyde Canal, which passes through it for more than sixteen miles. This canal is about thirty-five miles in length, and it rises and falls about 160 feet, by means of forty locks. It is carried over the valley where the Kelvin flows, by an aqueduct sixty-five feet in height and 420 feet in length. The only remarkable lake is Lochlomond, which is about twenty-four miles long, and in its greatest breadth, towards the south, above six. About two thirds of the shore, and most of its islands, thirty in all, are in Dumbartonshire; the rest belong to Stirlingshire. It is probably not to be equalled by any lake in Britain for the variety and magnificence of its scenery; the picturesque beauty of its wooded banks and islands affording a striking contrast to the rugged and lofty nιoun-tains that rise in its vicinity. It covers about 20,000 acres, and its surface is supposed to be increasing. The best view of the lake is from a promontory above Luss, a village on the western shore.\n",
      "The landed property of this county is divided among about a hundred and fifty individuals, exclusive of feuars in towns and villages. One third of the estates are of considerable extent, and the remainder are small. The valued rent is L.33,327. 19s. Scots, of which about a third is held under the fetters of strict entails. In 1811 the actual rent of the lands was L.56,972. 15s., and of the houses L.5791. l5s., total L.62,764. 10s.; and the annual value of real property in 1815 λvas L.71,587 sterling. There are a number of beautiful seats belonging to the larger proprietors, among which Roseneath, the splendid mansion of the Duke of Argyll, and Garscubc, the residence of Sir Archibald Campbell of Succoth, are by far the finest specimens of architecture. There are also a great many fine villas, the property of manufacturers and merchants.\n",
      "The county sends one member to parliament, who, prior to the passing of the reform act in 1832, was elected by about seventy voters upon superiorities; but by the reform measure the constituency has been increased to 924.\n",
      "The arable lands of Dumbartonshire are divided into farms ranging in extent from 50 to 250 acres: and of late years great improvements have been made in agriculture, and in the breed of all kinds of stock. The land is generally laboured and manured according to the improved system of husbandry; two crops of grain seldom or never being taken without the intervention of a green crop properly tilled and manured. The usual rotation is, first, oats; secondly, potatoes or other green crop; thirdly, wheat or barley sown with rye-grass and clover; fourthly, hay; and, lastly, pasture. Wheat, oats, and potatoes, are the principal crops. The land is well inclosed and subdivided, principally by hedge and ditch, and partially by stone-walls. The tenants generally hold leases for nineteen years. Within the last twelve or fifteen years the breed of draught or farm horses has been greatly improved; a circumstance which is ascribed partly to the emulation excited among the tenantry to ride good horses at the yeomanry drills, and partly to the annual competition for prizes given by the landlords of this district. The dairy stock is principally of the Ayrshire breed; and great improvements have also been made in this department, which is a source of much profit to the farmers nearest to the city of Glasgow. The accommodation to the tenantry has kept pace with these improvements. Many excellent steadings have been erected, generally in the form of a square, having in front the dwelling-house, which communicates with the offices, forming the other three sides of a square.\n",
      "There arc in this county many excellent tracts of pasture land. Sheep of the black-faced breed, and a limited number of black cattle, are reared with great success. The shccp are disposed of in Glasgow, where there is a weekly sale; and the cattle are sold at the Carman market, held in the Moor of Carman on the first Tuesday of June. From 12,000 to 17,000 head of cattle, principally of the Argylcshire breed, arc generally disposed of at that market, for the purpose of being fattened on the rich pastures of the south. In the highland district, farms for grazing arc necessarily of great extent. But it is not uncommon for fishermen and mechanics to hold pendicles, or “poffles” as they arc called, below L.12 of rent; and the cottars, who are usually employed as labourers on the larger farms, possess small patches of arable ground for raising potatoes, with hill pasture for a cow, at a rent of L.5, and sometimes less.\n",
      "Great improvements have been made on the roads intersecting this county. A new road along the upper part of Lochlomond, and passing through Glenfalloch, communicates with the great military road through Perthshire, Argyleshire, &c. and renders all parts of this county of easy access.\n",
      "The woods and plantations of this county are extensive and valuable. According to the agricultural survey in 1810, their extent appears to be near 7000 English acres, of which about the half is coppice; yielding to the proprietors a yearly income almost equal to the rent of the arable lands. On spots unfavourable to oak, these coppice woods consist of ash, yew, holly, mountain-ash, birch, hazel, aspen, alder, crab, thorn, and willow. The age at which they are cut is from twenty-two to twenty-four years, when they are worth from L.40 to L.45 an acre; but there are instances of woods, of considerable extent, selling at much more, where proper attention has been paid to inclosing them, and afterwards thickening them by means of layers, or thinning them, as may be necessary. It is the usual practice to reserve a certain number of young trees at each cutting, the greater part of which are cut down at the second fall, when they are nearly fifty years old, and the rest left to grow up to timber trees. The soil and climate of this county are particularly favourable to plantations, which begin to make\n",

      "one of the counties of England. Before the arrival of the Romans it was included in the British principality of the Brigantcs, and after their arrival made part of the province of Maxima Coesariensis. During the heptarchy it formed part of the kingdom of Northumberland, the fifth established, which began in 547, and ended in 827, having been governed by thirty-one kings. It was not mentioned by Alfred in his division of counties, being at that time considered as a part of Yorkshire. At present it is included in the northern circuit, in the province of York, and is a diocese and principality under the government of its own bishop, being a county palatine, the second in rank, and the richest in England, lt is bounded on the north by Northumberland, on the south by Yorkshire, on the east by the North Sea, and on the west by Cumberland. It extends, according to the view of Mr Rickman, over 1061 square miles, and contains one city of the same name, nine market-towns, and 223 villages. It is divided into four wards. Until the passing of the reform act, it returned two members to the House of Commons for the county, and two for the city. The county has been formed, by that law, into tw o divisions, for the purpose of parliamentary elections; each of which returns two members. The northern division comprehends the wards of Chester and Easington, and the polling places are Durham, Sunderland, Lancheton, W τ ickham, Chester-le-Street, and South Shields. The southern division comprehends the wards of Darlington and Stockton, and thepoling placcsare these two towns, and Bishop Auckland, Stanhope, Middleton-in-Teesdale, Barnard Castle, and Sedgefield. The following places within the county have by the same law obtained the privilege of electing two members each, viz. Gateshead, South Shields, Sunderland, and Tynemouth.\n",
      "This is the only county palatine remaining in England, and it is called palatine, a palatio, because the owners thereof had, in this county, the authority to use the royal prerogative, as fully as the king had in his palace. The palatine privileges were granted to this county probably on account of its bordering upon the inimical kingdom of Scotland, in order that the inhabitants, having justice administered at home, might not be obliged to go out of their county, and leave it open to an enemy’s incursions; and that the owners, being encouraged by so large an authority, might be the more watchful in its defence. There is a court of chancery in this county, and the bishop is at the head of the administration of justice.\n",
      "The western angle of the county of Durham is hilly and mountainous, with black, naked, and barren regions, crossed by a ridge of high hills, from whose sides issue numerous streams flowing to the sea. There are some beautiful and fertile valleys in the eastern and central parts, pleasantly varied with hill and dale, and alternately appropriated to corn and pasture. The waste lands occupy nearly 120,000 acres of the western part of the county; but in the southern districts many hundred acres have been inclosed and cultivated within the last forty years. The common fields are now but few; for the land belonging to the townships has been inclosed for above a century. There is a great portion of wet ground still remaining, although draining is carried on to a great extent.\n",
      "Near the river Tees, and in some spots bordering on the other rivers, the soil is loam or a rich clay. At a farther distance from these rivers the soil is of an inferior quality, and marshy, with patches of gravel interspersed. The hills between the sea and an imaginary line from Barnard Castle on the Tees to Alansford on the Derwent, are covered with a dry4oam, the fertility of which varies with its depth. From this line westward the summits as well as the sides of the hills are moorish wastes.\n",
      "The woodlands of Durham are not of very considerable extent, trees being chiefly confined to the parks and seats of the nobility and gentry, but many plantations have been made of late years. The banks of the rivers and brooks, however, particularly in the vicinity of Durham, are fringed with wood of long growth and much value. The public roads are in general good, but those belonging to private districts and townships want improving.\n",
      "The port of Stockton-upon-Tees is well situated for commerce. Hartlepool, situated on a promontory, nearly encompassed by the German Ocean, which on the south . side of the town forms a capacious bay, is advantageously placed for the reception of vessels, and landing of troops from the Continent; and South Shields sends out many ships.\n",
      "The mineralogical substances found in Durham are numerous and valuable. The coal mines are some of the most extensive and productive in the kingdom, and the quantity of this important article is so great as to exceed all calculation. At Sunderland the coal trade furnishes employment for 520 vessels, independently of the heels which convey the coal from the staiths to the ships, which ąre 492 in number. This coal is chiefly conveyed to the metropolis, though great quantities are sent to the different ports of the Baltic, and in time of peace to France and Holland. The whole quantity annually exported from Sunderland alone amounts to about 315,000 Newcastle chaldrons, each chaldron being equal to 53 cwt. The number of persons dependent on this trade is very great, and some years ago, when the consumption was by no means so great as it is at present, amounted to upwards of 26,000 on the river Wear only. The seams or strata now worked are five in number, extending horizontally for many miles, and are from twenty to one hundred fathoms beneath the surface; while each stratum is from three to eight feet thick. Below these are several other seams of coal; and many parts of the county, besides those where the pits are now open, abound with this substance.\n",
      "The principal lead mines of Durham are situated in Teesdale and Weardale; those of the former place have not been very productive, but the produce of the latter is of considerable value. The general method of working them is similar to that pursued in other mining counties. The ore of Weardale is melted by the blast-hearth, but in Teesdale air-furnaces have been introduced with much success.\n",
      "Ironstone is found in the neighbourhood of Swalwell and Winlaton, where are the first iron-works in England.\n",
      "Some excellent quarries of slate for buildings have been opened in different parts of the county. A beautiful black spotted limestone is dug up near Walsingham, and made into hearths, chimney-pieces, and other ornaments. This neighbourhood abounds also with fine millstones. The Newcastle grindstones are procured at Gateshead Fell; and firestone of high estimation, for building ovens, furnaces, and the like, is obtained in various parts of Durham, and exported in immense quantities.\n",
      "Several extensive works for manufacturing salt from sea-water have long been established in the neighbourhood of South Shields; but owing to the discovery of a very singular salt spring at Birtley in this county, that process is not so much attended to now. This water rises at the depth of seventy fathoms, in an engine pit constructed for drawing water out of coal mines. It has for many years produced 20,000 gallons per day, four times more strongly impregnated with salt than any sea-water. In consequence of the discovery of this spring, about twenty-five years ago, a large and extensive manufactory of salt has been established near the spot, the quality of which is excellent. At Butterby, near Durham, is another salt spring, which issues from a rock in the river Wear, but is only visible when the water is low; it contains more of the sulphate of magnesia, or Epsom salt, than the spring at Birtley. Within a few yards of the Water-gate, on the south side of the town of Hartlepool, is a chalybeate spring, covered every tide by the sea. It is impregnated slightly with sulphur, which evaporates very quickly, leaving a sediment with salt of tartar; a gallon will yield 120 grains of sediment, two parts of which are nitrous, and the rest limestone.\n",
      "Improvements in agriculture have been pursued with considerable spirit and success, in the environs of Darlington, chiefly through the patronage of a society of respectable gentlemen, who hold their meetings in the town, and bestow premiums upon merit. The usual rotation of crops in this county is, after summer fallow, wheat, oats, beans, or peas. On some spots of gravelly soil, turnips and barley are grown in almost perpetual succession, a crop ofclover being sometimes interposed. The produce of wheat on good land is from twenty to thirty bushels per acre, the produce of barley is from thirty to forty, of oats from twenty to forty. The manures are chiefly lime and the produce of the fold-yard; and though abundance, of sea-weed might be collected on the coast, the farmers make but little use of it. The farms are of a middling size, few of them exceeding 200 acres. The largest portion of each farm is appropriated to tillage, but towards the western extremity of the county the whole is applied to pasture. The leases seldom exceed six years, and are too frequently rendered of little value by injudicious restrictions. The leases held of the see of Durham are generally for life, or for twenty one years, renewable every seven years on payment of a fine. The farm-houses are well situated and commodious, and improvements in farming and farming machinery become more and more common.\n",
      "The cattle at Durham are, at present, in great repute; as, for form, weight, produce of milk, and quickness of fattening, there are none better. The sheep also, particularly the Tees Water breed, stand high in estimation. It is the largest breed in the island; the legs being longer, finer boned, and supporting a thicker and more firm and heavy carcass, than the Lincolnshire. They are also much wider on the backs and sides, and afford a fatter and finer \n",

      "the most eminent of the geographers who have written in the Arabic language. There is no individual of equal eminence over whose life there hangs a deeper veil of mystery, the various parts of it affording rather subjects of controversy to the learned than of precise information to the biographer. The place, and even the country in which he was born, compose the first subject of disputation. Sionita and Hezronita, who published a Latin translation of his work at Paris, make him a Nubian, and gave to their work the title of Geographia Nubiensis, the Nubian Geography. They proceeded upon the expression there used, namely, “the Nile of Egypt, which cuts our land” Hartmann was at once led to suspect the correctness of this inference, by observing that Nubia was one of the countries of which Edriβi gives the most meagre and imperfect account; and his suspicions were confirmed by learning that Ockley, on examining two manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, had found in both “that land,\" instead of “our land.” It seems now generally agreed, therefore, that there is no reason to suppose him of Nubian origin. Others have given him an Egyptian one, which seems more probable, yet rests solely upon the erroneous reading above referred to. In 1663, Bochart stated that he had found in a manuscript of Leo Africanus, that Edrisi was born at Mazara, in Sicily, in 1098. Next year, however, the manuscript was edited by Hot-tinger, in an appendix to his work entitled Bdιliothecarius Quadripartibus, when it appeared that the person supposed to be Edrisi was there named Esseriff Ľssachalli. Esseriff, or Scheriff, is indeed an usual appellation of Edrisi, but it is common to many, and is rather a title than a name. The rest of the name, and the date of birth, are materially different, so that there seems very little reason to doubt that Bochart was here mistaken.\n",
      "The most positive statement on the subject is that of Casiri, who says (Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispanice, ii. 9), that if Edrisi, as appeared probable, were the person designated by the Mahommedan writers under the long appellation of Abu Abdallah Mohamad Ben Mohamad Ben Abdallah Ben Edris, he was born at Septa, or Ceuta, on Lite coast of Morocco, in the year of the Hegira 493 (a. d. 1099). Casiri not only qualifies his statement with this condition, but he does not state the authorities from which it is derived; so that it rests only upon the confidence reposed in his learning and accuracy. Edrisi was long a mighty name in Northern Africa; but in 919 the dynasty was subverted by Mahedi Abdallah, and the proscribed wrecks of the family, according to D’Herbelot, afterwards sought refuge in Sicily. This certainly tends to strengthen the Sicilian origin of our author, though it is not probable that many would seek refuge by concealment in their native country.\n",
      "If we may trust the information of Casiri, Edrisi pursued his studies at Cordova, then equally famed as a seat of Moorish empire and a seminary of Arabic learning. From the accurate and particular description he has given of Spain, it is probable that he had travelled through a great part of that country. Various circumstances prove that he removed to Sicily, and began to compose his great work under the patronage, and indeed at the express desire, of Roger IL king of that island. It was completed about the year of the Hegira 548, a. d. 1153.\n",
      "It has been a subject of pretty warm controversy among the learned whether Edrisi was a Mahommedan or a Christian. Sionita, who adopts the latter opinion, observes that he repeatedly calls our Saviour the Lord Jesus, and on one occasion simply the Lord, a title which is said never to be applied by Mahommedans unless to Mahommed, while they merely say “Jesus, to whom be peace,” or “Jesus, to whom be safety.” He also speaks with profound respect of the holy Virgin, and of various saints, using in regard to the latter the Italian expression instead of the Arabic. These arguments are strenuously repelled by Hartmann, though not, as appears to us, on very solid grounds. He justly remarks, indeed, that the Mahommedans speak always with the highest respect of every thing connected with the origin of Christianity. But though this may impair the force of Sionita's arguments, there seems nothing of any importance to place in the opposite scale. Hartmann lays much stress on the circumstance that Edrisi, amongst his numerous names, bears that of Mohamad, which he says was never borne by any Christian; but though this may imply that he was a Mahommedan by birth, it does not authorize us to infer that he may not have become a convert to the opposite faith. He evidently wishes to offend persons of neither profession, and thus writes in a style from which no positive inference can be drawn. But considering how high religious differences ran in that age, it does not appear very probable that he could have resided in Sicily, or been in such high favour with Roger, without adopting the religion of the monarch and country.\n",
      "Tlιe only thing relative to the life of this eminent author which remains even a subject of controversy, is the period of its termination. Bochart has fixed it in the year 1122; but this date clearly proves that he had some quite different person in view; since it appears by the preface to Edrisi’s own work, that its completion took place in the year 1153. No other notice, nor even conjecture, relative to the time or manner of his death, is to be found in any author.\n",
      "From these meagre notices respecting the life of Edrisi, we shall proceed to give some account of his work. It has appeared under various titles. The first and fullest appears to have been, The going out of a Curious Man to explore the Regions of the Globe, its Provinces, Islands, Cities, and their Dimensions and Situation. This is sometimes abbreviated into The going out of a Curious Man to explore the Regions of the Globe ; and sometimes merely The going out of a Curious Man. Sionita published it under the name of Relaxation of the Curious Mind ; but the title of Nubian Geography, which he and his companion imposed upon it, though it has become general in Europe, is, as already observed, altogether arbitrary.\n",
      "The work contains a full description of the whole world, as far as it was known to the author, with its countries, cities, and all its features, physical and political. These are arranged, not according to any of the methods to which we are accustomed, but in a manner peculiar to itself. The world is divided into seven climates, commencing at the equinoctial line, and extending northwards to the limit at which the earth is supposed to be rendered uninhabitable by cold. Each climate is then divided by perpendicular lines into eleven equal parts, beginning with the western coast of Africa, and ending with the eastern coast of Asia. The whole world is thus formed into seventyseven equal square compartments, resembling those upon a chess-board, or those formed upon a plane map, by the intersecting lines of latitude and longitude. The geographer begins with the first part of the first climate, including the western part of Central Africa, and proceeds eastward through the different divisions of this climate, till he finds its termination in the Sea of China. He then returns to the first part of the second climate, and so proceeds till he reaches the eleventh part of the seventh climate, which terminates in the north-eastern extremity of Asia. The inconveniences of such an arrangement must be abundantly obvious. Instead of each country, or at least each region of similar physical character, being described by itself, it is severed by these mechanical sections into fragments, which are described in different and distant parts of the work; and no connected view is given of any great country.\n",
      "The only valuable unpublished manuscripts of Edrisi which now exist in Europe are two which are preserved in the Bodleian Library. The first, which was brought over from Egypt by Greaves, is written in the Arabic character peculiar to Northern Africa. It is illustrated by a map of the known world, and by thirty-three other maps, containing each part of a climate, so that there are maps only for the first three climates. The second manuscript, brought by Pococke from Syria, is written in the Arabic character, as used in that country, and bears the date of 906 of the Hegira, or a. d. 1500. It consists of 320 leaves, and is illustrated by one general and seventy-seven particular maps, the last consequently including all the parts of every climate. The general map has been published by Dr Vincent in his Periplus of the Erythrcean Sea.\n",
      "There is a manuscript (Cod. DLXXX) in the Royal Library at Paris, which professes to be the production of Edrisi; but D’Herbelot, it appears, has not made use of it as such; and De Guignes expresses positive disbelief on the subject. Hartmann, however, found it to coincide in many particulars with the geography of Edrisi. A copy of our author's work was contained at one time in the library of the Escurial, but it was destroyed by a great fire in the year 1671.\n",
      "The geography of Edrisi, in the original Arabic, was printed at Rome in 1592, at the Medicean press, from a manuscript preserved in the grand-ducal library at Florence. Both the paper and printing are exceedingly neat, the latter being made to resemble manuscript. This unfortunately constitutes the whole merit of the edition, which swarms with typographical errors, and forms, besides, only an epitome of the original work. This epitome seems made, indeed, in the oriental style, by the simple omission of those parts which appeared to the editor to be superfluous; but these comprise many essential and important passages. The description of Mecca, for example, which had been unaccountably omitted, is supplied by Pococke from his manuscript. Hartmann gives instances where reference is made to the description of places of which there occurs no other mention. D’H\n",

      "in Grecian antiquity, a festival observed in honour of Ceres, by some states every fourth, hut by others every fifth year. The Athenians celebrated it at Eleusis, a town of Attiea; and hence arose the name.\n",
      "Ceres, saysIsoerates, wandering in quest ofher daughter Proserpine, arrived in Attiea, where some good officeswere rendered her, whieh it is unlawful for those who are not initiated to hear. In return she conferred two unparalleled benefits, namely, the knowledge of agriculture, by whieh the human race is raised above the brute creation; and the mysteries, from whieh the partakers derive sweeter hopes than other men enjoy, both as to the present life and a future state of existence. It was the popular opinion that the Ľleusinian goddesses suggested prudent counsel to their votaries, and influeneed their conduct; and that the latter were respected in the infernal regions, and had precedence in the assemblies of the blessed, whilst the unhallowed were left in utter darkness, wallowing in mire, or labouring to fill a leaky vessel. The Athenians were solicitous to secure these advantages to their children, by having them initiated as soon as possible in the Eleusinian mysteries.\n",
      "Ceres was supposed to be particularly partial to Eleusis and its vicinity. There were the memorials ofher presence and ofher bounty; the well named Callichorus, by which she had rested, in the reign of Ereetheus; the stone on whieh she sat, named the sorrowful ; the Rharian plain, where barley was first sown; and the thrashing floor and altar of Triptolemus, a herdsman whom she instructed in the culture of that grain, the use of which succeeded to aeorns. Her mysteries continued to possess a pre-cmi-nenec in holiness, and to be accounted as much superior to all other religious festivals as the gods were to the deified heroes. Even the garments worn at the solemnity were supposed to partake ôf the efficaey of the mysteries, and to be possessed of signal virtues. It was customary to retain them until they began to deeay, and then to dedicate them in the temple, or to use them as swaddling elothes.\n",
      "The mystic temple, as it was called, provided by Pericles for the solemnity, created by its sanetity an awe only equalled by the astonishment which its beauty and magnitude exeited in every beholder. The profane or uninitiated were forbidden to enter it upon any pretenee. Two young AEarnanians happening inadvertently to mix with the erowd at the season of the mysteries, and to go in, were discovered and put to death. The chief priest, hierophant, or mystagogue, was taken from the Eumolpidae, a holy family which flourished at Athens, and derived its descent from Eumolpus, a shepherd and favourite of Ceres. He was enjoined to observe celibacy, and he wore a stole or long garment, and in his hair a wreath of myrtle. The grand requisites in his character were strength and melody of voiee, solemnity of deportment, magnificence, and strict decorum. Under him, besides many of inferior station, was the daduchus or toreh-bearer, who likewise wore his hair with a fillet; the priest, who officiated at the altar; and the hiero-eeryx, or saered herald; all very important personages. The latter was of a family which claimed the god Mercury, and Aglauros, the ∣ daughter of Cecrops, for its ancestors.\n",
      "The secrecy in which the mysteries were enveloped 1 served to enhance the idea of their consequence, and to increase the dcsire of participation. It was so strict that ∣ no person was allowed even to name the hierophant by whom he had been initiated; whilst public abhorrence and detestation awaited the babbler, and the law decreed that he should die the death.\n",
      "The Athenians suffered none to be initiated into these mystcrics excepting such as were members of their city. This regulation, which compelled Hercules, Castor, and Pollux, to become citizens of Athens, was strictly observed in the first ages of the institution; but after a time all persons, barbarians excepted, were freely admitted.\n",
      "The festivals were divided into greater and lesser mysteries. The institution of the latter arose out of the following circumstance. Hercules having passed near Eleusis while the Athenians were celebrating the mysteries, desired to be initiated. As this request could not be complied with, he being a stranger, and as Eumolpus was unwilling to displease him on account of his great power, and the services which he had rendered to the Athenians, another festival was instituted without violating the laws; it was dcnominated μmοa, and Hercules was solemnly admitted to the celebration, and initiated. These lesser mysteries were observed at Agrae, near the Ilissus. The greater were celebrated at Eleusis, from which place Ceres has been called Eleusinia. In later times the lesser festivals were preparatory to the greater, and no person could be initiated at Eleusis without a previous purification at z∖grae. This purification they performed by keeping themselves pure, chaste, and unpolluted during nine days; after which they came and offered sacrifices and prayers, wearing garlands of flowers called iμt^α, and having under their feet Δ/o¢ κωδ/ον, Jupiter's shin, which was the skin of a victim offered to that god. The person who assisted was called υδgavoς, from υδωg, water, which was used at the purification; and those purified were called μυδτaι, the initiated. A year after the initiation into the lesser mysteries they sacrificed a sow to Ceres, and Λvere admitted into the greater, and the secrets of the festivals were solemnly revealed to them.\n",
      "This festival was observed in the month Boedromĩon or September, and continued nine days, from the 15th till the 23d. During that time it was unlawful to arrest any man, or present any petition, on pain of forfeiting a thousand drachmas, or, according to others, on pain of death. It was also unlawful for those who were initiated to sit upon the cover of a well, and to eat beans, mullets, or weazels. If any woman rode to Elcusis in a chariot she was obliged by an edict of Lycurgus to pay six thousand drachmas. The design of this law was to destroy all distinction between the richer and poorer citizens. When the season approached, the mystae, or persons who had been initiated only in the lesser mysteries, repaired to Eleusis to be instructed in the ceremonial. The service for the opening of the temple, with morning sacrifice, was performed, and the ritual was then produced from the sanctuary. It was enveloped in symbolical figures of animals, which suggested words compendiously, in letters with ligatures, the tops being buddled together, or disposed circularly like a wheel, and the whole utterly inexplicable to the profane. The case, which was called pe-troma, consisted of two stones exactly fitted; and the mysterious record, after being read, was closed up and replaced until a future festival. The principal rite was nocturnal, and confined to the temple and its environs. The mystae waited without with impatience and apprehension. Lamentations and strange sounds were heard. Thunder pealed above these noises, and flashes of light and fire irradiated the gloom, rendering the darkness which followed more awful and sublime. The candidates for initiation were beaten by some invisible hand, whilst frightful apparitions, and monsters of a canine form, were presented to them, which filled them with apprehension and terror, and paralysed their energies. The scene then suddenly changed to one of a brilliant and agreeable character. The propylaea or vestibules of the temple were opened, the curtains withdrawn, and the hidden things displayed. They were introduced by the hierophant and daduchus, the former of whom revealed to them the mysteries. The splendour of illumination, the glory of the temple and of the images, and the singing and dancing which accompanied the exhibition, all contributed to soothe the mind after its recent agitation, and to render the wondering devotee tranquil and satisfied. After this inspection, or. as it was called, the autopsia, they retired, and others advanced. The succeeding days were employed in purification, in sacrifice, in pompous processions, and in spectacles, at which they assisted, wearing myrtle crowns. The second day was called αλαδs μυδτaι, to the sea, ye initiated ; because they were commanded to purify themselves by ablution in the sea. On the third.day sacrifices were offered, as also a mullet, and barley from a field of Eleusis. These oblations were called Šua, and were held so sacred that the priests themselves dared not, as in other sacrifices, partake of them. On the fourth day they made a solemn procession, in which the zαλαMov, or holy basket of Ceres, was paraded in a consecrated cart, while on every ţside the people shouted ∆ij∕zηrεi, Hail, Ceres. After these followed women, called xιδτο<ροξοι, who carried baskets, in which was sesamin, carded wool, grains of salt, a serpent, pomegranates, reeds, ivy boughs, and so on. The fifth was called ⅛ τωv λαμπάδων r ∣ μεξα, the torch day, because on the following night the people ran about with torches in their hands. It was usual to dedicate torches to Ceres, and contend who should offer the largest, in commemoration of the travels of the goddess, and of her lighting a torch in the flames of Mount AEtna. The sixth day was called Ιακχος, from Iacchus, the son of Jupiter and Cercs, who accompanied his mother in her search after Proserpine, with a torch in his hand. From this circumstance the hand of his statue was furnished with a torch, and carried in solemn procession from the Ccramicus to Eleusis. The statue, with those who accompanied it, called Iα%χα- γωγov, was crowned with myrtle. In the way nothing was heard but singing and the noise of brazen kettles as the votaries danced along. The way through which they issued from the city was called iιeα oδoς, or the sacred ιvay the resting place ∕sgα δ ∖ rxr i , from a jig-tree which grew ir the neighbourhood. They al\n",

      "the southern, and by far the most fertile division of Britain, corresponds in latitude with Holland and the north of Germany, extending from 50° to 55° 45' N. Its figure is nearly triangular, and its extent of coast is very great, both from being much indented, and from the sea bounding it on all sides except along a width of seventy miles on the Scottish border. The adjacent seas are the German Ocean on the east, St George’s Channel on the west, and the English Channel on the south. No country can be more fortunately situated; its climate is temperate; its extent is sufficient for its political security; whilst its insular position not only presents the greatest capabilities of aggrandisement in a commercial sense, but has, by rendering a great military force unnecessary, in all probability been the chief cause of preventing the executive branch from usurping absolute power, as in the countries of the Continent,\n",
      "Its superficial extent had long been a question of considerable doubt, and the different estimates varied no less than ten millions of acres. Mr Pitt, on the authority of Arthur Young, assumed, in 1798, the superficial extent of England and Wales to be nearly 47,000,000 of acres; a later calculation by Dr Beeke, approaching more to accuracy than any. preceding one, fixed it at 38,500,000 acres;^[20. Observations on the Produce of the Income Tax, &c. 1800. ] but, according to Arrowsmith’s map, which, as it is principally founded on the trigonometrical survey, cannot involve any material error, the area of England and Wales amounts to 57,960 square miles of 69∙15 to the degree, or to 37,094,400 imperial acres. This is the measure that is now adopted in all the parliamentary reports.\n",
      "England is, in general, a level country. In the north, F Westmoreland, and a considerable part of Cumberland, c< Lancashire, and Yorkshire, are mountainous; but most of the other counties present a succession rather of picturesque eminences than of great elevations, forming a striking contrast to the barren ridges of the northern part of the island, and still more to the abrupt and awful scenery of Switzerland or the south of Germany. The highest mountains of England are in the north-west, where there are several exceeding 3000 feet in height; of these, the most noted, if not the highest, is Skiddaw. Between Lancashire and Yorkshire there is a range of nearly equal altitude; in Shropshire there are various hills; also in Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, none of which, however, reaches the height of2000 feet. There is a long hilly range which traverses the southern counties, in a line nearly due east and west from Dorsetshire to Kent; and another that stretches in a north-east direction fromWiltshire to the East Riding of Yorkshire; but both are of inconsiderable elevation. The traveller who proceeds northward from London to York meets very few hills, and hardly one mountain, in a distance of 200 miles. To the east of this road, the country, particularly Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, and part of the East Riding of Yorkshire, is almost entirely level, and bears a great resemblance to Holland; consisting of fęns apparently gained in a very remote age from the sea. In Wales the face of the country is altogether different, being mountainous throughout, and some of the hills, in particular Snowdon and Cader Idris, attaining a height nearly 3600 feet above the level of the sea.\n",
      "The sea-coast of England presents a very different aspect in different situations; in some quarters, as in Cornwall, Kent, part of Norfolk, and Wales, it is steep and elevated; in other parts it is low, sandy, or marshy; exhibiting, on the whole, a variety which hardly admits of being brought under a uniform description, and which, though partaking much more of a level than rugged character, still differs greatly from the opposite shore of Flanders, Holland, and Friesland, which is one continued flat for more than 300 miles.\n",
      "Of the rivers of England, the largest are the Thames, the Severn, and the Trent. The Thames has no pretensions to romantic effect in any part of its course, nor is its body of fresh water large; but it is navigable for more than 120 miles, and, in the approach to London from the Ncre, presents to the admiring spectator a prospect which, whether we consider the quantity of shipping, the thickening population, or the high state of improvement of its banks, is wholly without parallel. The Severn, though not equal to the Tay in quantity of fresh water, is superior to the Thames, and during the first part of its course preserves the characteristics of a mountain stream, being clear, and at times bordered by picturesque scenery; but on leaving W τ ales, and entering a more level country, it assumes a different aspect, and becomes a full slow-flowing river, admitting of easy navigation, and facilitating greatly the commerce of Shropshire, Worcestershire, and Gloucestershire. Towards its mouth it receives the Wye, a large navigable river from Wales. The Trent rises in Staffordshire, and after a course, often tortuous, but generally in a north-east direction, falls into the Humber, which soon after becomes a broad estuary. The Mersey, as a river, is of no great importance, but as an arm of the sea it affords, from the west, a very capacious inlet to the trade of Liverpool, and facilitates the conveyance of the produce of the interior. The Tyne is a large stream, having Newcastle on its banks, and Shields near its mouth. The Medway, as a fresh-water river, is small and sluggish, but acquires, by the influx of the tide, such a depth of water at Chatham as to adapt it to the reception of the largest men of war. Speaking generally, it is only the rivers of Wales, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and a few mountainous districts, that are rapid or transparent; the great majority of English rivers, particularly in the eastern and central part of the kingdom, are slow in their course, and owe the degree of beauty which they possess, less to the effect of the water or scenery, than to the high cultivation and elegant disposition of the adjacent grounds.\n",
      "A similar remark applies to the lakes of England. Nothing can exceed the beauty of Winandermere, Keswick, and Ulleswater; whilst the unvaried and uninteresting collections of water, such as Whittleseameer, and others in the fen district, are to be compared only to those in North Holland or Friesland. In regard to wood, England is very well provided, without having many of those extensive forests which are met with on the Continent upon great mountain ranges, such as on the Jura ridge between France and Switzerland, and the Suabian Alps upon the Upper Rhine. It is in private plantations of limited extent, but of very frequent occurrence, and sometimes oř great beauty, that the chief stock of English timber is to be found. Several very extensive tracts, such as the New Forest in Hampshire, the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, and Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, belong to the crown.\n",
      "The soil of England is suited to a great variety of products; but it has not the exuberant fertility of southern climates, much labour and vigilance being requisite tc obtain from it a grateful return. The quantity of moisture makes it admirably adapted for pasture; a characteristic which does not particularly strike those whose travels have never extended beyond their own country, but is of the highest importance in the view of those who have visited the Continent, and have witnessed the parched and arid state of the richest plains in the months of autumn. In regard to husbandry, it happens, by a singular coincidence, that in England, as in Scotland, the best is practised in the east part of the island, particularly in Norfolk and Northumberland. As to mineral treasures, the eastern counties of England, to the south of Yorkshire, are remarkable for containing no mines either of coal or of metal: these valuable deposits are to be sought in the more uneven districts of the north and west, viz. in Northumberland, Durham, Westmoreland, Lancashire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Devon, and Cornwall, in Wales, and in the midland counties of Warwick, Stafford, and Derby. In the east, particularly in Lincoln and Cambridgeshire, vast improvements have been made in the present age by draining; but there are still the means of making further and valuable acquisitions. Much also remains to be done in bringing into culture extensive heaths and moorlands in almost every county in the kingdom. The soil of these is in general poor, but the tillage required would seldom be obstructed, as in many parts of Scotland, by the ruggedness of the surface. Comparing the soil of England with that of the adjacent countries, we find it greatly superior to that of Scotland, except along our eastern coast; it is perhaps better also than that of Ireland, fertile as the latter naturally is; nor needs it, on the whole, dread a comparison even with the soil of France, where, amidst districts of great beauty and luxuriance, the eye of the traveller is often struck with extensive tracts of heath or marsh.\n",

It also gives an estimate, 1+ of the extent of the arable, meadow, and pasture land in each county; 2rfZy, of the waste land in each capable of being converted into arable, meadow, and pasture; and, ⅛dly, of the extent of surface in each susceptible of cultivation, or of conversion into meadow or pasture, consisting of unimprovable mountain and moor, lakes, rivers, roads, canals, woods, fences, &c.\n",

      "This tract of country extends along the western coast of India, from Cape Comorin to the river Chandragiri, in lat. 12. 30. north. The British province of Malabar is a particular portion of this tract, which is situated between the 10th and 13th degrees of north latitude. Io the north it is bounded by the province of Canara, to the south by the rajah of Cochin’s territories, to the west by the ocean, and to the east by the chain of the Western Ghauts, below which the country lies, extending about 200 miles along the sea-coast. The country may be divided into two portions, the first of which borders the seacoast, and consists of a poor sandy soil, seldom above three miles wide, and in general not so much. Low branches of hills extend from the Ghauts to a considerable distance’ to the westward, and sometimes even to the sea. The strip of country bordering upon the sea is well adapted for the cultivation of rice; and it is remarkably intersected by inlets of the sea, which often run for great lengths parallel to the line of coast, receiving the various mountainstreams, and communicating with the ocean by different narrow and shallow openings. In other places, the fresh water, as it descends from the mountains into the low lands within the downs upon the sea-coast, in the rainy season, totally overflows them, as the water has no issue, and must consequently stagnate until it evaporates. By this natural irrigation the lands are fitted for some particular qualities of rice. There are a few mountain streams and rivers; and the distance of the mountains from the sea is too inconsiderable for the formation of any large river. By far the most extensive portion of Malabar lies in the vicinity of the Ghaut Mountains, and consists of low hills separated by narrow valleys, which are in general extremely fertile, being the receptacles of the fine particles of mould carried down from the hills, and which stop when they can be carried no farther. The hills have mostly level summits, which are bare in many parts, especially towards the north, and expose to the view large surfaces of naked rock, with remarkably steep sides; but they are seldom of any considerable height. They are in general very industriously cultivated; their sides, which possess the best soil, being formed into terraces. The valleys are in most cases watered by rivulets which carry off the superfluous water; and where there is no issue, it overflows the adjacent lands. The upland is barren, and the cultivation much neglected; and it is in the valleys and extensive ravines, and upon the banks of the rivers, that the inhabitants chiefly reside. Dr Buchanan mentions that some parts of the country which he passed through in this province were the most beautiful he had ever seen, being equal to the finest parts of Bengal, but the trees were loftier, and the palms more numerous. In many places the rice-grounds are interspersed with high swells, that are crowded with houses; whilst the view to the north is bounded by naked rocky mountains, and to the south by the lofty forests of the Travancore hills.^[1. See Journey from Madras, through Μya e, Canara, and Malabar, by F. Buchanan, Μ. D. vol. ii. p. 347∙ ] The climate is moist; the low country of Malabar, as well as the whole region which lies under the Western Ghauts, becomes excessively hot in the month of February; and the vapours and exhalations are so thick, that it is difficult to distinguish objects at the distance even of five miles. These vapours may be viewed from the mountains, where the cold is very severe. The moisture collected increases with the heat; and in March and April a prodigious quantity is accumulated, and floats in the atmosphere, sometimes ascending nearly to the tops of the mountains, where it is checked or condensed by the cold; but, descending immediately after, it is again rarefied by the heat of the lower atmosphere, into vapour, before it reaches the earth. At the setting in of the western monsoon, the whole is condensed into rain, which falls very heavily, partly in the low country, and partly in the mountains; and a small portion escapes and is blown across Mysore. These heavy rains serve to bear away the soil, and leave nothing but loose stones and sand upon the hills. The country abounds in lofty forests, which are sometimes intermixed with cornfields and plantations of fruit-trees. The teak is produced in great abundance, mostly about Manarghaut; but it is too remote from any navigable river to be transported with a profit from the place of its growth. Sandal-wood is also exported from Malabar, though it is not the produce of the country; at least such as is found within the limits of Malabar is not of a good quality, being entirely devoid of smell; but, growing as it does immediately to the eastward of the Western Ghauts, all that is produced towards the sources of the Cavery naturally comes to Malabar, which affords the nearest ports that can be found for its exportation. The palm is produced in the greatest abundance about Palighaut, and with proper care an excellent spirit might be extracted from it. These forests, unlike those in India, are the private property of the landholders, who have exercised the right of selling and mortgaging the trees to Moplay merchants. This right is interfered with in a manner equally oppressive and impolitic by the surveyor of forests, an officer appointed with a view to preserve them. Sir Thomas Munro, with his usual enlightened views, remonstrated against his interference with the proprietors of the forests, and pointed out its prejudicial effects upon the interests of all parties concerned, and the grievance was to a certain extent redressed. Cocoa-nut trees abound in the province. Black pepper is produced abundantly in Malabar, and forms the chief export by Europeans, who usually purchase about five eighths of all that is produced, and carry it principally to Europe directly, or to Bombay and China. The remainder is chiefly exported by native traders to the Bay of Bengal, Surat, Cutch, Sinde, and other countries in the north-west of India; and a considerable quantity finds its way to the Arabian ports of Muscat, Mocha, Hodeida, and Aden. They use scarcely any horses, asses, swine, sheep, or goats, in Malabar; and such as arc required for the use of the inhabitants are imported from the east. They have a small breed of cattle and buffaloes; but even these are but little used in the transportation of goods, which arc usually carried by porters. Poultry have been introduced into the country by the Europeans; and common fowl may be had in abundance. In many parts field labour is performed by slaves, who are the absolute property of their lords, and may be sold at pleasure. But. a husband and wife cannot be separated, though parents may be taken from their children. The country is distinguished by the neatness of its villages, which are superior to any in India. They are built of mud, which is neatly smoothed, and are either white-washed or painted; and are much embellished by the beauty and elegant dresses of the Brahmin girls. The villages, as well as the bazars, are the work of foreigners, the aboriginal natives of Malabar living in detached houses surrounded with gardens. The higher ranks use little clothing, but are remarkably clean in their persons; and all ranks are free from cutaneous distempers, excepting the very lowest castes of slaves.\n",
      "The country being intersected by many rivers, and bounded by a high wall of mountains, was protected by these natural obstacles against the torrent of Mahommedan invasion which desolated other parts of India; and it was not till 1766, when it was invaded by Hyder Ali, that it was subjected to a foreign yoke. Hence the original manners and peculiar customs of the Hindus have been preserved here in much greater purity than in other parts of India. Besides the Hindus, who form the great proportion of the inhabitants, the population consists of Moplays or Mahommedans, Christians, and Jews. The Hindus are divided into the following castes; namely, Nam-buries, or Brahmins; the Nairs of various denominations; the Teers or Tiars, who are cultivators of the land, and freemen; the Malears, who are musicians and conjurors, and also freemen; and, lastly, the Patiars, who are slaves or bondmen. Of these castes, the most remarkable are the Nairs, the pure Sudras of Malabar, who all lay claim to be born soldiers, though they are of various ranks and professions. There are altogether eleven ranks of Nairs, who form the militia of Malabar, under the Brahmins and rajahs. They are proud and arrogant to their inferiors; and, in former times, a Nair was expected instantly to cut down a cultivator or fisherman who presumed to defile him by touching his person, or a Patiar who did not turn out of his road as a Nair passed. It is a remarkable custom amongst this class, that a Nair never cohabits with the person whom he calls his wife. He gives her all proper allowances of clothing and food; but she remains in her mother’s or brother’s house, and cohabits with any person or persons she chooses, of equal rank; so that no Nair knows his own father; and the children all belong to the mother, whose claim to them admits of no doubt. This state of manners also prevails in the neighbouring countries of Travancore, Bednore, and Canara.\n",
      "As in Malabar, the ancient Hindu state of property and manners prevails, almost the whole land, cultivated and uncultivated, belongs to individuals, and is held by a right which conveys a full and absolute property in the soil. There are many traditions and conjectures respecting the origin of landed property in those countries; and upon this subject a very full detail will be found in Mr Thackeray’s report on the land tenures and assessments in Malabar,^[2. See Fifth Report of the Select Committee on India Affairs, p. 799. ] in which he, along with Colonel Munro and others, strongly contends, that in th\n",

      "an extensive region of India beyond the Ganges, consisting of a large peninsula, connected, by the isthmus of Kraw, about ninety-seven miles in breadth, with the province of Tenasserim to the north, whilst on all other sides it is bounded by the Eastern Ocean, having on the west the Indian Ocean and the Straits of Malacca, which separate it from Sumatra, and on the east the Gulf of Siam and the Sea of China. It extends from the eleventh to the twelfth degrees of north latitude, and is 775 miles in length, by 125 in average breadth. The country is a long, narrow strip of land, traversed by a chain of lofty mountains, and covered with extensive forests and marshes, so that it is very difficult to penetrate into the interior. A range of extremely bleak mountains runs through it from one extremity to the other; and they give rise to innumerable streams, the courses of which, from the proximity of the mountains to the sea, are short, and they are obstructed at the mouths by bars and sandbanks, so that they cannot be ascended by vessels of any size. At the southern extremity of the continent are the islands of Bintang, Bataug, and Sincapore, with many others, so thickly clustered together, that they are only separated from the continent by narrow straits, and seem to be a prolongation of the land. On the west coast also there are numerous islands, amongst which may be mentioned Pulo Pinang, or Prince of Wales Island.\n",
      "The soil is not remarkable for its fertility, though, like other Malay countries, the coast is well covered with wood, and exhibits a great extent of verdure; but the teak tree has never yet been discovered in these forests. The fruits are excellent and plentiful; but grain is not produced in sufficient quantity, and is therefore imported from Bengal and Sumatra. The jungles, from their density and great luxuriance, are impervious to animals, and game is in consequence scarce. From the rivers, as well as the sea, the inhabitants derive a plentiful supply offish.\n",
      "The political state of Malacca has been subject to many revolutions, having been occasionally dependent on Siam, when that monarchy was in the height of its power, and when its supremacy was owned by the whole peninsula. But since the Siamese have yielded to the increasing power of the Burmans, all the southern portion of the peninsula has shaken off the yoke; and the northern states pay only a moderate tribute. The whole of the sea-coast, from that latitude to Point Romania, is still possessed by the Malays, who are mixed in some places with the Buggesses from Celebes, and who have still a small settlement at Salengore. The northern and inland parts of the peninsula are inhabited by the Patany people, who appear to be a mixture of Siamese and Malays, and who inhabit independent villages. The negro race is found in the interior amongst the aboriginal natives. The great majority of the inhabitants are, however, of the Malay race, who are well known and widely diffused amongst all the eastern islands. The origin of this remarkable race is not very distinctly known. They are understood, however, not to be natives of this country, but to have come originally from the district of Palembang, in the interior of Sumatra, situated on the banks of the river Malaya. Having crossed over about the end of the twelfth century to the opposite continent, they, in 1252, founded the city of Malacca. They are of a daring, restless, and intrepid disposition; their character forming in this respect a striking contrast to that of the timid inhabitants of Hindustan. They are brave in war, but ferocious and vindictive, merciless to enemies and strangers, and capricious and passionate even to friends. They are proud and irascible, carrying the point of honour to excess, with a quick sensibility to the slightest insult, which drives them to a degree of fury bordering on desperation; and it is by a series of what they, in their overwrought fancies, consider to be insults, that they are excited to a state of frenzy which ends in that act of wild atrocity known by the name of running amok, from the word amok, signifying kill, kill. The Malay,when he has resolved on this desperate step, proceeds still farther to inflame his passions, by taking a dose of opium, when he throws loose his black hair, and, drawing his deadly crease, rushes into the streets, thirsting for vengeance, and, crying “kill, kill,” slays every one whom he meets in this furious mood. But it has been found that these unruly passions, which often broke out into violent excesses under the tyrannies of their Dutch rulers, were greatly allayed by kind treatment; and that the Malay, in these circumstances, was transformed into an entirely different character, displaying gratitude, affection, fidelity, and higher sentiments of honour than are found amongst any other class of natives in India. Those Europeans who have engaged them as servants, and who have treated them well, inform us that they found them faithful and attached domestics. The free Malays are an intelligent, active, industrious body of men, engaged, like the Chinese, in foreign trade. They have always addicted themselves to seafaring pursuits, and to piracy, which they follow as if it were a lawful trade; and hence they are the terror of the effeminate Asiatics. Their prows are many of them fine vessels, and navigated with skill; but the Malay, though in general a bold and hardy mariner, is apt to sink under a continuance of cold or bad weather, even sooner than the feeble but more docile lascar of Bengal. Though they have been much circumscribed in their piracies by the maritime superiority of the Europeans in the Eastern Seas, and no longer retain those daring habits which rendered them the scourge of the peaceful trader, they still carry on petty depredations; and trading vessels are sometimes cut off, and their crews murdered with every circumstance of atrocity.\n",
      "The government of the Malays is a rude description of monarchy, with a turbulent aristocracy, or something like the principles of the feudal system. The head of the government is a rajah or sultan, a name assumed from the Arabians; and under him a certain number of nobles, with their train of vassals. But in practice there is no regular system of subordination, the king trampling on the chiefs and the people, and they again rebelling against his authority; so that there is little else amongst them but violence and disorder, which contributes to nourish their ferocious habits.\n",
      "The language of the Malays has obtained very general currency in several states upon the continent, as well as amongst the eastern islands, though it has gained no footing in the interior of Hindustan. On the sea-coast, and at the mouths and on the banks of navigable rivers, it is the medium of commercial and foreign intercourse; and the currency which it has acquired may be ascribed partly to the commercial and enterprising character of the people, who, by their mercantile habits, or the power of their arms, have established themselves in every part of the archipelago, and also to its own valuable qualities of simplicity in the structure, and even of pronunciation. In writing it, they use the Arabic character, with the addition of six other letters. The Malays have few books in their language, and these consist chiefly of transcripts and versions of the Koran, commentaries on the Mahommedan law, and tales in prose and verse, many of them translations of the popular tales current in Arabia, Persia, India, and the neighbouring island of Java. They have also some historical compositions.\n",
      "The Malayans profess the Mahommedan religion. Until the year 1276 they were pagans, or followed some corrupted form of Hindu idolatry. Sultan Mahommed Shah, who ascended the throne in the thirteenth century, was the first prince who, by the propagation of this faith, acquired great celebrity during his long reign of fifty-seven years. His dominion extended over the neighbouring islands of Lingen and Bintang, together with Johore, Patany, Quedah, and Pera, on the coasts of the peninsula, besides several districts in Sumatra, all of which acquired the appellation of Malaya. During part of the fifteenth century, Malacca was under the Siamese sovereigns. In 1509, Sultan Mahmood repelled the aggression of the king of Siam; but in 1511 he was conquered by the Portuguese under Albuquerque.\n",
      "Malacca is the capital of the country of Malacca, and is situated on the straits of the same name, near the southern extremity of the Malay peninsula. The town is large; many of the houses are built of stone; and there are several spacious and handsome streets. But that part of it inhabited by the natives consists of bamboo and mat huts. Since the formation of the British settlement at Pulo Pinang, or Prince of Wales Island, its commercial importance has declined. The surrounding country is fertile and beautiful, being finely diversified for eight miles round with hill and dale; and beyond that distance it is rendered impracticable by woods and morasses. There is a good roadstead for large ships, about a mile and a half from the place; but the entrance to the river is rendered intricate by a bar, over which boats cannot pass before quarter flood, nor after last quarter ebb, without much difficulty. Under the lee of the island, near to the fort, there is a harbour, where, in the south-west monsoon, vessels of light burden may be secured. On the southern side of the river is a fort, the walls of which are in a ruinous condition. The chief imports are grain, which is brought in considerable quantities from Bengal, Java, and Sumatra, opium, piece-goods, silks, and dollars. The exports are chiefly tin, pepper, sago, canes, elephants’ teeth, biche de mer, and some gold dust. Fruits and vegetables are abundant; and there is also plenty of buffaloes, hogs, poultry, and fish, at moderate prices, though sheep and bullocks are scarce. Malacca was founded about the y\n",

      "de Lamoig non de, minister and last counsel to Louis XVI., was descended of an illustrious family, which had occupied the highest offices in the magistracy, being the grandson of the celebrated advocate-general Lamoignon (see Lamoignon), and born at Parison the 6th of December 1721. He was son of the chancellor of France, William de Lamoignon, who was descended of an illustrious family. His early education he received at the Jesuits’ College, and afterwards applied himself with great assiduity to the study of the law, as well as of history and political economy. He was chosen a counsellor of the parliament of Paris at the age of twenty-four, and succeeded his father as president of the court of aids in the year 1750. Alongst with the presidentship of the court of aids, he received the superintendence of the press, and in his hands it became the means of promoting liberty to a degree beyond all former example in that country. As he firmly believed that despotism alone had reason to dread the liberty of the press, he was anxious to give it every extension consistent with sound policy and the state of public opinion. Through his favour the Encyclopédie, the works of Rousseau, and many other free speculations, issued from the press, in defiance of the terrific anathemas of the Sorbonne. This had no doubt its weight in paving the way for the revolution, which Malesherbes did not probably foresee; yet it had also the effect of freeing the minds of men from the fetters of slavery and superstition, and of enlightening thèm respecting their rights and duties in society. The superintendence of the press having been taken from him, and conferred upon Maupeou, he was only the more intent on fulfilling the duties of his presidentship, and opposing arbitrary power. When the proceedings of the court of aids were to be prohibited, on account of the spirited conduct of Malesherbes in the case of Monnerat, who had been unjustly treated by the farmers of the revenue, he presented a remonstrance to the king, containing a free protest against the enormous abuses of lettres de cachet, by which every man’s liberty was rendered precarious, and concluding with these memorable words: “No one is great enough to be secure from the hatred of a minister, nor little enough not to merit that of a clerk.” Soon after this he was banished to his country-seat by a lettre de cachet, and the Duke de Richelieu, at the head of an armed force, abolished the tribunal. In this state of retirement he committed to paper a number of observations on the political and judicial state of France, as well as on agriculture and natural history, all which perished in the wreck of the revolution. On the accession of Louis XVI. to the throne in 1774, he received an order to appear at the place where the court of aids had sat, and to resume the presidentship of the tribunal thus restored. He laid before the new sovereign an ample detail of the calamitous state of the kingdom, with a free exposure of the faults by which it had been produced. His sentiments so fully accorded with those of the young king, that he was chosen minister of state in the year 1775. In this elevated station he was only ambitious to extend the sphere of his usefulness. His first care was to visit the prisons, and to restore to liberty the innocent victims of the former reign. His administration was also distinguished by the encouragement of commerce and agriculture, being-supported in his laudable endeavours by the able and virtuous Turgot, at that time comptroller-general of the revenue. But having failed in his benevolent endeavours to ameliorate the condition of Protestants respecting the solemnization of marriage and the legitimation of their children, he resigned his office in the month of May 1776.\n",
      "Being fond of travelling, and resolved to mix freely with people of every description, in order to acquire an accurate knowledge of human nature, he assumed the humble title of Μ. Guillaume, and commenced his journey in a simple, frugal manner. He travelled through France, Switzerland, and Holland, frequently journeying on foot, and lodging in villages, in order to have a nearer insight of the state of the country. He made memoranda of whatever he conceived to be worthy of observation respecting the productions of nature and the operations of industry; and, after an absence of some years, he returned to his favourite mansion, fraught with such a stock of valuable knowledge as his age and experience qualified him to appreciate. Finding on his return that his native country was far advanced in philosophical principles, he drew up two elaborate memoirs addressed to the king; one of them on the condition of the Protestants, and the other on civil liberty and toleration in general. The difficulties with which ministers now found themselves surrounded induced the king to call him to his councils, being a man who stood high in the esteem of the whole nation; but he received no appointment to any particular office. In the critical state in which he clearly saw that the king stood, he made an effort to open his eyes, by means of two spirited and energetic memoirs, on the calamities of France, and the means of repairing them; but, as the queen’s party carried everything before it, he was not even permitted to read them, and was also denied a private interview with the ill-fated monarch, in consequence of which he took his final leave of the court.\n",
      "When, by a decree of the National Convention, Louis was to be tried for his life, Malesherbes, nobly forgetting the manner in which he had been banished from his councils, generously offered to plead his cause. On the 13th of December 1792, he wrote to the president of the Convention, “J’ai été appelé deux fois au conseil de celui qui fut mon maître, dans le temps où cette fonction était ambitionnée par tout le monde; je lui dois le même service, lorsque c’est une fonction que bien des gens trouvent dangereuse.” He was the person who announced to the unfortunate monarch his cruel fate, and one of the last who took leave of him when taken out to suffer. After this eventful period, he withdrew to his retreat with a wounded heart, and refused to hear anything more of what was passing on the bloody theatre of Paris.\n",
      "Occupied with agriculture and the duties of charity, he was vainly seeking to console himself for the evils of his country, when, in the first days of December 1793, three members of a revolutionary committee of Paris, followed by a numerous escort, came to arrest his eldest daughter, and his son-in-law Μ. de Rosambo. He remained alone with his grandchildren, and for a moment it was believed that his age and his virtues would be respected; but next day new emissaries appeared, and carried him off with his children, notwithstanding the tears and protestations of the inhabitants of Malesherbes, who all offered to guarantee his virtues and his innocence. He then requested to be sent to the same prison with his family; but even this consolation was denied him, and he was incarcerated in the Madelonettes with one of his grandsons, Μ. Louis de Rosambo, whilst his other children remained dispersed in different prisons. When brought before the revolutionary tribunal, he was asked if he had counsel; he replied by a smile of contempt, and one Duchâteau was appointed ex officio his defender. This tribunal of blood would scarcely deign to hear him who had been so long the oracle of justice, and by whom so many victims had been saved from death. He was, indeed, convinced of the uselessness of any defence; and when they handed him the act of accusation (or indictment), in which he was charged with having conspired against “the unity of the republic,” he rejected it with disdain, saying, “Encore si cela avait le sens commun.” In the same charge were included thirty persons of all ages and both sexes. Malesherbes heard his sentence without emotion, and marched to death with undisturbed serenity. At this terrible moment, that mild yet lively gaiety which had formed the charm of his life did not forsake him. Happening to strike his foot against a stone, as he crossed the court-yard of ţhe palace, with his hands tied at his back, he observed to the person next him. “Voilà qui est d’un fâcheux augure; à ma place un Romain serait rentré.” Madame de Rosambo was not less calm nor less resigned. When, on quitting her prison, she embraced Mademoiselle de Sombreuil, who had displayed so great courage during the massacres of September, “Mademoiselle,” said she, “you have had the honour to save your father; I am going to have that of dying with mine.” Malesherbes had the unspeakable grief of seeing immolated before him that daughter λvhom he loved so tenderly, and who herself witnessed the butchery of her children before she was called on to suffer. He perished the last of all, at the age of seventy-two, on the 22d of April 1794.\n",
      "Grave errors may be laid to the charge of Malesherbes, but all of these had their source in that love of good which in him was as much a passion as a principle; and, besides, they were not only expiated by a glorious death, but confessed and bitterly deplored with that noble frankness which belonged to his character. Besides the works already alluded to, Malcsherbes left a number of manuscripts, which were dispersed by the vandalism of the revolution, particularly, 1. Observations sur le Méléze, sur le Bois de Sainte Lucie, sur les Pins, sur les Orchis; 2. Mémoire sur les moyens d’accélérer les Progrès de l’Economie Rurale en France; 3. Idées d’un Agriculteur, &c.; 4. Mémoire pour Louis XVI.; 5. Observations sur l’Histoire Naturelle de Buffon et Daubenton; 6. Mémoires sur la Librairie et la Liberté de la Presse; 7.

      "the discoverer of the laws of the polarisation of light, born at Paris on the 23d of June 1775, was the son of Anne Louis Malus du Mitry, and of Louisa Charlotte Desboves, his wife.\n",
      "His father had a place in the Treasury of France, and gave him at home an excellent education in mathematics and in the fine arts, as well as in classical literature, with which he rendered himself so familiar as to retain many passages of the Iliad in his memory throughout life. At seventeen he was admitted, after a severe examination, as a pupil of the School of Military Engineers; and about the same time he amused himself with writing a regular tragedy in verse on the death of Cato. He soon distinguished himself in his military studies, and he was about to obtain a commission as an officer, when an order of the minister Bouchotte imputed to him the offence of being a suspected person, probably on account of the situation held by his father, and he was dismissed from the school. He was then obliged to enter the army as a private soldier in the fifth battalion of Paris, and he was employed in this capacity upon the fortifications of Dunkirk. Here he was soon distinguished by Mr Lepère, the director of the works, as superior to his accidental situation; and he was selected as one of the young men who were to constitute the members of the Eco<,e Polytechnique, then to be established upon the recommendation and under the direction of Monge, who immediately chose him, from a previous knowledge of his merit, as one of the twenty who were to be made instructors of the rest. This body constituted, at that moment, the only refuge of the sciences in France, and the enthusiasm of its members was proportionate to the advantages which they enjoyed, and to the importance of the trust committed to them. In the three years which he passed in this institution, he was much employed, amongst other applications of the higher geometry, in pursuing the mathematical theory of optics, a department of science in which he was afterwards so eminently to distinguish himself by experimental discoveries. He was then, however, obliged to abandon for a time the pursuit of scientific investigations, and he was admitted into the corps of engineers, with the seniority of his former rank in the school. He served in the army of the Sambre and Meuse; he was present at the passage of the Rhine in 1797, and at the affairs of Ukratz and Altenkirch. Whilst he was in Germany, he formed an engagement with Miss Koch, the daughter of the chancellor of the University of Giessen; and he was on the point of marrying her, when he was obliged to join the Egyptian expedition. He was present in that campaign at the battles of Chebreïs and of the Pyramids; he was also present at the affair of Sabish, at the siege of El Arish, and at that of Jaffa. After the surrender of that place, he was employed in the repairs of the fortifications, and in the establishment of military hospitals. Here he was attacked by the plague, and fortunately recovered from it without any medical assistance. He was then sent to fortify Damietta; he was afterwards at the battle of Heliopolis, at the affair of Ceraim, and at the siege of Cairo. After the capitulation with the English, he embarked on board of the transport Castor, and arrived in France on the 26th of October 1801. His health was exhausted and his spirits were broken by fatigue and anxiety; but his attachment to his betrothed bride was undiminished, and he hastened to Germany to fulfil his engagement. His fidelity was rewarded, during the eleven years that he survived, by the most constant and affectionate attention on the part of his wife; and she died a year or two after him, a victim to the same disease which had been fatal to her husband.\n",
      "He had, however, enough of strength and vigour of constitution remaining to enable him, besides the official superintendence of the works carrying on at Antwerp and at Strasburg, to pursue the study of his favourite sciences; and upon occasion of a prize question proposed by the In stitute, he undertook the investigation of the extraordinary refraction of Iceland crystal, which the experiments of Dr Wollaston had previously shown to agree very accurately with the laws laid down by Huygens; and besides completely confirming all Dr Wollaston’s results, he had the good fortune greatly to extend the Huygenian discovery of the peculiar modification of light produced by the action of such crystals, which Newton had distinguished by the name polarity, and which Malus now found to be produced in a variety of circumstances, independently of the action of crystallized bodies. It seems natural to suppose that the investigation of the laws of the internal reflection of light, at the second surface of the crystals, must have led him to the discovery of the effects of oblique reflection in other circumstances; but, according to Biot, there was more of accident in his actual progress; for he informs us that Malus had beon looking through a piece of crystal, at the image of the sun, reflected from the windows of the Luxembourg, to the house in the Rue d’Infcr, where he lived, and that he was much surprised to find one of the double images disappear in a certain position of the crystal; although the next day, at a different hour, he could no longer observe the phenomenon, from the alteration of the angle of incidence.\n",
      "I he merit of his discovery was soon acknowledged by his election as a member of the Institute, as well as by the adjudication of a biennial medal from the Royal Society of London, on the foundation of Count Rumford. It has been thought creditable to the Royal Society to have conferred this distinction in the time of a war between the two countries; but if any credit were due for only doing justice conscientiously, it would attach, on this occasion, to those members of the council, who saw their own optical speculations in great danger from the new mass of evidence which appeared likely to overthrow them, at least in the public opinion, and who were still the most active in offering this tribute of applause to the more fortunate labours of a rival.\n",
      "Nor was the remuneration of Malus confined to empty honours only; from the liberality of the French government, he obtained promotion in his own profession as a military man ; and this not for services performed in the field, nor even in a difficult and dangerous expedition to unknown regions, but for experiments made with safety and tranquillity in his own closet. That government had not carried the refined principle of the division of labour so far as to resolve that all public encouragement should be limited to the precise department in which a public service had been performed; and hence a mark of distinction, which a gentleman could accept without degradation, was not deemed an incommensurate remuneration for a discovery in abstract science. Such a refinement, which has been practically introduced into our own country, might appear, to a man who had a heart, something worse than sordid; he might fancy that a great nation, as well as a great individual, should treat its dependents, “not according to their deserts, but after its own honour and dignity.” If, however, a person in office happened to have any thing like a heart about him, the outcry of an indiscriminating opposition would soon teach him to silence its dictates.\n",
      "1. Mr Malus’s first publication appears to have been a paper On an unknown Branch of the Nile, in the first volume of the Décade Egyptienne. 2. He presented to the Institute a mathematical Traité d’Optique, before the completion of his experiments on double refraction; it was published in the Mémoires présentés à l’institut, vol. ii. Paris, 1810. 3. His more important discoveries were first made known in the second volume of the Mémoires d'Arcueil, Paris, 1809, 8vo; and again, 4. in the Theory of Double Refraction, Mém. prés, à ľ Inst. vol. ii., a paper which obtained a prize on the 2d of January 1810. 5. In a short Essay on the Measurement of the Refractive Force of Opaque Bodies, contained in the same volume, he employs the method, before made known by Dr Wollaston, for conducting the experiment, and computes the forces concerned upon the Newtonian hypothesis, applied, however, in a manner somewhat arbitrary to the circumstances of the problem. 6. Remarks on some New Optical Phenomena, Mém. Inst. Sc. 1810, p. 105, Paris, 1814, read 11th March 1811. This paper is principally intended to prove that two portions of light are always polarised together in opposite directions, and that no part of the light concerned is destroyed, “as Dr Young had been inclined to suspect.” The author found that light transmitted obliquely through a number of parallel glasses at a proper angle, becomes at last completely polarised. Μ. Arago had discovered a case which appeared to be an exception to the general law of the polarisation of transmitted light, but it was afterwards readily explained from the theory of the production of colours by interference, as applied to transmitted light. A letter containing the substance of this paper was published in Thomson’s Annals, iii. 257, April 1814, on occasion of some discoveries of Sir David Brewster, which had been supposed to be wholly new. 7. On Phenomena accompanying Refraction and Reflection, p. 112, read 27th May, showing the universality of polarisation at a proper angle, and examining the effect of a metallic surface. 8. On the Axis of Refraction of Crystals, p. 142; describing an apparatus for finding the properties of bodies with respect to polarised light, applied to the determination of the axis of crystals, and to the examination of the structure of organized bodies, which appear in general to have certain axes of polarisation, as well as those which are manifestly crystallized.\n",

      "in Italian, Aldo Pio Manuzio), the first of those justly celebrated printers, illustrious for their learning as well as for uncommon skill in their profession, who were in Italy what the Stephens afterwards became in France. He was born in 1447, at Bassiano, a small town of the duchy of Sermoneta, in the Roman state. He was educated at Rome, and, after completing his course of study, repaired to Ferrara to study Greek under Guarini, a learned professor of that language. In 1482, he quitted Ferrara, then threatened with a siege by the Venetians, and retired to Mirandola, where he was received with distinction by the all-accomplished Pico. Yielding to the entreaties of Alberto Pio, he then went to Carpi, where he was soon joined by Pico, the uncle of the prince. Μ. Renouard conjectures, with much apparent probability, that it was at this time that Aldus conceived the design of forming a printing establishment, with the view of multiplying the best works of the Greek and Latin authors, and that the two princes (Alberto Pio and Pico di Mirandola) undertook to defray the expense of setting up the establishment. In the course of the year 1488, he repaired to Venice, a city which, from its position, its commerce, and the literary taste of its inhabitants, appeared the best suited for his design. His first object was to make himself advantageously known, and, with this view, he commenced by giving public instructions in Greek and Latin; but in the mean time he was very busily occupied in organizing his printinghouse; and at length, in 1494, he published the poem of Hero and Leander in Greek and Latin, which was followed by the Grammar of Lascaris, that of Theodore Gaza, and die works of Theocritus, Apollonius, and Herodian. But it was the publication of the works of Aristotle which placed Manutius in the first rank of printers. It is impossible to form a just conception of the patience and sagacity necessary to read and decipher the manuscripts which served as the basis of this edition, to compare and collate them with one another, to select the best readings when they exhibited variations, and to supply the omissions of the copyists. This edition alone, though less correct than the greater part of those which followed it, would be sufficient to earn for Manιιtius the gratitude of posterity, and to justify all the commendations which have been bestowed upon him. But if we reflect that he published, with the same care, and almost always with the same success, the greater part of the chefs d’oeuvre of Greece; that, in multiplying good books, then so rare, he changed the direction of study, hitherto limited to scholastic theology and a barbarous jurisprudence; and that he thereby contributed in the most essential manner to the progress of the human mind, and the advancement of civilization; we cannot but entertain a sentiment of . profound veneration for the man whose whole life was consumed in a series of labours which will extend their useful influence even to the latest generations. Before this time the greater part of books had been printed in the folio or largest size; Manutius, however, conceived the happy idea of publishing a collection of the Latin classics in a more convenient form, and with this view he had a character cast in imitation (it is said) of the hand-writing of Petrarch, and employed it, for the first time, in the impression df his Virgil which appeared in 1501. This character, long afterwards known by the name of Aldine, and now by that of Italic, was designed and cut by Francesco of Bologna, an artist highly esteemed in his particular line. The multiplicity of works which now issued from his presses having rendered it impossible for one individual to superintend the impressions, he had recourse to the assistance of some learned men, his personal friends; and out of this association of persons united in one common object he formed the Aldine Academy, whose short duration did not prevent it from attaining great celebrity. It reckoned amongst its members, Bembo, Erasmus, Battista Egnazio, and Andrea Navagero, who every year burned, in honour of Catullus, a copy of Martial; the monk Bolzani, the first who wrote in Latin the principles of Greek grammar; Alcyonio, who is accused of having destroyed the only manuscript of Cicero’s treatise De Gloria, after having transferred its finest passages to one of his own works; the Greek Musurus Demetrius Chalcondylas, who published the first edition of Homer; and Ale-andro, afterwards cardinal, who acted a prominent part in the ecclesiastical affairs of the sixteenth century. In 1506, war obliged Aldus to withdraw from Venice; and during his absence his goods were pillaged and his domains seized. He made repeated efforts to recover possession of his property, but, unfortunately, without success. On quitting Milan, where his friends had sheltered him, he fell into the hands of a troop of soldiers, who, taking him for a spy, conducted him to prison at Caneto. But he recovered his liberty, through the good offices of Jaffredo Carolo, vice-chancellor of the senate of Milan, and returned to Venice much poorer than when he left it. In 1507, he resumed his typographical labours; but the want of funds rendered it impossible for him to execute any great work. In these circumstances, Andrea Toresano d’Asola, his father-in-law, came to his assistance; and, in 1512, they formed a partnership, of which Aldus was constituted the head. He then re-opened his printing-house, which for two years had been shut, and resumed his labours with increased activity. But when he was on the point of publishing a Bible in three languages, which would have secured to him the distinction of being the first author of a polyglott, he was in 1515 removed from all his pursuits by death, at the age of about seventy. By his marriage with the daughter of Andrea d’Asola he had three sons and a daughter; but Paolo, his third son, was the only one who followed in the footsteps of his father.\n",
      "The Greek editions which issued from the presses of Aldus are less correct than either the Latin or the Italian editions; but it should be remembered that he had frequently only a single manuscript, incomplete or half effaced, from which to reproduce a work, and that the conservation of many is entirely owing to his laborious patience. The mark of his press, it is well known, is a dolphin coiled round an anchor. Besides the prefaces, and the Greek or Latin dissertations with which he enriched most of his editions, Manutius was the author of several works, which would of themselves have been sufficient to insure to him a distinguished place amongst the learned men of his age, if he had not been the most celebrated printer it produced. Of these works the most important are, 1. Rudimenta Grammatices Linguae Latinae, Venice, 1501, in 4to, very rare; 2. Grammaticae Institutiones Graecae, 1515, in 4to; 3. Dictionarium Graeco-Latinum, 1497,1524, in folio; 4. De Metris Horatianis, a little work often reprinted during the sixteenth century; 5. Scripta Tria longe rarissima denuo edita et illustrata, Bassano, 1806, in 8vo. The Abbé Morelli is the editor of this collection, which contains a poem of ^Aldus, entitled Musarum Panegyris, in two little pieces addressed to the Prince of Carpi. The original edition in 4to, without date, must have appeared before 1489. Manutius translated from Greek to Latin the Grammar of Lascaris, the Batrachomyomachia, the Sentences of Phocylides, the Golden Verses of Pythagoras, and the Fables of AEsop and of Gabrias (Babrius). (See Life of Aldus Manutius the Elder, by Unger, augmented by Geret, Wittenberg, 1753, in 4to; also his Life by Manni.) (a.) Manutius, Paulus, son of the preceding, was born at Venice in 1512, and, after the death of his father, remained under the care of his maternal uncle, Andrea Toresano. Part of his early youth he passed at Asola, where his education was much neglected; but, on his return to Venice, the old friends of his father furnished him the means of gratifying his taste for learning. Under their direction he applied to his studies with such zeal and assiduity, as even to injure his health, and induce his physicians to enjoin a temporary abstinence from labour. But he suffered more domestic disquiet than from the illness thus occasioned. Andrea Toresano died in 1529; and∙the partition of his succession excited keen disputes between his own sons and those of Aldus. Paul, however, entered into an agreement with his uncles, whereby he remained at the head of the printing'establishment, which, having been shut up in 1529, was re-opened in 1533, for the common benefit of the heirs of Aldus and Andrea d’Asola. In imitation of his father, he sought the assistance of learned men, of whose counsels he availed himself; published new editions, particularly of the Latin classics, much more correct than the preceding ones; and enriched them with prefaces, notes, and indexes, the usefulness of which now began to be felt. Being passionately fond of the works of Cicero, which he read and re-read incessantly, in order to form his own style, he published a careful re-impression of the oratorical treatises and familiar letters; and this was followed by a complete edition of the works of the prince of Roman eloquence. But fresh annoyances which he experienced on the part of his uncles forced him to suspend his labours in 1538; and he employed part of that year in visiting the ancient libraries of Tuscany and the Milanese. The partnership which he had formed with the Toresani was at length dissolved; and the printing establishment having been re-opened in 1540, under the name of the sons of Aldus, soon began to recover its ancient splendour. Manutius married in 1546; but the attention which he owed to his wife and his young family did not abate his ardour for study. Frequent illnesses, caused by excessive labour, or the difficulties with which he had to contend, could alone withdraw hi\n",

      "one of the most celebrated Roman generals, the principal events of whose life are included between B. c. 134 and b. c. 86. It is difficult to say whether Marius proved a greater curse or blessing to his country; he saved it, indeed, from the cruelties of a barbarous enemy, but his ambition brought on it more disasters than would have arisen from the most calamitous war. Marius was born about B. c. 157, of poor parents, in the village of Cereatae (Plin. iii. 5), belonging to the district of Arpinum, which was afterwards the birth-place of Cicero, b. c. 106. His youth seems to have been passed amidst the rude discipline of the camp; nor was his disposition at all softened by literature or intercourse with the learned. He commenced his military career at Numantia (b. c. 134), and by his temperance and bravery so won the good opinion of Scipio, that that general answered one of his friends who inquired where they would find another general equal to himself, by putting his hand on the shoulder of Marius and saying, “Here he is.” Many years, however, pass without any allusion to Marius, nor do we know what part he took in the troubled times of the Gracchi. He appears again in history as tribune of the people, b. c. 119, which office he is said to have obtained chiefly through the influence of the consul Metellus, whose implacable enemy he afterwards became. He began immediately to court the favour of the people, and proposed a law which tended to lessen the authority of the patricians in matters of judicature. The consul Cotta persuaded the senate to summon Marius to answer for his conduct; but the bold tribune threatened to send even the consul Metellus to prison if he persisted in opposition to this measure. The senate gave way, and the law was subsequently confirmed by the people. He was thus supposed to have embarked in the popular cause; but this opinion changed when it was found that he strenuously opposed the distribution of corn amongst the people. When his year of office had expired, he stood as candidate for that of curule aedile, but was rejected; upon which he applied for that of plebeian aedilc, and in this too he was unsuccessful. Not long afterwards he stood for the praetorship, and was returned last of the six, and not without the suspicion of bribery. He was tried, and escaped only by an equality of votes. The following year he was sent to Farther Spain, which he soon cleared of the banditti who infested the province. On his return to Rome he was anxious to take part in the administration of public affairs, but he had neither riches to buy favour nor eloquence to command it. Still, by his high spirit, by his indefatigable industry and simple mode of living, he became a favourite with the people, and acquired sufficient reputation to be thought worthy of the alliance of the Caesars. He married Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar. When Metellus was appointed, B. c. 108, to the command of the war against Jugurtha, he took Marius as one of his lieutenants into Africa. Marius does not appear to have considered himself as in the least obliged to Metellus for this appointment, but only regarded it as the means of raising himself to a still higher eminence. He took every method of acquiring the good will of the soldiers, and even pointed out to them the faults which their general had committed. In this way he succeeded in persuading all that he alone was able to terminate the war. Marius determined to stand as candidate for the consulship, and pressed Metellus to grant him leave of absence to proceed to Rome. Metellus ridiculed his pretensions to such a high office, and, laughing, asked him if he would not be satisfied to stay and be consul with his son, who was then very young. He at last, however, granted permission, though only twelve days before the election; and by great good fortune Marius got to Rome in six days. The people were already favourably inclined to Marius; and as he was not scrupulous as to the accusations he brought against Metellus, and the promises he made, the people elected him consul, B. c. 107, with great applause. He immediately began to levy troops, without paying any attention to the respectability of the individuals whom he enlisted. Hitherto only people of property had been intrusted with arms, but now Marius enrolled even slaves amongst his soldiers, or at least capite censu being those who were so poor as to pay no con tribution to the state. He then returned with his troops to Africa, which Metellus left, grieved and indignant that the honour of closing the war should have thus been snatched from him by a man towards whom he had shown so much kindness. Marius, however, did not reap the glory which he had expected, for he was in a great measure deprived of it by his quaestor Sylla. Jugurtha had fled to his father-in-law Bacchus, king of Mauritania; and that prince, after some deliberation, delivered him alive (b. c. 105) into the hands of Sylla. (See Jugurtha.) It was this circumstance which laid the foundation of that violent and implacable quarrel which almost ruined the empire. Rome was at this time threatened by an invasion from the Cimbri and Teutones, a northern people who, having issued from their woods in Germany, had overrun the whole of Gaul. The Romans were in the utmost consternation, and no one seemed more able to protect them against these barbarians than Marius. Though absent, he was elected consul a second time, B. c. 104, and received orders to return home with his army. On his arrival he obtained the honours of a triumph, and then devoted himself to the discipline of the levies which he raised. The barbarians, however, passed into Spain, and during the whole of this year Italy had a respite from her enemies. Marius was continued in the consulship, B. c. 103, and was elected the fourth time, b. c. 102, when the barbarians, with an innumerable army, approached the northern frontiers of Italy. Marius, hearing of the enemy’s approach, hastened across the Alps, and pitched his camp near the mouth of the Rhone. The camp was. fortified and well provisioned; and, that it might communicate with the sea, he employed his men in making a cut or canal capable of receiving ships of considerable burden. This canal of Marius has been long filled up, and is now known by the name of Le bras mort. The Teutones and Am-broncs were the part of the barbarian army opposed to Marius. The Cimbri had gone in the direction of the Tyrol to attack Catulus. The Teutones found the camp of Marius too strong to be taken; and as their numbers soon caused a scarcity of provisions, they determined to proceed into Italy. Marius, however, hung upon their rear; and finding a favourable opportunity to attack them near Aquae Sestiae (now Aix, in Provence), he completely defeated them, and in memory of his success erected a pyramid, the remains of which are still to be seen near Saint Maximin. Whilst he was sacrificing in honour of this victory, he received intelligence that he had been elected fifth time consul, b. c. 101.\n",
      "Marius returned to Rome, where he was offered a triumph, which he declined. He then proceeded to the assistance of his late colleague Catulus, who was guarding the north of Italy against the Cimbri. His arrival gave confidence to Catulus; and as soon as the army from Gaul arrived, they crossed the Po to check the barbarians who were ravaging the country on the opposite side. The Cimbri deferred the combat till the arrival of the Teutones, whom they were unwilling to believe to have been destroyed; and in the meanwhile sent to demand lands and cities from Marius, which should be sufficient for themselves and brethren. “Your brethren,” said Marius, “have land enough which we have already given them, and they shall have it for ever.” A decisive battle was fought a short time afterwards (30th July) in the plain of Vercellae; and though the victory was almost wholly due to the bravery and good conduct of Catulus, Marius carried off all the honour, and was named the third founder of Rome. The survivors of the Cimbri are said to have fled to the mountains of Verona, to the district called Les Sept Communes, and their descendants are supposed still to be found there. (See Marco Pezzo on this people, and their peculiar dialect, Verona, 1763.) Marius then returned to Rome, where he  enjoyed the honour of a triumph, along with his colleague Catulus. He then began to exert all his influence to get himself re-elected to the consulship, and he omitted no means, however dishonourable, that might conduce to his success. His rival was his old friend Metellus; and he carried matters so far that Metellus was obliged to go into voluntary banishment. (See Metellus.) Marius succeeded (b. c. 100) for the sixth time, and now tried to regain the good will of the nobility; but in this attempt he was so little successful, that he refused to stand candidate for the censorship, lest he should suffer a repulse. Metellus was recalled next year, and, that he might not witness his triumphant entrance, Marius left Rome for the East, under the pretence of performing some vow to the mother of the gods. There he tried to excite Mithridates against his country, thinking that he was certain of a return to power if war should arise. For ten years, however, Marius was disconnected with public affairs; but when the Marsian or Social War broke out (b. c. 90), he was appointed to the command. Age, however, had quenched his martial ardour, and his reputation suffered as much as that of Sylla increased. When the Social War had been concluded, b. c. 88, the Romans saw that they must commence the contest with Mithridates. The enmity of Marius and Sylla now broke out in open war, as they were both anxious to be appointed to the command. Sylla was supported by the senate, but Marius excited a sedition through the tribune Sulpitius, and received the appointment. Sylla was already at some distance from Rome, at the head of an army st\n",

      "----\n",
      "is a contract entered into between two persons of different sexes, with a view to one undivided state or society for life. It has its origin in the constitution, and is nearly coeval with the history, of man; and the first occasion of its occurrence is represented to us in holy writ as having taken place under the immediate direction of the All-wise Creator. It is, therefore, in a peculiar sense, an institution of divine providence; and all the positive laws of man for the regulation of marriage should intend and operate its maintenance and protection.\n",
      "To constitute a valid marriage with us, it is necessary that the parties should lie under no disability preventing them from entering into the contract; that they should be willing to contract; and that the contract should actually be completed.\n",
      "Consent is obviously essential to marriage. Those, therefore, who are incapable of consent are of course incapable of marriage; and so idiots are incapable of marriage, and lunatics, except during a lueid interval. With regard to the employment of force to effectuate a union, it is utterly subversive of society, and must be everywhere regarded as a high crime. The language itself bears testimony to the same fact, license and desire being pre-eminently sexual license and sexual desire, as if licentiousness and lust were the parents of all moral and social disorder.\n",
      "Incapacity to consent may be conceived to include under it another disability, namely, want of age and immaturity of judgment, the usual attendant on early years. But this has another foundation, namely, physical immaturity; and upon these two grounds it has been the policy of most nations to disallow the marriage of infants. Eighteen and twenty were the usual ages of marriage for males with those northern nations amongst whom the Roman laws had not been introduced; but amongst the Lombards the age of marriage was fourteen for males and twelve for females, as in the Roman law; and such is also the law of this country. The framers of the Code Civil, however, justly conceive those ages unsuited to our customs and climate, and accordingly fix the age at eighteen for males and fifteen for females, but with a power in the government to dispense with the age upon cause shown. The canon law, on the other hand, attends only to physical considerations and allows persons of every age to marry, provided onlj they are habiles ad matrimonium. In the Mosaic law there was no restraint on marriage merely in respect of age but then it is to be remembered here, that amongst the Jews the parental influence and authority were perfectly sufficient to prevent premature marriage; whilst yet, on the other hand, the importance of marriage was, from circumstances peculiar to that people, perfectly sufficient to prevent undue obstruction.\n",
      "Another disability is a prior marriage subsisting, or the having another husband or wife living at the same time: polygamy, though practised by many nations, both ancient and modern, being expressly condemned by Scripture, and contrary to all sound policy.\n",
      "A further disability is relationship by birth or by affinity. Amongst the Athenians, no other relationship but that of parent and child formed a bar to marriage, with the exception of brothers and sisters, the intermarriage of whom was forbidden, in order to prevent the union of inheritances. But in this the Athenians were singular; and in the law of Scotland, where the Levitical law of marriage is adopted, the intermarriage of ascendants and descendants is forbidden to the remotest degree, as is likewise that of collaterals in loco parentis, and also of the whole or half blood who are within the second degree, thus allowing cousins-german, and all of more remote degree, to intermarry. In the case of affinity or of relationship by marriage, the husband and wife being in law but one person, the blood relations of either are held as related by affinity in the same degree to the one spouse as by consanguinity to the other. With regarďto illegitimate kindred, it is held that the impediments of consanguinity and affinity apply no less to such persons than to those lawfully related; on this principle, that the state and condition of bastardy, or rather the forms of marriage, are but of civil institution only.\n",
      "There is a still further disability, the disability i before alluded to, namely, physical incapacity; but this is only a ground on which a marriage may be declared void at the instance of either of the parties, and not itself a nullity pleadable by others.\n",
      "By an act of the parliament of Scotland, 1600, c. 20, it was further declared that all marriages contracted by persons divorced for adultery, with the person with whom they had been judicially found to have committed the crime, should be null and unlawful, and the issue born thereof be incapable to succeed as heirs to their parents. But it does not appear that this statute has ever been acted on by the courts.\n",
      "The next particular we noticed as requisite to marriage was, that the parties should be willing to contract; on which particular we need not dwell, the will of the parties being clearly, from what we have already stated, of the essence of the contract. Indeed we have adopted, from the civil law, the maxim, Consensus non concubitus facit nuptias.\n",
      "The last requisite on this head is, that the parties do actually contract, or that effect be given to their declared intentions.\n",
      "To give a distinct origin to the important relation of husband and wife, and also solemnity to the engagement, it has been the practice of most countries to enter on marriage with a ceremony in which the ministers of religion have commonly assisted. In Scotland, as early as the middle of the thirteenth century, we find it enacted by one of the canons of a provincial council held at Perth, that no faith should be given to any one regarding a marriage not eelebrated before a priest, and three or four witnesses specially called for the occasion. Whether these canons were ever ratified by the civil power is not clear; but a distinction exists, and has long done so, between marriages celebrated in t ∕h<fie ecclesiae, and what are called clandestine marriages. Both kinds, however (as came also to be the doctrine of the canon law), are valid; and, moreover, the deliberate consent of parties entering into a present agreement to take each other for husband and wife, or their solemn acknowledgment, written or verbal, of their having done so,constitutes a marriage in law, whether proof of formal celebration be offered or not. By a statute of the Scottish parliament, also, passed upwards of fifty years before the Reformation, 1503, c. 77, it was enacted, that where a marriage has not been disputed in the lifetime of the parties, the widow, being reputed and holden the lawful wife of the deceased in her lifetime, shall have the dower, or tierce as it is called, and enjoy the same without hindrance, “aye and quhil it be clearly decerned, and sentence given, that she was not his lawful wife.” The law ofEngland is altogether different; the mode of contracting marriage having been regulated there by special statute since the middle of the last century, previous to which time, however, the marriage law of both countries appears to have been, generally speaking, the same. But in Scotland there is this remarkable peculiarity, that, in the absenee of a special provision to the contrary, marriage is held incomplete to many purposes, till it has subsisted for a year and day, or living issue be born thereof. This is said by Lord Stair to have been derived from the Roman law; and certainly we find there, that if a woman who had no parent, by the consent of her guardians, after espousal, lived with a man as his wife for one year, without being absent for three nights, she became the lawful wife of such man by what was termed usucaption. But this is plainly different from the custom of Scotland, which we rather think had its origin in the practice of hand-fastening, once prevalent in that country. (See Lindsay’s Chronicles of Scotland, p. 66; Martin’s Western Isles, p. 114; Forsyth’s Scotland, vol. ii. p. 284.) According to the law as it now stands, if a marriage have not subsisted for year and day, or produced a living child, all rights granted in consideration of the marriage become void, and things return to the same condition in which they stood before the marriage, unless special stipulation be made to the contrary. The husband has no right to courtesy, nor the widow to her dower; the tocher is paid back, and the moveable funds still extant are restored to the party to whom they originally belonged.\n",
      "Let us now attend to some of the chief consequences resulting from the matrimonial engagement. By marriage, the husband and wife become one person in law; and on this unity depend almost all the rights and disabilities which cither of them acquires or incurs by their intermarriage. This unity, however, does not operate in the same way as in the case of the contract of partnership, where every member of the company represents all, and may bind all, but upon the principle of the subjection of the wife to the husband. Whilst, therefore, the moveable property of the parties is ipso jure formed into a common fund, the husband is also ipso jure the administrator of that fund. He is the head of the family, and the proper curator of his wife, over whom also he is invested with a large marital authority; and her very management as head of the domestic economy’· of his house is not in virtue of any' inherent or independent power of her own, but of delegation from him. She has, however, her own peculiar property of paraphernalia, customary gifts, and exclusive provisions; the law will protect her against the cruelty of her husband; and without his consent she may execute a testament or dispose of her property by a mortis causa conveyance. In the case of donations also between husband and wife, either party may re\n",

      "an apostle, was chosen instead of Judas. He preached in Judaea and part of Ethiopia, and suffered martyrdom. (See the Acts of the Apostles, chap, i.) There was a gospel published under Matthias’s name, but it was rejected as spurious; there were likewise some traditions, which met with the same fate.\n",
      "St Matthias’s Day, a festival of the Christian church, observed on the 24th of February. St Matthias was an apostle of Jesus Christ, but not of the number of the twelve chosen by Christ himself. He obtained this high honour upon a vacancy in the college of the apostles, occasioned by the treason and death of Judas Iscariot. The choice fell on Matthias by lot; his competitor being Joseph called Barsabas, and surnamed Justus. Matthias was qualified for the apostleship by having been a constant attendant upon our Saviour during all the time of his ministry. He was probably one of the seventy disciples. After our Lord’s resurrection, he preached the gospel, first in Ju-iaea, and afterwards, it appears, travelled eastward, his residence being principally near the junction of the river Ap-sarus and the haven of Hyssus. The barbarous people treated him with great rudeness and inhumanity; and, after many labours and sufferings in converting great numbers to Christianity, he obtained the crown of martyrdom, but by what kind of death is uncertain. There existed a gospel ascribed to St Matthias, but it was universally rejected as spurious.\n",
      "Μ ATTO-GROSSO, or Great Thicket, is a province of Brazil. It is bounded on the north by Para, and on the south by Paraguay, extending in this direction about nine hundred miles. The rivers Araguaya and Parana separate it on the east from the provinces of Goyaz and San Paulo; and on the west the rivers Madera, Guapore, Jauru, and Paraguay, divide it from Peru and La Plata. Its greatest breadth, which is in the upper part, where it borders on Para, is about 950 miles, and it continues so for 240 miles, when it rapidly narrows till it joins Paraguay. This is one of those Brazilian provinces the greater part of which still remains in the hands of the unsubdued Indians, the Portuguese having only effected partial settlements in the country. It comprises nearly four climates, and is naturally partitioned into three grand districts, of which two are divided into six smaller ones. These seven divisions are Camapuania on the south; Matto-Grosso proper, Cuyaba, and Bororonia in the centre; and Juruenna, Arinos, and Tippiraquia on the north. Tippiraquia, so called from the Tippiraquia Indians, lying between the rivers Araguaya and Xingu, is altogether unknown, except along its eastern boundary. Arinos and Juruenna, named from the rivers which intersect them, must also still be considered as terra incognita. The rivers Arinos and Juruenna unite to form the great Tapajos. Bororonia, which takes its name from the Bororo Indians, is situated between Goyaz and Cuyaba, and is watered by the San Lourenço. It is destitute of any settlement, except an arraial and register on the Cuyaba road.\n",
      "Camapuania, the southern division of the province, takes its name from the river Camapuan. Except in its northern limits, it is nearly a uniform level; and a great part of its western half is annually submerged by the inundations of the Paraguay, which is said to cover in some parts more than seventy miles of plain. In the north it is intersected by a chain of mountains stretching from east to west, and here the Paraguay and its branches have their origin, flowing to the southward, and the heads of the Tapajos and the Xingu, which take a northerly course. This canton is divided into east and west by a cordillera of inconsiderable elevation, called the Serra Amambahy. From this chain of hills numerous other rivers have their origin, so that the whole is in every part well watered, and might be rendered a valuable country in the hands of civilized men. The only povoaçoes in this district are the fazenda of Camapuan, situated in latitude 19. 36. S.; and Miranda, a prezidio on the river Aranhary or Mondego, founded in 1797. Attempts have been made by the Spaniards to establish themselves at several points in this district, but without success.\n",
      "Of the savage nations who retain undisputed possession of this country we can afford but a brief account. The most formidable are the Guaycurues, who are still a populous nation, divided into various hordes, and dwelling chiefly on the eastern side of the Paraguay, from 19. 28. to 23. 36. south latitude. Those who inhabit the western side of this river hold no alliance with other nations. Indeed the various tribes are declared enemies to each other, although no difference of origin, idiom, or usage has been observed amongst them. They recognise three degrees of rank; the first, called captains, seems to be equivalent to noblesse or lords of the soil√the second, denominated soldiers, are a species of hereditary vassals, whose military servitude descends from sire to son; and the third are captives or slaves, being the prisoners of war and their descendants. The Guaycurues are of medium stature, well made, healthy, robust, and capable of executing painful and laborious undertakings. The men are diligent in hunting, fishing, gathering honey, and wild fruits, and in the manufacture of arms and canoes. The women spin, manufacture clothes and girdles of cotton, and make cords, mats, and other articles. They rear all the species of domestic birds and quadrupeds introduced into the country, but agriculture they hold in contempt. They are excellent horsemen, being almost constantly on horseback, so that they constitute a very formidable cavalry in their cruel wars, and are in consequence much dreaded by the surrounding nations. Like the Arabs, they have no permanent dwelling-places, shifting their residences according to circumstances, but always encamping near some river or lake. The woods which border on the Igatimy, the Miaιnaya, and the Esco-pil, streams flowing from the Serro Amambahy into the Parana, are inhabited by the Cahans, or people of the wood, so called to distinguish them from their enemies the Guaycurues, who keep the open country. From the accounts which we have of this semi-civilized tribe, they appear to be descendants of some of the Indians civilized by the Jesuits of Paraguay. They cultivate the cotton-tree, the produce of which they spin and weave in a manner peculiar to themselves. They live in villages, and have amongst them men who pretend to be at once surgeons, doctors, divines, and priests. They carry in their hands a cross; and, in their religious observances, solemnity is strongly blended with the wildest extravagance.\n",
      "The cantons of Cuyaba and Matto-Grosso are, properly speaking, the only districts of the province which have been colonized. The latter contains the official capital, Villa Bella, which is situated in a champaign country, near the margin of the Gnapore. It is a neat small city, and contains, besides the residence of the governor and the ouvidor, a smelting-house, the parochial church, and two hermitages. The Guapore, which the Spaniards call Itenez, whilst it sometimes goes by the name of the Mamore, originates nearly one hundred miles north-east of the capital. After flowing eighty miles in a southerly course, it runs nearly the same distance in a westerly direction; it then curves towards the north-west and westnorth-west, and ultimately joins the Mamore, forming the majestic Madera. The banks of this stream are for the most part swampy and unhealthy. From the western side of a continuation of the Serra Paricis, issue a number of rivers, which join it by the right margin; but the largest does not exceed one hundred miles in length. Thirty miles to the east of the Guapore, the Jauru originates, in the campos of the Serra Paricis, and, after a lengthened southerly course, bends to the east-south-east, and falls into the Paraguay in lat. 16. 24. south. At this confluence, one hundred and seventy miles south-east of Villa Bella, a stone with an inscription was erected in 1754, as a boundary mark between the Spanish and Portuguese territories. The northern portion of the canton is occupied by the Serra Paricis, an elevated range, with extensive sandy campos on its summits, inhabited by various aboriginal tribes.\n",
      "To the cast of Matto-Grosso is the canton of Cuyaba, probably the most valuable, as it is the most richly diversified part of the province. It is said to abound with spacious plains, superb woods, and gently undulating elevations, which occasionally assume the aspect of mountains, and the greater portion is irrigated by numerous rivers. The Cuyaba, from which the district derives its name, traverses it from north to south, and falls into the Lourenço in lat. 17. 20. The latter river separates it from Bororoņia, on the east and south, whilst the Paraguay bounds it on the west. Villa Real de Cuyaba, the capital, is a larger and more flourishing place than Villa Bella. It is situated near a small river, at one mile’s distance from the Cuyaba. The streets are mostly paved, and the houses, as well as a church and three chapels which it contains, arc built of taipé. The population amounts to about 30,000. The orange-tree grows here luxuriantly, and the melon, water-melon, and pine-apple also flourish; as well as mandioc, maize, cotton, and sugar, which are cultivated by the inhabitants. Villa Maria, which is situated on the eastern bank of the Paraguay, twenty-five miles from the mouth of the Jauru, is the only other place of any consideration in the canton. Its inhabitants are chiefly Indian, but its position is excellent, and it may probably yet become an important commercial town. The adventurous Paulistas, who first formed settlements in this remote district, were attracted thither by the gold which the country afforded. The early explorers found it in great quantities, and a vast number of persons belonging to San Paulo were induced to undertake \n",

      "de, a celebrated French academician, was born at St Malo in the year 1698, and privately educated there until he attained the age of sixteen, when he was placed under the celebrated professor of philosophy Μ. le Blond, in the college of La Marche, at Paris. He soon discovered a passion for mathematical studies, and particularly for geometry. In his early years he likewise practised instrumental music with great success, but fixed on no profession till he was twenty, when he entered into the army. He first served in the Gray Musqueteers; but, in the year 1720, his father purchased for him a company of cavalry in the regiment of La Rocheguyon. He remained only five years in the army, during which time he pursued his mathematical studies with great vigour; and it was soon remarked by Fréret and other academicians, that nothing but geometry could satisfy his active soul and unbounded thirst for knowledge. In the year 1723 he was received into the Royal Academy of Sciences, and read his first performance, which was a memoir upon the construction and form of musical instruments (15th November 1724). During the first years of his admission, he did not wholly confine his attention to mathematics; he dipped into natural philosophy, and discovered great knowledge and dexterity in observations and experiments upon animals. If the custom of travelling into remote climates, like the sages of antiquity, in order to be initiated into the learned mysteries, had still subsisted, no one would have conformed to it with greater eagerness than Μ. de Maupertuis. His first gratification of this passion was to visit the country which had given birth to Newton; and during his residence at London he became as zealous an admirer and follower of that philosopher as any one of his own countrymen. His next excursion was to Basil in Switzerland, where he formed a friendship with John Bernoulli and his family, which continued till his death. At his return to Paris, he applied himself to his favourite studies with greater zeal than ever. To ascertain how well he fulfilled the duties of an academician, it is only necessary to run over the Memoirs of the Academy from the year 1724 to 1736, in which it appears that he was neither idle nor occupied by objects of small importance. The most sublime questions in geometry and the relative sciences received from his bands that elegance, clearness, and precision, so remarkable in all his writings. In the year 1736 he was sent by the king of France to the polar circle to measure a degree of latitude, in order to ascertain the figure of the earth, accompanied by MM. Clairaut, Camus, Le Monnier, the Abbé Outhier, and Celsius the celebrated professor of astronomy at Upsal. This distinction rendered him so famous, that at his return he was admitted a member of almost every academy in Europe.\n",
      "In the year 1740 Maupertuis received an invitation from the king of Prussia to go to Berlin, which was too flattering to be refused. His rank amongst men of letters had not wholly effaced his love for his first profession, namely, that of arms. He followed his Prussian majesty into the field, and was a witness of the dispositions and operations which preceded the battle of Mollwitz; but he was deprived of the glory of being present when victory declared in favour of his royal patron, by a singular kind of adventure. His horse having, during the heat of the action, run away with him, he fell into the hands of the enemy, and was at first but roughly treated by the Austrian soldiers, to whom he could not make himself known, from ignorance of their language; but being carried prisoner to Vienna, he received such honours from their imperial majesties as were never effaced from his memory. From Vienna he returned to Berlin; but as the reform of the academy which the king of Prussia then meditated was not yet mature, he went back to Paris, where his affairs called him, and was in 1742 chosen director of the Academy of Sciences. In 1753 he was received into the French Academy, which was the first instance of the same person being at the same time a member of both the academies at Paris. Μ. de Maupertuis again assumed the character of a soldier at the siege of Friburg, and was pitched upon by Marshal Cogny and the Count d’Argenson to carry the news to the French king of the surrender of that citadel.\n",
      "He returned to Berlin in the year 1744, when, by the good offices of the queen-mother, a marriage was negotiated and brought about between him and Mademoiselle de Borck, a lady of great beauty and merit, and nearly related to Μ. de Borck, at that time minister of state. This determined him to settle at Berlin, as he was extremely attached to his new spouse, and regarded this alliance as the most fortunate circumstance of his life.\n",
      "In the year 1746, Μ. de Maupertuis was declared by his Prussian majesty president of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and soon afterwards was honoured with the order of Merit. However, all these accumulated honours and advantages, so far from lessening his ardour for the sciences, seemed to furnish new allurements to labour and application. Not a day passed but he produced some new project or essay for the advancement of knowledge. Nor did he confine himself solely to mathematical studies. Metaphysics, chemistry, botany, polite literature, all shared his attention, and contributed to his fame. At the same time he had, it seems, a strange inquietude of spirit, with a morose temper, which rendered him miserable amidst honours and pleasures. Such a temperament did not promise a very pacific life, and in fact he was engaged in several quarrels. He had a dispute with Koenig the professor of philosophy at Franeker, and another of a more serious kin⅛l with Voltaire. Maupertuis had inserted in the volume of Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1746, a discourse upon the laws of motion, which Koenig was not content with attacking, but attributed to Leibnitz. Maupertuis, stung with the imputation of plagiarism, engaged the academy of Berlin to call upon him for his proof, which Koenig failed to produce, and was in consequence struck off the academy, of which he was a member. Several pamphlets appeared on the subject; and Voltaire, for some reason or other, took part against Maupertuis.\n",
      "This is the more unaccountable, because Maupertuis and Voltaire were apparently upon the most amicable terms; and the latter respected the former as his master in the mathematics. Voltaire, however, exerted all his wit and satire against him; and, upon the whole, he was so much transported beyond what was thought right, that he found it expedient in 1753 to quit the court of Prussia.\n",
      "Maupertuis’s constitution had long been considerably impaired by the fatigues of various kinds in which his active mind had involved him; indeed, to the amazing hardships he had undergone in his northern expedition, most of his future bodily sufferings may be traced. The intense sharpness of the air could only be supported by means of strong liquors, which served to increase his disorder, and bring on a spitting of blood, which began at least twelve years before his death. Yet his mind seemed still to possess the greatest vigour; for the best of his writings were produced, and his most sublime ideas developed, during the time of his confinement by sickness, when he was unable to occupy' his chair as president at the academy. He took several journeys to St Malo, during the last years of his life, for the recovery of his health; and though he always received benefit by breathing his native air, yet, on his return to Berlin, his disorder returned with greater violence. His last journey to France was undertaken in the year 1757, when, soon after his arrival there, he was obliged to quit his favourite retreat at St Malo, on account of the danger and confusion into which that town was thrown by the arrival of the English in its neighbourhood. From thence he proceeded to Bordeaux, hoping there to meet with a neutral ship to carry him to Hamburg, on his way back to Berlin; but being disappointed in that hope, he went to Toulouse, where he remained seven months. He had then thoughts of going to Italy, in hopes that a milder climate would restore him to health; but finding himself grow worse, he rather inclined towards Germany, and went to Neufchatel, where for three months he enjoyed the conversation of Lord Marişchal, with whom he had formerly been much connected. At length he arrived at Basil on the 16th of October 1758, and was there received by his friend Bernoulli and his family with the utmost tenderness and affection. He at first found himself much better there than he had been at Neufchatel; but this amendment was of short duration; for as the winter approached his disorder returned, accompanied by new and more alarming symptoms. He languished here many months, during which he was attended by Μ. de la Condamine, and died in 1759. The works which he published were collected into fourvolumes 8vo, published in 1756 at Lyons, where a new and elegant edition was also printed in 1768. These consist of, 1. Essai de Cosmologie, first published at Berlin in 1748; 2. Discours sur la Figure des Astres, first published in 1732; 3. Essai de Philosophie Morale, in which he maintains that the sum of evil surpasses that of good; 4. Reflexions Philosophiques sur l’Origine des Langues et la Signification des Mots; 5. Venus Physique, or an Exposition of the System of Generation; 6. Système de la Nature, first published in 1751, and which maybe considered as the sequel of the preceding work; 7. Lettres, on various subjects; 3. Eléments de Géographie, published at Paris in 1742, and containing an exposition of the means for determining the figure of the earth; 9.

      "an ancient kingdom of Africa, bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by Getulia or Libya Interior, and on the north by the Mediterranean, and comprehending the greater part of the kingdoms of Fez and Morocco. Its ancient limits are not exactly mentioned by any historian; neither can they now be ascertained by any modern observations, these kingdoms being but little known to Europeans.\n",
      "This country was originally inhabited by a people called Mauri, concerning the etymology of whose name authors are not agreed. It is probable, however, that the country, or at least great part of it, was first called Phut, since it appears from Pliny, Ptolemy, and St Jerome, that a river and territory not far from Mount Atlas went by that name. It likewise appears, from the Jerusalem Targum, that part of the Mauri may be deemed the offspring of Lud, the son of Misraim, since his descendants, mentioned in Genesis, are there called Mauτi i or Mauritani. It is certain that this region, as well as the others to the eastward of it, had many colonies planted by the Phoenicians. Procopius tells •us that in his time were to be seen two pillars of white stone, containing the following inscription in the Phoenician language and character: “We are the Canaanites who fled from Joshua the son of Nun, that notorious robber.” Ibnu Rachic, or Ibnu Raquig, an African writer cited by Leo, and also Evagrius and Nicephorus Callistus, make the same statement.\n",
      "The Mauritanians were, according to Ptolemy, divided into several cantons or tribes. The Metagonitae were situated near the Straits of Hercules, now those of Gibraltar; the Saccosii, or Cocosii, occupied the coast of the Iberian Sea; and under these two petty nations the Masices, Vernes, and Verbicae or Vervicae, were settled. The Salisae or Salinsae were situated lower, towards the ocean; and, still more to the south were the Volubiliani. The Maurensii and Herpiditani possessed the eastern part of this country, which was terminated by the Mulucha. The Angaucani or Jangacaucani, Nectiberes, Zagrensii, Baniubae, andVa-cuntae, extended from the southern base of Ptolemy’s Atlas Minor to his Atlas Major. Pliny mentions the Baniurae, whom Father Hardouin takes to be Ptolemy’s Baniubae; and Mela speaks of the Atlantes, whom he represents as possessing the western part of this district.\n",
      "The earliest prince of Mauritania mentioned in history is Neptune; and next to him were Atlas and Antaeus his two sons, both famous in the Grecian fables on account of their wars with Hercules. Antaeus, in his contention with that hero, seems to have behaved with great bravery and resolution. Having received reinforcements of Libyan troops, he cut off numbers of Hercules’s men. But that celebrated commander, having at last intercepted a strong body of Libyans sent to the relief of Antaeus, inflicted on him a total overthrow, in which both he and the greater part of his forces were put to the sword. This decisive action put Hercules in possession of Libya and Mauritania, and consequently of the riches of these kingdoms. Hence arose the fable, that Hercules, finding that Antaeus, a giant of enormous size with whom he was engaged in single combat, received fresh strength as often as he touched his mother earth when thrown upon her, at last lifted him up in the air and squeezed him to death. Hence likewise may be deduced the fable, which intimates that Hercules took the globe from Atlas upon his own .shoulders, overcame the dragon which guarded the orchards of the Hesperides, and made himself master of all the golden fruit it produced. Bochart thinks that the fable alluded chiefly to naval engagements, in which Hercules was for the most part victorious, though Antaeus from time to time received succours by sea; but that at last FIercules, coming up with one of his squadrons which had a strong reinforcement on board, made himself master of it, and thus rendered Antaeus incapable for the future of making head against him. The same author likewise insinuates, that the notion of the gigantic stature of Antaeus, which prevailed for so many centuries amongst the Tingitanians, pointed out the size of the vessels of which his fleets and squadrons were composed. As for the golden apples so frequently mentioned by the old mythologists, they were the treasures which fell into Hercules’s hands upon the defeat of Antaeus; the Greeks giving to the oriental word Hxo, riches, the signification affixed to their own term μriκa, apples.\n",
      "With regard to the age in which Atlas and Antaeus lived, the most probable supposition seems to be that of Sir Isaac Newton. According to that illustrious author, Ammon, the father of Sesak, was the first king of Libya, or of that vast tract extending from the borders of Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean, the conquest of which country was effected by Sesak in his father’s lifetime. Neptune afterwards exeited the Libyans to a rebellion against Sesak, and slew him, and then invaded Egypt under the command of Atlas or Antaeus, the son of Neptune, Sesak’s brother and admiral. Not long after, Hereules, the general of Thebais and Ethiopia, reduced a seeond time the whole territory of Libya, having overthrown and slain Antaeus near a town in Thebais, from that event called Antoea or Antoeopoli s . Such is the notion advanced by Sir Isaae Newton, who endeavours to prove that the first reduction of Libya, by Sesak, happened about a thousand years before the birth of Christ, as the last, by Hercules, did some years afterwards. Now, although we do not pretend to adopt every particular cĩreumstance of Sir Isaae Newton’s system, yet we cannot forbear observing, that it appears evident from Scripture, that neither the western extremity of Libya, nor even the other parts of that region, could possibly have been so well peopled before the time of David or Solomon, as to have sent a numerous army to invade Egypt, sinee Egypt and Phoenieia, whence came the greater part of the ancestors of the Libyans, and which were mueh nearer the place whenee the first dispersion of mankind took plaee, could not have been greatly overstocked with inhabitants any considerable time before the reign of Saul. That such an invasion, however, happened in the reign of Neptune, or at least in that of his son Antaeus, has been most fully evinced by this distinguished chronologist.\n",
      "From the defeat of Antaeus nothing remarkable oeeurs in the history of Mauritania till the times of the Romans, who at last brought the whele kingdom under their jurisdiction. With regard to the customs and manners of this people, it would seem, from what Hygimιs insinuates, that they fought only with clubs, until one Belus, the son of Neptune (as that author calls him), taught them the use of the sword. Sir Isaac Newton is of opinion that this Belus was the same with Sesostris king of Egypt, who overran a great part of the then known world.\n",
      "All persons of distinction in Mauritania went richly attired, wearing gold and silver on their clothes. They took great pains in cleansing their teeth, and curled their hair in a curious and elegant manner. They eombed their beards, which were long, and always had their nails closely paired. When they walked out in any numbers they never touched one another, for fear of disconcerting the curls into which their hair had been formed.\n",
      "The Mauritanian infantry, in time of aetion, used shields made of elephants’ skins, being clad in those of lions, leopards, and bears, whieh they kept on both night and day. The cavalry of this nation were armed with broad, short lances, and carried targets or bueklers made of the skins of wild beasts. They used no saddles. Their horses were small and swift, had wooden collars about their necks, and were so much under the command of their riders, that they followed them like dogs. The habit of these horsemen was not much different from that of the foot already mentioned; they constantly wore a large tunie of the skins of wild beasts. The Phutaei, of whom the Mauritanians were a branch, were eminent for their shields, and the excellent use they made of them, as we learn from Homer, Xenophon, Herodotus, and Scripture. Nay, Herodotus seems to intimate that the shield and helmet came from them to the Greeks.\n",
      "Notwithstanding the fertility of their soil, the poorer sorts of the Mauritanians never took care to manure the ground, being strangers to the art of husbandry, but roved about the country in a wild and savage manner, like the ancient Scythians or Arabes Scenitoe. They had tents, or mapalia, so extremely small that they could scarcely breathe in them. Their food was corn, herbage, &c. which they frequently ate green, without any manner of preparation, being destitute of wine, oil, and all the elegancies as well as many necessaries of life. Their habit was the same both in summer and winter, consisting chiefly of an old tattered though thick garment, and over it a coarse rough tunic, which answered probably to that of their neighbours the Numidians. Most of them lay every night upon the bare ground, though some of them strewed their garments thereon, not unlike the Kabyles and Arabs of our day, who, according to Dr Shaw, use their hykes for a bed and covering in the night.\n",
      "If the most approved reading of Horace may be admitted, the Mauritanians shot poisoned arrows, which clearly intimates that they had some skill in the art of preparing poisons, and were excellent bowmen. This last observation is countenanced by Herodian and AElian, who entirely come into it, affirming them to have been in such continual danger of being devoured by wild beasts, that they durst not stir out of their tents or mapalia without their darts. Such perpetual exercise must have rendered them exceedingly skilful in hurling that weapon. The Mauritanians sacrificed human victims to their deities ? like the Phoenĩcians, Carthaginians, and other nations.\n",

      "INSTITUTIONS have for their object the instruction of the working classes in those branches of science and art, which are of practical application in the exercise of their several occupations.\n",
      "It has been a subject of very considerable controversy to whom the honour of having originated those institutions ought to be attributed. Some have contended that to Professor Anderson, the founder of the institution in Glasgow, which bears his name, it is alone due; because in addition to the clauses in his will, which especially provide for the formation of a class of manufacturers and artificers, he had for a period of thirty years, whilst professor of natural philosophy in the university of that city, opened a class to which manufacturers and others had access, for the purpose of becoming acquainted with the fundamental principles of experimental physics. Others, again, have affirmed that although Professor Anderson had such an intention in view when he framed his will, it was only through the exertions of Dr. Birckbeck, the second professor of the Andersonian Institution, that the project was carried into complete and practical effect. Without going into the merits of this question, however, it appears to us that to Professor Anderson is certainly due the merit of having originated the idea of instructing that previously neglected but valuable portion of the community. But whilst we give all the weight to which that admission is entitled, we are of opinion that in as far as regards the usefulness of the idea when carried into effect, the merit is due to Dr. Birckbeck. Professor Anderson^[1. Professor John Anderson was the eldest son of the Rev. James Anderson, minister of the parish of Roseneatħ, in Dumbartonshire, and was born there in 1726. ] was in the frequent habit of visiting and spending several hours in the workshops of the mechanics of Glasgow, and freely entering into conversation with them; amongst others he was often found at the workshop of our illustrious countryman James Watt, then a watchmaker in Glasgow; and it was in consequence of the avidity with which the workmen, availed themselves of the theoretical information which on these visits he was in the constant practice of imparting, that he first conceived the idea of bringing within their reach those principles of science, the attainment of which had hitherto been confined to the higher and wealthier classes.\n",
      "He then commenced within the walls of the university a course of lectures on natural philosophy, for the especial benefit of that class of society, and divided the course into two branches; one meeting four times a-week, in which the mathematical principles of the science were considered apart from experimental illustration; and the other, which met twice a-week, consisting entirely of those branches which admitted of such illustration, and in which the principles of mathematics were less called into operation. This latter class was regularly and numerously attended by a great many manufacturers and others engaged in operative occupations, and was continued for several years with great success; and he called it his antitoga class, in contradistinction to his regular academic attendance, which was denominated the toga class. It was in consequence of the decided improvement in the arts and manufactures of Glasgow, which from that time became very evident, and which Professor Anderson justly attributed to his instructions, that he conceived the truly philanthropic intention of bequeathing his ample fortune for “the good of mankind and the improvement of science.” In the provisions of his will there was an especial reference to the formation of classes upon the principle of that which he had himself so successfully taught within the walls of the university.\n",
      "Professor Anderson died on the 16th of January 1796; and at a meeting of his executors, held on the 23d of March following, it was resolved to carry his intentions into immediate effect. Accordingly on the 21st of September of the same year, Dr. Thomas Garnett was elected first professor of natural philosophy.\n",
      "The lectures however were at first only popular. Dr. Garnett, in 1800, was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy in the Royal Institution of Great Britain, founded at the suggestion of Count Rumford and Sir Joseph Banks; and Dr. George Birckbeck was elected in his stead. It was then, upon the suggestion of Or. Birckbeck, that the trustees were enabled to give full effect to Professor Anderson’s favourite idea, as expressed in his will, of affording instruction in experimental philosophy to the artizans of Glasgow. Such was the origin of the first mechanics’ class, which has now been taught for upwards of thirty-six years with increasing success and advantage to this interesting class of students.\n",
      "But important as was this era in the history of the class which was thus instituted, it was not until upwards of twenty years afterwards that the example was followed by any other city in the kingdom. At length, however, in 1821, the School of Arts for the instruction of mechanics was formed in Edinburgh; and within a year or two afterwards, the example was followed, and another institution of the same nature was originated in Glasgow, in consequence of some differences which had arisen between Dr. Ure, (Dr. Birckbeck’s successor in the Andersonian Institution), and the students who attended his operative class. A great many of these left the Andersonian and founded the Mechanics’ Institution, of which Dr. Birckbeck, at their solicitation, consented to become the patron. About the same time the London Mechanics’ Institution was instituted, and within a very few years after this period there was hardly a city of any note in the kingdom which had not institutions of a kindred description.\n",
      "As might have been expected, there exists a variety of opinions both as to the precise kind of instruction which these institutions ought to afford in order to carry their objects into the most complete effect, and also in regard to the manner in which they ought to be governed. Some conceive that the course of instruction ought to be of a popular nature, admitting amongst the lectures upon the graver and more abstruse sciences, prelections of a lighter and more attractive kind; whilst others are of opinion that the course ought to be strictly confined to those branches of physical science alone which are of practical application in the arts or manufactures. The management of several, indeed of the greater number, is entirely in the hands of the mechanics themselves; some have an admixture of these with the upper classes of society, whilst in others of a third description, the government is entirely vested in the latter, or wealthier classes.\n",
      "Favourable as we are to the universal diffusion of knowledge amongst the great mass of the people, we conceive, that the paramount object which these institutions have in view, namely, the advancement of the arts and manufactures, will be most decidedly and advantageously promoted, by confining the attention of the student to those branches of the physical sciences which bear more especially on the great majority of the useful arts. We have seen and examined carefully the plans of study as followed by most of the leading institutions of this kind throughout the kingdom; but, whilst we generally approve of them all, we shall confine ourselves to a more extended outline of the course followed by the Edinburgh School of Arts, as being that which seems to us most likely to promote the great objects they all have in view. It being self-evident that the elements of mathematics, mechanical philosophy, and chemistry, are of the most general application to the useful arts, it has been the principal aim of the directors of that institution to urge the necessity of acquiring a knowledge of these upon the notice of the student by every possible means; and especially that they should thoroughly understand the fundamental principles of mathematics, both from the intimate connexion these have with all the physical sciences, and as supplying a course of mental discipline, highly favourable to the successful prosecution, at any after period of life, of those studies the principles of which are more immediately involved in the ordinary occupations of life, and by the application of (which alone any decided improvements in the arts may reasonably be looked for. And in order to encourage the student to adhere steadily to a certain course of study, an honorary certificate or diploma was instituted, conferring on the successful candidate the privilege of availing himself gratuitously, during his life, of all advantages of the institution. That course of study is as follows :—\n",
      "I. A junior class of mathematics meeting twice a-week, in which the following branches are taught: Arithmetic, including vulgar and decimal fractions; Algebra, as far as simple and quadratic equations; Geometry, first and second books of Euclid. In this class, a portion of each hour of teaching is devoted to exercises and examinations.\n",
      "II. A senior class of mathematics meeting once a-week, in which the following branches are taught: Geometry, the remaining books of Euclid; Logarithms; Mensuration and Trigonometry, with their various practical applications. In this class, also, a portion of each hour of teaching is devoted to exercises and examinations.\n",
      "III. A class of Natural Philosophy, illustrated by experiments, meeting once a-week, in which the following branches are taught: Mechanics, including statics and dynamics; Hydrostatics, Hydraulics, Pneumatics, and Optics, with such additional matter as time may permit of. A part of every fourth lecture of this course is devoted to examinations on the subjects treated of in the three preceding lectures.\n",

      "a city of Arabia, and one of the holy cities of the Mahommedans, celebrated for affording refuge to Ma-hoπιmed in his flight from Mekka, for his residence in it, and for his tomb, to which the devout hadjis still resort, although its visitation is not considered as a duty, nor necessary part of the Mahommedan pilgrimage. It is situated on the edge of the great Arabian desert, close to the chain of mountains which traverses that country from north to south, and forms a continuation of the chain of Lebanon. The town is built on the lowest part of the plain, and it is enclosed on three sides with gardens, trees, and walks, leaving only that part of the plain open to the view, whieh is on the side of the road towards Mekka, where the rocky nature of the ground renders cultivation impossible. It is mentioned by Burckhardt, {Travels in Arabia, vol. ii. p. 148,) as one of the best built towns which he saw in the cast, ranking in this respect next to Aleppo. The houses consist generally of two stories; they are built of stone, and have flat roofs. The stone being of a dark colour, the streets present rather a gloomy aspect, and are, with some exceptions, very narrow, being often only two or three paces across; a few of the principal are paved with large blocks of stone, a comfort seldom found in the Arabian towns. Medina is divided into the interior town and the suburbs; the interior forming an oval of about 2800 paces in total circuit, ending in a point. The castle is built at the point, on a small rocky elevation, and the whole is enclosed by a thick stone wall, between thirty-five and forty feet in height, flanked by about thirty towers, and surrounded by a ditch, formed by the Wahabees, and now in many places filled up. Three fine gates lead into the town, one of them the finest town gate, according to Burckhardt, that he had seen in the east. The principal street of Medina, which is also the broadest, leads from the Cairo gate to the great mosque. This street contains most of the shops. Another considerable street runs from the mosque to the Syrian gate; but many of its houses are in ruins. This contains also a few shops, but none arc found in other parts of the town; and in this respect Medina differs from Mekka, which is one continued market. At pre- £ent, especially since the great pilgrimage was interrupted by the incursions of the Wahabees, the town has a desolate appearance; the houses are suffered to go to decay; the crowd of visitors to whom they were in the habit of letting their apartments having diminished, the owners have no prospect of being reimbursed for any extra expense which they may lay out. Ruined houses, and walls wanting repair, are seen in every part of the town; and Medina, like most eastern towns exhibits buta faint image of its ancient splendour. On the west and south of the town, extend the suburbs, which cover more ground than the town itself. An open space intervenes, narrow on the south side, but widening on the west, before the Cairo gate, where it forms a large public place called Monakh, where the caravans alight, and which is always crowded with camels and Bedouins. Here are erected huts and sheds, in which provisions are sold, and a number of coffee huts which are beset all day with visitors. The side of the suburbs which fronts this place has no wall; but on the outside they are enclosed by a wall of inferior size and strength to the interior town wall. Four gates, or rather wooden doors, none of them of any strength except that leading from the Cairo gate, which is larger and better built than the rest, lead into the suburbs. These consist of large court-yards, with low apartments built round them, on the ground-floor, and separated from each other by gardens and plantations, with the exception of the west side directly opposite the Cairo gate, where the suburb consists of regular and well-built streets, with houses resembling those of the interior of the town. Many of the richer inhabitants have their summer houses in these quarters, where they pass a month in the date harvest. Every garden is enclosed by mud walls, and several narrow by-lanes, just broad enough for a loaded camel to cross the suburbs in every direction. The suburbs are principally inhabited by all the lower classes of the town, by many of the Bedouin Arabs who have become settlers there, and by all who are engaged in agriculture. The town is divided into separate hamlets, called hosh, containing thirty or forty families, who often in times of unsettled government, are engaged in desperate feuds with one another.\n",
      "Few large public buildings are found within the precincts of the town. The great mosque, containing the tomb of Mahommed, is the only temple. A fine public school, called Medrese el Hamdye; a similar one near the mosque; a large corn magazine, enclosing a wide yard in the southern quarter of the town; and a bath not far distant from it, built in the year of the hcjira 973 (A.D. 1678,) by Mahommed Pasha i are all the public buildings that were observed by Burckhardt. The want of public buildings, however, in the town is compensated by the numerous pretty private habitations, having small gardens with wells, the water of which is used in irrigation, and fills marble basins, round which in summer time, the owners pass the hours of noon under lofty shades. The castle already mentioned is surrounded by very strong walls, and several high and solid towers. It contains sufficient space for 600 or 800 men; has many arched rooms bomb proof; and would be impregnable against any Arabian force, being built upon a rock, which cannot be undermined. But it would not hold out for any time against European artillery.\n",
      "The great ornament of Medina, which nearly raises the sanctity of the city to a level with that of Mekka, is the great mosque containing the tomb of Mahommed, which is situated towards the eastern extremity of the town; it is inferior in its dimensions to the mosque at Mekka, being 165 paces in length, and 130 in breadth. It is built on much the same plan of an open square, surrounded on all sides by covered colonnades of ten, four, and three rows, on the south, west, and north sides, with a small building in the centre of the square. The roof of the colonnade consists of a number of small domes, white-washed on the outside, in the same manner as those of Mekka. The interior walls are also white-washed except the southern one, which is cased with slabs of marble up to the top, and has several rows of inscriptions in gilt letters. The floor under the collonades is coarsely paved, excepting in those parts nearest to the tomb of Mahommed, where the pavement is mosaic, forming one of the best specimens of that kind of workmanship to be seen in the East. Large and high windows, with glass panes, the only instance of glass in windows that Burckhardt saw in Arabia, some of them of fine painted glass, admit the light through the southern wall. Near the south-east corner stands Mahommed’s tomb, detached from the walls of the mosque, and enclosed by an iron railing painted green, which is entered by four gates. Within the inclosnre is a curtain carried wholly round it, which is said to cover a square building of black stones, supported by two pillars, in which are the tombs of Mahommed and his two earliest friends and immediate successors, Abou Bekr and Omar. These tombs, as far as Burckhardt could learn, are covered with precious stuffs; and here were deposited all sorts of vessels set with jewels, ear-rings, bracelets, necklaces, and other ornaments, brought as presents from all parts of the empire, by the rich pilgrims as they passed through Medina. The whole formed a collection of considerable value; though it was, no doubt, occasionally pillaged by the pious priests who are appointed to the service of the temple, in the same manner as they stole the golden lamps from the mosque at Mekka. Amongst other curious relics, a copy of the Koran in Cufic characters, which belonged to Othman ibn Affan, was deposited here. When Medina was taken by the Wahabees, their chiefs seized all the golden vessels. Saoud, who penetrated behind the curtain, took everything that was valuable, and amongst other precious articles, the Cufic manuscripts of the Koran, and a brilliant star set in diamonds and pearls which was suspended directly over the prophet’s tomb. Several of the golden vessels were re-purchased by Tous-sonn Pasha, the son of Ali Pasha, when he entered Medina in his war against the Wahabees, and replaced in their original situation. The door between the curtain and the railing is inlaid with various coloured marble in mosaic; and here are suspended glass lamps which are lighted every evening, and remain burning all night. The whole of this inclosure is covered with a fine lofty dome, which the Wahabces determined to destroy; but it was so strong that it resisted all their efforts to destroy it. The dome is surmounted with a globe and crescent both glittering with gold. A wooden partition, about eight feet in height, and richly painted with arabesque, runs from the western side of the railing across the mosque, parallel with the south wall, and separates the holy place called El Rodha, or the garden of paradise, from the common passage. Here, on the earpet, the congregation assembles, this being the favourite spot for prayers. The entrance has a splendid appearance; but, says Burckhardt, it is all tinsel decoration, and has a paltry appearance compared with the catholic churches of Europe. The mosque is entered by four gates; and its service is entrusted to forty or fifty eunuchs, who have, like their brethren in Mekka, large stipends annually remitted from Constantinople. Medina is abundantly supplied with water, though not of a very good quality, by a fine subterraneous canal, carried hither from the village of Koba, about two miles distant; and water is everywhere found by digging to the depth of twenty-five or th\n",

      "a large city of Arabia, and capital of the province of the Hcdjaz, one of the holy cities of the Mahommedans, and the annual retreat of innumerable pilgrims, celebrated all over the east as the birth place of Mahommed, and the first seat of his power. It is situated in a narrow and sandy valley, the main direction of which is from north to south; the valley is from one to seven hundred paces in breadth, and the chief part of the city is situated where the valley is broadest. The town itself covers a space of about 1500 paces in length, from the quarter called El Shebeyka, to the extremity of the Mala. But the whole extent of ground comprehended under the denomination of Mekka, from the suburb called Djeronel, where is the entrance from Djidda to the suburb called Moabede on the Tayf road, is 3500 paces. The valley in which the city is built is enclosed by mountains from 200 to 500 feet in height, and entirely barren and destitute of trees. The town is partly built on the sides of the mountains, principally of the eastern chain, where the primitive habitations of the Koreysh and the ancient town appear to have been placed. The city was formerly protected by three walls at its extremities, but they are now decayed and it is open on every side; though the neighbouring mountains form a barrier of considerable strength against an enemy. Mekka may be styled a handsome town; its streets are in general broader than those of eastern cities, which seldom allow a greater space than is required for two camels to pass. But the numerous visitors who are crowded together in this holy city during the pilgrimage render it necessary to leave afn-ple space in the streets. The houses are lofty, many of them being three stories in height, and they are built of stone; and the numerous windows that command a view of the streets give them a more lively and European aspect than the houses in most of the eastern towns, which present but few windows towards the exterior. Few of the houses are whitewashed as at Djidda, being of a dark-coloured stone which is much preferable to a glaring white. Every house has its terrace, the floor of which, composed of a preparation of lime-stone, is built so as to allow the rain-water to run off through gutters into the street. These terraces are concealed from the view by slight parapet walls, as it js reckoned discreditable in the east that a man should appear upon the terrace, whence he might be accused of looking at women on the terraces of neighbouring houses, where they pass much of their time in various domestic duties, such as drying corn, hanging up linen, &c. Almost all the houses, except those belonging to the principal and richest inhabitants, are constructed for the accommodation of lodgers, being divided into many apartments, separated from each other, and each consisting of a sitting room and a small kitchen. The only public place in the body of the town is the ample square of the great mosque. No trees or gardens are interspersed amongst the houses to cheer the eye; but the scene is enlivened during the pilgrimage by the great number of well-stored shops which are found in every quarter. Mekka is more deficient in public buildings than any other eastern city of the same size; having nothing of this description excepting four or five large houses belonging to the scherif or governor, two colleges, now converted into corn magazines, and the mosque with some buildings and schools attaehed to it. Neither khans for the accommodation of travellers or for the deposit of merchandise, nor palaces of grandees, nor mosques, which adorn every quarter of other towns in the east, are here to be seen. This want of public edifices Burckhardt the enterprising traveller, to whose work we are indebted for this account of the holy city, ascribes to the veneration which the inhabitants entertain for their temple, to which they are averse to construct any rival edifice. The streets are all nnpaved, in consequence of which the sand and dust are blown about in summer to the great inconvenience of the passengers; and so deep is the mud during the rainy season that they are scarcely passable after a shower, as the water stagnates in the interior of the town until it is dried up. It may also be ascribed to the destructive rains, which, though of shorter duration than in tropical countries, fall with violence, that no ancient buildings are found in Mekka. Burckhardt is of opinion that there are not any houses more than four centuries old; and hence there are here no interesting specimens of architecture or any such beautiful remains of Saracenic structures as are still admired in Syria, Egypt, Barbary, and Spain. No regulations of police are enforced in Mekka as in other eastern cities. The streets are totally dark at night, no lamps of any kind being lighted; and its different quarters are without gates, differing in thisre-spect also from most eastern towns, where each quarter is regularly shut up after evening prayers. The dirt and sweepings of the houses are cast into the streets, where they add to the accumulated mass of dust or mud according to the season. Another great inconvenience, and one great cause of dirtiness and also of disease, is the scarcity of water, which is here fully as much felt as at Djidda. There are but few cisterns for collecting rain, and the well water is so brackish that it is used only for culinary purposes, except during the time of the pilgrimage, when the lowest class of the pilgrims drink it. The famous well of Zemzem in the great mosque is indeed sufficiently copious to supply the whole town, but its water is heavy to the taste and impedes digestion. The best water in Mekka is brought from a conduit in the vicinity of Arafat, about thirty miles distant. This conduit is wholly built of stone, but it is greatly neglected and has fallen into decay, so that most of the water is lost in its passage to the city through apertures, or slowly forces its way through the obstructing sediment; and hence the supply is barely sufficient in ordinary times for the use of the inhabitants, and during the pilgrimage sweet water is so scarce that a small skin pf it is often sold for thç value of a shilling, a very high price amongst the Arabs. At two places the aqueduct runs above ground, and there the water is let off into small channels and fountains, at which a toll is exacted by the slaves of the scherif for liberty to fill the water-skins; and here during the pilgrimage crowds are to be seen day and night quarelling and fighting for access to the water. When the Wahabees besieged the place they cut off this supply of water, and it was not till some time afterwards that the injury was partially repaired. There is a small spring which oozes from under the rocks behind the great palace of the scherif which affords excellent water, but it is wholly appropriated to the use ofthe scherif ’ s family. It has been already mentioned that there are few public buildings of any consequence in Mekka. The castle stands nearly on the summit of the range of mountains which enclose the town; it commands the greatest part of the city, but is itself commanded by several higher summits. The building was considerably strengthened and repaired by Ghaleb, a scherif of Mekka, who mounted it with heavy guns. It contains a large cistern and a small mosque, and might accommodate a garrison of 1000 men. It is an impregnable fortress against the attacks of Arabs, and might even offer some resistance to Europeans. The approach is by a steep and narrow path. Below the castle hill upon a small plain stands the great palace of the reigning scherif; it has high and solid walls and seems to have been intended for an out-work to the castle above it, with which, according to the reports of the Mekkawy, there is a subterranean communication. It is an irregular pile of building and comprises many spacious courts and gloomy chambers; it is now converted into a magazine of corn. The most remarkable building in Mekka is the mosque, called the Beitullah, which, however, is only remarkable on account of the Kaaba which it encloses; there being several mosques in other places of the East nearly equal to it in size, and much superior in beauty. The Kaaba is contained in an oblong square 250 paces in length, and 200 in breadth; this open square is enclosed by a quadruple row of pillars, some of white marble, granite, or porphery, but the greater part of the common stone of the Mekka mountains; these pillars are united by pointed arches, every four of which support a small dome; from the arches lamps are suspended, some of which burn every night, and the whole are regularly lighted up during the nights of Ramadan. The Kaaba is an oblong massive structure of the grey Mekka stone, eighteen paces in length, fourteen in breadth, and from thirty-five to forty feet in height; seven paved colonnades, of sufficient breadth to admit four or five persons to walk abreast, lead towards the Kaaba in the centre. At the south-east corner of the Kaaba, near the door, is the famous “blaek stone,” said to have been brought by the angel Gabriel to form the foundation of the edifice. It forms a sharp angle of the building, at four or five feet from the ground. It is an irregular oval, about seven inches in diameter, consisting of a dozen smaller stones cemented, and perfectly smoothed by the millions of touches and kisses which it has received. The grand ceremony through which the pilgrims pass, is to go seven times round the Kaaba, reciting certain appointed verses and prayers, and kissing the sacred stone. In the south-east corner of the Kaaba is another stone which the people, walking round the Kaaba, touch only with the right hand. On the north side there is a hollow in the ground lined with marble; and here it is thought meritorious to pray. The four sides of the Kaaba are covered with a black silk stuff', hanging down and leaving the roof bare. Round the\n",

      "p*iX - O⅛α, rex justitiae), the name of an individual who occupies an important place amongst the characters which appear in the Old Testament history, as typical of Christ. Very little, however, is said in Scripture regarding him personally; his name occurs only twice in tlιe Old Testament, (in Gen. xiv. 18, and in Ps. ex. 4); and the reference to him in the New, (in Heb. vii. 20. and vii. 1.), has respect only to his typical character. His name is mentioned for the first time in the sacred history, on the occasion of the return of Abraham from the defeat of the four kings or sheikhs who had invaded the district of Sodom, and carried captive his nephew Lot. In the valley of Sha-veh, or “the king ’ s dale,” probably the same valley as that mentioned under the same name in 2 Samuel (xviii. 18), the victor was met by Melchisedec, who is described as “the king of Salem,” and who, with the generous readiness of eastern hospitality, set before him and his troop “bread and wine,” that is, a plentiful repast.^[1. Patrick, in lοc. Josephus, Antiq. i. 9. ] The Salem here mentioned is not to be confounded with the Salem spoken of in Psalm lxxvi. 2, where it is plainly Jerusalem that is referred to, but must have been some city, unknown to general history, which lay somewhere between Damascus and Sodom, to which district the narrative of Moses fixes the route of Abraham’s march.^[2. See this clearly shewn by Bochart, Ρhaleg, 1. ii c. 4. ] In addition to his royal dignity he sustained also the sacerdotal office: “he was priest of the most high God and in this capacity he pronounced a benediction on Abraham. In return for his kindness, and especially from reverence to his priestly office, the patriarch gave him a tithe of all the spoil he had taken in that expedition, from which he was then returning.\n",
      "This is the sum of what Moses records respecting Melchisedec; and the only addition that can be made to the recital from the other passages above referred to is, that his priesthood was not derived from hereditary descent, but had been conferred on him by the immediate appointment of God.^[3. Heb∙ vii. 3. Fuller on Gen. xiv∙ 18. ] Meagre, however, as this account is, there is something in the character and position of the individual to whom it refers of so singular a nature, as at once to excite curiosity and stimulate further investigation. That in a land inhabited by the accursed race of Canaan, and at a time when the knowledge of the true God was confined apparently to Abraham and his dependents,^[4. Josh, xxiv. 2. ] an individual descended from that race should have been found, uniting in himself the two offices of priest and king, worshipping the true God of heaven and of earth,^[5. Gen. xiv. 19 ] and so eminent in dignity and piety, that his blessing was gratefully received by Abraham, and the divinity of his priesthood acknowledged on the part of the patriarch, by an offering to him of tithes, is a circumstance which cannot fail to excite the surprise of every reader of the sacred narrative. It is natural for him to ask, Who or what was this extraordinary character? From what race did he spring? Whence did he derive his knowledge of the true God? Or how came he to be “a king of righteousness,” and “a king of peace,” as well as a priest of God, in the land of Canaan? To these questions the narrative of Moses furnishes no reply, and what is said of him in other parts of Scripture^[6. ¢ Ps. ex 4. Heb. vi. 20. ] only tends to heighten our curiosity, by the elevated rank which is there assigned to him, as a type of the Messiah. Our only resource in such a case is probable conjecture, and to this it is not surprising that expositors of the Scriptures, both in ancient and modern times, should have had recourse; nor is it to be wondered at that the opinions which they have advocated on the subject have been both numerous and discordant. To recapitulate the whole of these would only be to occupy space which might be far more usefully filled; we shall, therefore, confine ourselves to a statement of one or two of the most prominent, with a brief view of the arguments by which they have been enforced.\n",
      "1. By the Jewish expositors generally, Melchisedec is said to have been Shem, the son of Noah, and this, as we learn from Epiphanius, (Haeres, lv. p. 205), was also the opinion entertained by the Samaritans. It has likewise been held by a few Christian interpreters, amongst whom is Luther. The passages from Jewish writers advocating it, have been carefully collected by Bochart, (Phaleg. lib. ii. c. 1), who has also very satisfactorily shewn its absurdity; apart from the decisive evidence furnished against it by the statement of Paul, that Melchisedec was one whose descent could not be identified with that of the Levites, (μὴ γεvε α λ o γ o ύ μ ε vo ς ἐ ξ ὐ υτωv, Heb. vii. 5), a statement which is not true of Shein, who was in the regular line of Levi’s progenitors. It seems highly unreasonable that Moses, who often mentions Shem, should here introduce him under another name, without giving any explanation as to the person really intended; nor is it easily conceivable that Abraham should have been described as “sojourning in g strange country,” if he had been in the immediate vicinity of his ancestor Shem. The Jews, moreover, are not unanimous in this opinion, for Josephus tells us that Melchisedec was a prince of the Canaanites;^[7. Xavavalωv δυνάστης. De bell Jud. vii. 18. ] and in one place of the rabbinical book Sohar,^[8. Lech· lécha, fol. 60, col. 237, ed. Sulz., quoted in Professor Tholuck’s Comment, zιιm briefe an d. Heb- in loc. ] he is spoken of as a type of the king of true. peace.\n",
      "2. Augustin and Theodoret severally inform us of a class of heretics in the early church, who received the name of Melchisedechians, from their holding the opinion that Melchisedec was a mighty divine power, ( dei virtutem, μeγαληv τιvα καί βtιav δυνάμιν), superior to Christ, and the model after which Christ was formed. The founder of this sect was one Theodotus, an usurer, who seems to have flourished about the year 174.^[9. Theodoret, Haer.fab. lib. iĭ. cap. 6. ap. Suicer. Thes. Ecd∙ ] An advance upon this opinion was made by Hierax, who, as we learn from Epiphanius, identified this divine power with the Holy Spirit. (Haer. lv. p. 304). The sect seems to have commanded little attention, and their opinion is worthy of notice only as forming one of the heresies of the early church.\n",
      "3. By some of the fathers, and not a few of the more modern expositors, Melchisedec has been regarded as the Logos or second person of the Trinity, who appeared to Abraham, not incarnate, but only, as Epiphanius expresses it, ' ε v ἰ δ έ α ἀ νθρώπου, in the model of man. In defence of this opinion, its advocates adduce, 1st, the acknowledged fact that such appearances were vouchsafed to the patriarchs, as in the case of Abraham, when “the Lord” communed with him respecting the destruction of Sodom, and of Jacob, when he wrestled with the angel, and saw “ God face to face ;” 2dly, the evident mystery attached in Scripture to the person and character of Melchisedec, “of whom,” says Paul, “we have many things to say and hard to be uttered ;”^[10. Heb. v. 11. ] 3dly, the assertion of the same apostle that Melchisedec was not mortal, implied in his declaration, that'whilst other men who receive tithes die, “it is witnessed of him that he liveth ;”^[11. Heb. vii. 8. ] n 4thly, the strong and unqualified terms in which the unearthly origin of the “order” of his priesthood, and its perpetual duration, are spoken of by the same apostle, as well as by the psalmist;^[12. Heb. vii. 3, &c. Ps. ex. 4. ] 5tbly, the language of Paul in regard to the mysterious existence of Melchisedec, as “without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life,” language strikingly applicable to Christ, “whose goings forth have been of old from everlasting,” but hardly tobe understood of a mere man; and, finally, the circumstance of Melchisedec’s receiving tithes as a free-will offering from Abraham, an homage which was rendered by the pious to none but the Almighty. On the side of this theory are ranked some eminent names both in the early and in the modern church. It is enough to mention those of Ambrose, Damianus, Moulin, Cunaeus, Outrein, Hottinger, Starke, Gaillard, Ridgley, Hunter, Henry, and Brown. A very able defence of this opinion has recently appeared in a work entitled, Melchizedek, by the author of Balaam, Elijah, &c. London, 1834, the production, we believe, of a lady.\n",
      "4. By far the most common opinion is, that Melchisedec was a righteous and powerful king, a worshipper and priest of the Most High God, in the land of Canaan, and a type of Jesus Christ. In support of this opinion it is contended,-1st, that the mysterious character attributed to Melchisedec in Scripture, is nothing more than belongs to all the prophetical types; and that when Paul says he has many things to say respecting him which are hard to be uttered, he only means that owing to the carnality of those to whom he was writing, the revelation which he was about to give of the spiritual character of Melchisedec as a type of Christ, would not be easily apprehended;^[13. The word he uses is δυσ ε ρ μ ὴ v ε υτo ς which the Vulgate renders ininterpretabilis. ] 2dly, that his being described as ἀ πατωρ κaι ἀ μ ὴτ ωp, implies nothing more than that his descent was not matter of record, in the same way as Sarah is called ἀ μ ὴτ ωp by Philo, because her mother’s name is not known, or as Servius Tullius is said by Livy to have been born patre nullo, matre serva, because only his mother’s name (Cornicula) was matter of history; 3dly, that what is said of his being “without beginning of days or end of life,” refers merely to our ignorance of the time and manner of his birth and of his death, which are purposely left unrecorded in order that he might serve as a type of Christ “who ever livet\n",

      "----\n",
      "whose name is familiarly known to the readers of Scotish history, was born in the year 1535. He was the third son of Sir John Melville of Raith in Fifeshire, by his wife Helen, the eldest daughter of Sir Alexander Napier of Merchiston. At an early period the father declared his adherence to the reformed doctrines, and thus incurred the unrelenting hatred of an unholy priesthood. He was accused of heresy by Archbishop Beaton, but upon this occasion was protected by the interposition of the king. When the war with England ensued during the minority of the queen, all intercourse with that country was prohibited under heavy penalties. His eldest son lιaving been sent thither for his education, Sir John addressed to him a letter which was intercepted, and which, although so harmless in its tendency, was converted by Archbishop Hamilton into the instrument of his destruction: he was arrested at the instigation of this prelate, and having been sent under a strong guard to Stirling, was convicted of high treason, and brought to the scaffold. Not satisfied with this atrocious act, the archbishop found means to obtain possession of his estate, and thus to reduce his widow and children to a state of penury. “But,” as we are informed, “the Almighty ordered matters so, that all the younger children were better provided for than they could have been by their father if he had been alive, as Sir John himself had foretold his lady to comfort her.”^[10. Wood’s Peerage of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 112. ] At the period of this judicial murder, his third son had attained the age of fourteen. Jean de Monluc, bishop of Valence, had visited the Scotish court in the capacity of an ambassador; and on his return to his own country, the queen regent took that opportunity of sending young Melville to be placed in her daughter’s service as a page of honour. The bishop did not however proceed directly to France: he had received instructions to visit Ireland, for the purpose of communicating with O’Neill, O’Docherty, and other disaffected chieftains, who had offered to transfer their allegiance to the French king. He embarked at Irvine in the month of January 1550, and, after a tedious and dangerous passage, at length reached Lochfoyle. O’Docherty conducted Monluc with his attendants to his own residence, a large and dark tower, where, as it was now the season of Lent, they were regaled with such cold cheer as herrings and biscuit. The bishop having discovered a too amorous partiality for the chieftain’s daughter, two English friars, who were living in exile, devised a method for saving the honour of the O’Dochertys, and ministering to the wants of so exemplary a prelate.^[11. “The said freres persaving the bischop to mak a compt of Odocartis dochter, wha fled him continowally, they brocht to him a woman that spak Englis to ly with him; whilk harlet being keped quyetly in his chamber, fand a little glass within a kaice standing in a window, for the coffers wer all wet be the sea wallis that fell in the schip during the storm. Bot sehe beleuit it had bene ordonit to eat, because it had ane odoriphant smell, therefore sehe lickit it clean out; quhilk put the bischop in sic a rage that he cryed out for impatience, and dis-couerit his harlettrie and his colair in sic sort as the freris fled and the woman folowed. Bot the Yrisch men and his auen saruandis leuch at the matter, for it was a phioll of the only maist precious balm that grew in Egipt, whilk Solyman the Gret Turc had geucn in a present to the said bischop efter he had bene twa yeares ambassadeur for the K. of France in Turky, and was esteamed worth twa thowsand crownis.” (Melville’s Memoirs, p. 10.) ] The damsel herself, who had shunned his addresses, viewed Melville with more favourable eyes: she sought him wherever he was to be found, and having brought a priest who could speak English, she offered to marry him, and to accompany him wherever he pleased; but he thought it expedient to decline the honour thus intended for him, on the plea that he was too young, and “had no rents.” After remaining for several weeks in Ireland, they returned to Scotland, and havingagain embarked, they sailed from Dumbarton, and landed at a port in Bretagne. Monluc posted to Paris, and left the Scotish page to follow at a more leisurely pace. Having met with some adventures by the way, he reached his place of destination in the month of April. The bishop was soon afterwards despatched to Rome, and left him at Paris, to learn to play on the lute, and to write French; and to these acquirements he added the elements of mathematics. Before he was presented to the queen, a curious incident brought him under the notice of the great constable Montmorenci, who must evidently have been much pleased with his appearance, for he instantly proposed to receive him into his own service. Having previously obtained the bishop’s consent, he accordingly entered into this service in May 1553.\n",
      "War was now raging betweeft the king of France and the emperor of Germany, and Melville was speedily called to attend the constable in his campaigns in France and Flanders. The kindness of ms patron procured him a pension from the king in the year 1554. In 1557 he bore arms at the battle of St. Quentin, where the constable’s army was totally defeated, and he was himself wounded’and taken prisoner. Melville was wounded in the head by the stroke of a mace, and as he was unhorsed and lost his helmet, he was exposed to no small jeopardy; but his servant remounted him upon a Scotish gelding, which carried him beyond the reach of his assailants. Having proceeded to La Ferre, he there met his friend Henry Killigrew, who held his horse till he went into a barber’s shop to have his wound dressed. He attended the constable during his captivity; from which he was delivered by the treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, concluded in the year 1559∙ In the course of the same year, the king, at Montmorenci’s suggestion, sent him on a secret mission to Scotland, where, under the pretext of paying a visit to his relations, he was instructed to use his best endeavours for ascertaining the real views of the prior of St. Andrews and his adherents. Having travelled through England, he found the queen regent residing in the old tower of Falkland, waiting the issue of an expected engagement between her forces and those raised by the lords of the congregation. He easily ascertained that there was no reason for suspecting the prior of a design to usurp the crown. A melancholy change of affairs awaited his return to France: the constable had the singular infelicity to kill his sovereign Henry the Second in a tournament, and had been commanded to withdraw from court; so that he no longer retained the same power of rewarding or advancing his dependants. This circumstance he regretted with tears in his eyes. Melville, although received with the greatest kindness, judged it expedient to try his fortune in another country, and he now directed his views towards Germany. To the Elector Palatine, he was furnished with letters of recommendation by his patron, as well as by another nobleman. He experienced a gracious reception, and made such progress in the elector’s favour, that in 1560, on the death of Francis the Second, he was charged with a message of condolence to the court of France. When he had executed this commission, the queen mother dismissed him with many thanks, and with a fair reward amounting to the value of a thousand crowns. His residence in Germany afforded him an opportunity of learning the language of that country; an acquisition which he must have found of some advantage to a diplomatist. In company with the elector’s second son Casimir, he visited France during the following year; and he there made a tender of his services to Queen Mary, who was on the eve of returning to Scotland. She received him very graciously, and urged him, “when he wes to retire him out of Germany, to com hame and serue hir Maieste, with frendly and fauorable offers.”\n",
      "The cardinal of Lorraine had projected a marriage between Mary and the archduke Charles of Austria, the youngest son of the emperor Ferdinand. In 1562 Melville received a letter from secretary Maitland, instructing him, by the queen’s command, to procure and transmit particular information respecting the person, character, religion, and revenues of this prince. The kindness of his master the elector speedily enabled him to execute his commission. With the emperor’s eldest son Maximilian, then king of the Romans, he had various interviews; and was at no loss to discover that he had no inclination to promote his brother’s elevation to a throne. The king offered to retain him in his own service; but he had now formed the resolution of returning to his native country, after he had extended his travels to Italy. He accordingly proceeded to Venice and Rome, and, after an interval of about two months, returned through Switzerland to Heidelberg. The elector soon afterwards employed him in a diplomatic mission to Paris; where he found the constable again frequenting the court, but without having recovered the influence which he once possessed. It is another proof of Melville’s courtier-like address, that the queen mother offered to make him a gentleman of the king’s chamber, “prouydit with ane honorable pension, and to be aduancit till offices and honnours as geue he wer a Frencheman born; and that sehe wald employ him not only in Germany, bot also in England and Flanders.” But about this crisis he received communications from Moray and Maitland, requiring him, in the name of their royal mistress, to return home for the purpose of being employed in some affairs of consequence. Having once more repaired to Heidelberg, he took leave of the Elector Palatine; who finally entrusted him with a commission to the queen of England, partly relating to an alliance with the protestant princes of Germany, and partly to a scheme of offering her the \n",

      "an instrument for drawing in perspective; one of the many ingenious inventions of Dr Wollaston.\n",
      "If a piece of plain glass be fixed at an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizon, and if, at some distance beneath, there be a sheet of paper laid horizontally on a table, a person looking downwards through the glass will sce an image of the objects situated before him; and as the glass which reflects the image is also transparent, the paper and pencil can be seen at the same time with the image, so that the outline of the image may be traced on the paper. The image is an inverted one. This is the simplest form of the instrument, and may be constructed extemporaneously by fixing on a stand a plain transparent glass, with its surfaces ground parallel, or a piece of Muscovy glass, at an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizon; a card with a small hole in it will serve as a sight for keeping the eye steady in one situation whilst the pencil is traeing the image.\n",
      "If there be a plain mirror at an angle of 22∣ degrees with the horizon, and a piece of plain transparent glass be placed near it, at an angle of 22∣ degrees with the vertical, the rays from the object will be twice reflected before they reach the eye; and consequently, on looking down through the transparent glass, an erect image is seen, and the peneil may be drawn over the outlines of this image so as to leave a perspective representation on the paper. This disposition is seen at fig 1, Plate CXLIV., where hc is the mirror, ah the transparent plain glass.\n",
      "As the image and pencil are at different distances, they cannot be both seen in the same state of the eye. To remedy this, inconvenience, a convex glass is used, of such focus as to require no more effort than is necessary for seeing the distant objects distinctly. By means of this lens, the image will appear as if it were placed on the surface of the paper. In fig. 1 hd is a convex glass of twelve inches focus; at c the eye is placed; fghe is the course of the rays proceeding from the object to the eye.\n",
      "Those whose eyes are adapted to seeing near objects alone, will not derive advantage from the use of a convex glass, but will require a concave glass to be placed at f, in the course of the rays from the object to the reflecting surface. In fig. 2, ih is a concave glass placed in the above-mentioned situation: it is so disposed as to be turned at pleasure into its place, as the sight of the observer may require. Persons whose sight is nearly perfect may use either the concave glass placed before the reflecting surface, or the convex glass placed between the paper and the eye.\n",
      "in the actual construction of the instrument, a prism is used instead of a mirror and a plain glass. The rays from the object fall upon the surface hc of the prism, fig. 3. This surface hc is inclined 22⅜ degrees to the horizon. The refractive power of the glass allows none of the rays in this situation to pass out; they are all reflected from the surface hc to the surface ah, and from that to the eye. ah makes an angle of 135 degrees with hc, and 221 degrees with the vertical. The eye cannot see the pencil through the prism as it does through a plain glass; therefore, in order that the pencil may be seen, the eye must be so placed that only a part of the pupil may be above the edge of the prism, as at e, fig. 3; and then the reflected image will be seen at the same time with the paper and pencil. There is a small piece of brass perforated with a lwle c, and moving on a ecntre, fig. 2; this serves to keep the eye in onc position, as it must be, that the image may be steady, and also to regulate the relative quantities of light to be received from the object and from the paper.\n",
      "The instrument,\" being near the eye, does not require to be large. The smallest size which can be executed with accuracy is to be preferred, and is such that the lens is only three fourths of an inch in diameter. Fig 4 shows the instrument on its stand, and clamped to a board. The joint by which the prism is attached to the stand is double. The whole instrument packs in a box eight inches by two, and half an inch deep.\n",
      "This instrument serves for drawing objects of all forms, and consequently also for copying lines already drawn on a plain surface. If it is required that the copy shall be of the same size as the original drawing, the distance of the drawing from the prism should be the same as the distance of the paper from the eye-hole. No lens will be necessary in this ease, because the image and the paper, being both at the same distance from the eye, coincide without the aid of a glass.\n",
      "In order to have a redueed copy of a drawing, the drawing is to be placed at a distance from the prism greater than the distance of the paper from the eye-hole. If the distance is twice as great, a copy will be obtained in which the lines are of one half the size of the lines in the original, and so in proportion for other distances. A lens is necessary, that the eye may be enabled to see at two different distances; and, in order that one lens may serve, the distance between the eye-hole and the paper should be variable; to that effect the stand is susceptible of being lengthened or shortened at pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The length of the stem is adjusted upon optical principles. When a distant object is to be delineated, the rays coming from it, and reflected by the instrument to the eye, are parallel, and it is required that the rays proceeding from the paper to the eye should also be parallel. This is accomplished by interposing a lens between the paper and the eye, with its principal focus on the paper. When the object to be delineated is so near that the rays which come from it to the eye are divergent, then it is required that the rays from the paper should likewise be divergent in the same degree, in order that the paper and the image may both be seen distinctly by the same eye; for this purpose the lens must be placed at a distance from the paper less than the distance of its principal focus. The stem of the instrument is marked at certain distances, to which the conjugate foci are in the several proportions of 2, 3, 4, &c. to I, so that distinct vision may be obtained in all cases by placing the original drawing more distant.\n",
      "If the convex lcns be transposed to the front of the prism, and the proportional distances bc reversed, a magnified image of the object will be obtained.\n",
      "This instrument has deservedly come into use. Its advantages, when compared with tĥc camera obscura, are, ist, That it is small and easily carried about, t 2dly, That no lines are distorted, not even those most remote from the centre; whereas, in the camera obscura, the lines which are not near the centre of the field are more or less distorted. ⅛dly, In the field of the camera lucida 70 or 80 degrees may be included, whilst the distinct field of the camera obscura does not extend beyond 30 or 35 degrees at most. The specification of Dr Wollaston’s patent for the camera lucida is inserted in the Repertory of Arts, vol. X. 1807, p. 162, and his description of the instrument in Nicholson’s Journal, vol. xvii.\n",
      "The camera lucida employed by Captain Hall packs in a small box. When the instrument is to be used the box folds out and forms a small table, which is fixed on the top of a tripod. There is a folding three-legged seat, which packs within the tripod. The tripod, when closed and containing the seat, is only the size of a walking stick.\n",
      "If the camera lucida be fixed at the eye-glass of a telescope, it will reflect to the eye the image of the objects in the field of the telescope, so that a drawing of the image may be made. See Dr Brewster’s Account of some Philosophical Instruments. A plain reflecting glass, fixed at an angle of 45 degrees with the horizon, and placed so as to receive the rays from the eye-glass of a telescope, will also give an image of the objects in the field, so situated that the image may be traced with a pencil. Varley’s patent graphic telescope is upon this principle. In order that the field may be large, the magnifying power of the telescope should be small.\n",
      "• The inherent qualities of all the instruments for drawing in perspective being closely allied, it will be proper to say something of the principles on which these instruments are formed, and to mention some that are not described in other parts of this work.\n",
      "To make a perspective drawing of an object is to lay down on paper a section of the perspective cone, whose apex is at the eye, and whose base is the object. An experienced draughtsman can draw the figure of this section without the aid of instruments. Others who have not acquired the facility of drawing the image they see, must have recourse either to measurement, or to instruments which bring the image under the pencil.\n",
      "Drawing by measurement is performed by actually measuring the height of the principal parts of the object, and their horizontal distance from the eye; together with the distance of the paper from the eye; and from these dimensions the drawing is constructed by the systematic rules of perspective.\n",
      "Another mode of obtaining a drawing by measurement is to measure the angles at the eye. Suited to this purpose are theodolites, astronomical quadrants, or other instruments capable of measuring vertical and azimuthal angles at the eye. ∙ The angles to be measured are, the angles of altitude, and the angles of azimuth, between the point of sight and the principal points of the object; and if the tangents of the azimuthal angles be laid down with a radius equal to the distance of the paper from the eye, and the tangents of the angles of altitude with a radius equal to the distance of the paper multiplied by the secant of the azimuth, the situation of the principal points of the drawing will be determined. Or, if the instrument is capable of measuring angles in any plane, the angles between the principal points of the object and the point of sight are to be ob\n",

      "the most illustrious of the Portuguese poets, was born at Lisbon in 1517. His family was of considerable note, and originally Spanish. In 1370 Vasco Perez dc Camoens, disgusted at the court of Castile, fled to that of Lisbon, where King Ferdinand immediately admitted him into his council, and gave him the lordships of Sardoal, Punhete, Marano, Amendo, and other lands of considerable extent, a certain proof of the eminence of his rank and abilities. In the war of the succession, which broke out on the death of Ferdinand, Ca-mocns sided with the king of Castile, and was killed in the battle of Λljabarota. But though John I. the victor, seized a great part of his estate, his widow, the daughter of Gonzalo Tereyro, grand master of the order of Christ, and general of the Portuguese army, was not reduced beneath her rank. She had three sons who took the name of Camoens. The family of the eldest intermarried with the first nobility of Portugal, and even, according to Cas-tera, with the blood royal; but the family of the second brother, whose fortune was slender, had the superior honour of producing the author of the Lusiad.\n",
      "The misfortunes of our poet commenced early in life. In his infancy, Simon Vaz de Camoens, his father, commander of a vessel, was shipwrecked at Goa, where he perished, together with the greater part of his fortune. His mother, however, Anne de Macedo of Santarem, provided for the education of her son Louis at the university of Coimbra, where he acquired an intimacy with the classics, equal to that of a Scaliger, but directed by the tastc of a Milton or a Pope. When he left the university he appeared at court. He was handsome, with expressive eyes and a fine complexion; and as he was a polished scholar, this, added to the natural ardour and vivacity of bis disposition, rendered him an accomplished gentleman. Courts are the usual scenes of intrigue; and intrigue was then fashionable at Lisbon. But the particulars of the amours of Camoens remain unknown. It only appears that he had aspired above his rank, and was in consequence banished from the court; and in several of his sonnets he ascribes his misfortunes to love.\n",
      "He now retired to his mother’s friends at Santarcm, where he renewed his studies, and began his poem on the discovery of India. But as John III. was at this time preparing an armament against Africa, Camoens, tired of an inactive and obscure life, went to Ceuta with the expedition, and greatly distinguished himself by his valour in several encounters. In a naval engagement with the Moors in the Straits of Gibraltar, he was among the foremost to board, and lost his right eye in the conflict. Yet neither the hurry of actual service, nor the dissipation of a camp, could stifle his genius. He continued his Lusiadas, and several of his most beautiful sonnets were written in Africa, while, as he expressed it, “one hand the pen, and one the sword employed.” The fame of his valour had now reached the court, and he obtained permission to return to Lisbon. But whilst he solicited an establishment which he had merited in the ranks of battle, the malignity of evil tongues, as he expresses it in one of his letters, was poured out upon him. Though the bloom of his early youth was effaced by several years’ residence under the scorching sun of Africa, and though altered by the loss of an eye, his presence gave uneasiness to the gentlemen of some families of the first rank where he had formerly visited; and Camoens now found it prudent to banish himself from his native country. Accordingly, in 1553, he sailed for India, with a resolution never to return. As the ship left the Tagus, he exclaimed, in the words of the sepulchral monument of Scipio Africanus, Ingrata patria, non possidebis ossa mea ; “ungrateful country, thou shalt not possess my bones.” But he knew not what evils in the East would awaken the remembrance of his native land.\n",
      "λVhcn Camoens arrived in India, an expedition was ready to sail, to avenge the king of Cochin on the king of Pimenta. Without allowing himself any rest on shore after his long voyage, he joined this armament, and in the conquest of the Alagada islands displayed his usual bravery. In the following year Camoens attended Manuel de Vasconccllo in an expedition to the Red Sea, where, as he had no use for his sword, he cmploycd his pen, and also visited Mount Felix and the adjacent part of Africa, which he so strongly pictures in the Lusiad, and in one of his little pieces where he laments the absence of his mistress. λVhen he returned to Goa he enjoyed a tranquillity which enabled him to bestow attention on his epic; but this serenity was interrupted by his own imprudence; for he wrote some satires which gave offence, and, by order of the viceroy, Francisco Barreto, he was banished to China.\n",
      "But the accomplishments and manners of Camoens soon found him friends, though under the disgrace of banishment. He was appointed commissary in the island of Macao, a Portuguese settlement in the bay of Canton, where bc continued his Lusiad; and, after five years residence, he acquired a fortune, though small, yet equal to his wishes. Dom Constantine de Braganza was now viceroy of India; and Camoens, desirous to return to Goa, resigned his charge, and set sail in a ship freighted by himself; but he was shipwrecked in the gulf near the mouth of the river Mecon, on the coast of China, and all he had acquired perished in the waves. His poems, which he held in one hand, while he swam with the other, were all he found himself possessed of when he stood friendless on an unknown shore.\n",
      "On the banks of the Mccon he wrote his beautiful paraphrase of the psalm, Super flumina Eabylonis, where the Jews, in the finest strain of poetry, are represented as hanging their harps on the willows, by the rivers of Babylon, and lamenting their exile from their native land. Here Camoens continued some time, till an opportunity offered of a passage to Goa. When he arrived at that city, Dorn Constantine de Braganza, the viceroy, admitted him to his friendship, and Camoens continued happy till Count Redondo assumed the government. While Constantine continued in power, those who bad formerly procured the banishment of the satirist were silent; but now they exerted all their arts against him. Redondo, when he entered upon office, however, pretended to be the friend of  Camoens; yet, with unfeeling indifference, he suffered the innocent man to be thrown into the common prison. But after much delay in bringing forward witnesses, Camoens, in a public trial, fully refuted every accusation directed against his conduct while commissary at Macao, and his enemies were loaded with ignominy and reproach. Camoens, however, had some creditors, and they detained him in prison a considerable time, till the gentlemen of Goa becoming ashamed that a man of his singular merit should experience such treatment among them, he was set at liberty, again assumed the profession of arms, and received the allowance of a gentleman volunteer, a character at this time common in Portuguese India. Soon afterwards, Pedro Barreto, appointed governor of the fort at Sofala, allured the poet by high promises to attend him thither. The governor of a distant fort, in a barbarous country, shares in some measure the fate of an exile; yet, though the only motive of Barreto was to enjoy the conversation of Camoens at his table, he took no care to render the life of his guest agreeable. Chagrined with his treatment, and weary of a state of dependence, Camoens resolved to return to his native country. A ship, on the homeward voyage, at this time touched at Sofala, and several gentlemen on board were desirous that Camoens should accompany them; but this the governor ungenerously endeavoured to prevent, and charged him with a debt for board. Anthony de Cabra, however, and Hector de Sylvcira, paid the demand; and Camoens and the hb-nour of Barreto were discharged together.\n",
      "After an absence of sixteen years, Camoens in 1569 returned to Lisbon, unhappy even in his restoration to his native country, for the pestilence then raged in the capital, and prevented his publication for three years. At last, in 1572, he printed his Lusiad, which, in the opening of the first book, he addressed to King Sebastian, then in his eighteenth year, wdιo was so pleased with its merit, that he gave the author a pension of four thousand reals, on condition that he should reside at court; but this salary seems to have been withdrawn by Cardinal Henry, who succeeded to the crown of Portugal, which Sebastian lost at the battle of Alcaçar in Africa.\n",
      "Henry, though the patron of one species of literature, utterly neglected the author of the Lusiad; and under his inglorious reign Camoens died in all the misery of poverty, and, according to some, in an alms-house. It appears, however, that he had not even that certainty of subsistence which such houses usually provide. He had a black servant, who had grown old with him, and had long experienced his master’s humanity. This grateful Indian, a native of Java, who, according to some, had saved his master’s life in the unhappy shipwreck where he lost his effects, begged in the streets of Lisbon for the only man in Portugal on whom God had bestowed those talents which had a tendency to elevate the spirit of a declining age. To the eye of a faithful observer, the fate of Camoens throws great light on that of his country, and will appear strictly connected with it. The same ignorance, and the same degenerate spirit, which suffered Camoens to depend on his share of the alms begged in the streets by his aged servant, sunk the kingdom of Portugal into the most abject vassalage ever experienced by a conquered nation. But while the grandees of Portugal were blind to the ruin which impended over them, Camoens beheld it with a pungency of grief which hastened his end. In one of his letters he has these remarkable words: “I am ending the course of my life; th\n",

      "a substance produced from the syringe tree of Cayenne and other parts of South America, and possessed of singular properties. No substance is yet known which is so pliable, and at the same time so elastic; and it is further a matter of curiosity, as being capable of resisting the action of very powerful menstrua. From the account of M. de la Condamine, we learn that this substance oozes out, under the form of a vegetable milk, from incisions made in the tree; and that it is gathered chiefly in time of rain, because, though it maybe collected at all times, it then flows most abundantly. The means employed to inspissate and indurate it, M. de Laborde says, are kept a profound secret. M. Bomare and others affirm that it thickens and hardens gradually by being exposed to the air; and that as soon as it acquires a solid consistence it manifests a very extraordinary degree of flexibility and elasticity. Accordingly the Indians make boots of it which water cannot penetrate, and which, when smoked, have the appearance of real leather. Bottles are also made of it, to the necks of which are fastened hollow reeds, so that the liquor contained in them may be squirted through the reeds or pipes by pressure. One of these filled with water is always presented to each of the guests at their entertainments, who never fails to make use of it before eating. This whimsical custom led the Portuguese in that country to call the tree that produced the resin pao di xiτrin-ga ; and hence the name of seringat is given both to the tree and to its resinous production. There are likewise made of this resin, flambeaux, an inch and a half in diameter, and two feet long, which give a beautiful light, have no bad smell, and burn twelve hours. A kind of cloth is also prepared from it, which the inhabitants of Quito apply to the same purpose as our oil-cloth and sailcloth. Lastly, it is formed, by means of moulds, into a variety of figures for use or ornament. The process is said to be this: The juice, which is obtained by incision, is spread over pieces of clay formed into the desired shape; and as fast as one layer is dry, another is added, till the vessel be of the proper thickness. The whole is then held over a strong smoke of vegetables on fire, by which means it hardens into the texture and appearance of leather; and before the finishing, while yet soft, is capable of receiving any impression, which remains for ever afterwards. When the whole is finished, the inside mould is picked out.\n",
      "Since this resin has been known in Europe, its chemical qualities and other interesting properties have been very diligently investigated. In particular, chemists have endeavoured to discover some method of dissolving it in such a manner that it would assume different figures, with equal ease as when in its original fluid state. In the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1768, we have an account of several attempts of this kind, with information how the object desired may be effected. The state of vegetable milk in which the caoutchouc resin is found when it comes from the tree, led M. Macquer to imagine that it was composed of an oil and a watery matter. From its wanting aromatic flavour, from its having little volatility, and from its being incapable of solution in spirits of wine, he concluded that the oil which entered into its composition was not an essential, but a fatty one. Hence he thought it probable that it passed from a fluid to a solid form by the evaporation of the watery part, and that the oily solvents would reduce it to a soft state. ' , Γhe first trials he made for dissolving it were with linseed oil, essence of turpentine, and several others. But all he could obtain by means of these menstrua was a viscid substance, incapable of being hardened, and totally void of elasticity. The rectified essential oil of turpentine was employed, apparently with greater success. To separate from this menstruum the caoutchouc which it had dissolved, M. Macquer added spirits of wine; but the consequence was, that part only of the oil united with the spirit, whilst the rest remained obstinately attached to the resin which it had dissolved, and thus prevented it from assuming a solid consistence. The author next endeavoured to dissolve it by means of heat in Papin’s digester. But neither water nor spirits of vvine, although in this way capable of dissolving the hardest bones, could produce any other effect upon it than to render it more firm than before. After this he tried what effect the milky juice of other vegetables would produce upon it. He used several kinds, particularly that of the fig; but in this way he could obtain no solution. From the great volatility of ether, he was next induced to try it as a menstruum; and accordingly he prepared some with great attention. The caoutchouc, cut into little bits, and put into a proper vessel with as much ether as was sufficient to cover it, was perfectly dissolved without any other heat than that of the atmosphere. This solution was transparent and of an amber colour. It still preserved the smell of ether, but mixed with the disagreeable odour of the caoutchouc, and was a little less fluid than pure ether. Upon its being thrown into water, no milky liquor was produced; but there arose to the surface a solid membrane, which possessed the elasticity and other peculiar properties of the caoutchouc. He observes, however, that two pints of the best ether, obtained by rectifying eight or ten pints of the common ether by a gentle heat, must be used, in order to insure the success of the operation. The distinguishing properties of this substance, its solidity, flexibility, and elasticity, and its quality of resisting the action of aqueous, spirituous, saline, oily, and other common solvents, render it extremely fit for the construction of tubes, catheters, and other instruments in which these properties are wanted. In order to form this resin into small tubes, M. Macquer prepared a solid cylindrical mould of wax, of the desired size and shape; and then dipping a pencil into the ethereal solution of the resin, daubed the mould with it, till he had covered it over with a coat of resin of a sufficient thickness. The whole piece was then thrown into boiling water, by the heat of which the wax was soon melted, and rose to the surface, leaving the resinous tube completely formed behind.\n",
      "Grossart informs us that he succeeded very well in employing the essential oils of turpentine and lavender as a solvent for the elastic gum, and thus forming it into tubes, or giving it any shape that was wanted. When the elastic tube is prepared with oil of lavender, the latter may be separated by immersing the tube in alcohol, which charges itself with oil, and becomes a good lavender water. Alcohol serves another purpose besides taking up the essential oil. It accelerates very much the drying of caoutchouc instruments which are thus formed. Oil of turpentine appeared always to have a kind of stickiness; and the smell, which could not be got rid of by any means yet discovered, was another inconvenience.\n",
      "Grossart proposes another solvent, which is easily procured, and is not liable to the inconvenience just mentioned. This solvent is water. “I conceive,” says he, “it will appear strange to mention water as a solvent of elastic gum, that liquid having been always supposed to have no action upon it. I myself resisted the idea; but reflecting that ether, by being saturated with water, is the better enabled to act on caoutchouc, and that this gum, when plunged into boiling water, becomes more transparent at the edges, I presumed that this effect was not due simply to the dilatation of its volume by the heat. I thought that at that temperature some action might take place, and that a long-continued ebullition might produce more sensible effects. I was not disappointed in my expectations, and one of those tubes was prepared without any other solvent than water and heat. I proceeded in the same manner as with ether. The elastic gum dilates but very little in boiling water; it becomes whitish, but recovers its colour again by drying it in the air and light. It is sufficiently prepared for use when it has been a quarter of an hour in boiling water: by this time its edges are somewhat transparent. It is to be turned spirally round the mould, in the manner wc described before, and replunged frequently into the boiling water during the time that is employed in forming the tube, to the end that the edges may be disposed to unite together. When the whole is bound with packthread, it is to be kept some hours in boiling water; after which it is to be dried, still keeping on the binding.\n",
      "“If we wish to be more certain that the connection is perfect, the spiral may be doubled; but we must always avoid placing the exterior surfaces of the slips one upon the other, as those surfaces are the parts which most resist the action of solvents. This precaution is less necessary when ether is employed, on account of its great action upon the caoutchouc.\n",
      "“It might be feared that the action of water upon caoutchouc would deprive us of the advantages which might otherwise be expected; but these fears will be removed if we consider that the affinities differ according to the temperatures; that it is only at a very high temperature that water exercises any sensible action upon caoutchouc. I can affirm that at 120 degrees of Reaumur’s thermometer (302 degrees of Fahrenheit) this affinity is not such as that the water can give a liquid form to caoutchouc; and it does not appear that we have any thing to fear in practice from a combination between these two bodies, which, though it really is a true solution, does not take place in any sensible degree but at a high temperature. It is therefore at present easy to make of caoutchouc whatever instruments it maybe advantageous to have of a flexible, supple, and elastic substance, which is impermeable to water at the temperatu\n",

      "an ancient kingdom of Asia, comprehending all the country which lies between Mount Taurus and the Euxine Sea. It was divided by the Persians into two satrapies or governments; by the Macedonians into two kingdoms, the one called Cappadocia ad Taurum ; the other Cappadocia ad Pontum, and commonly Pontus ; for the description and history of which last, see the article Pontus. Cappadocia Magna, or Cappadocia properly so called, was bounded by Pontus on the north, Lycaonia and part of Armenia Major on the south, Galatia on the west, and by the Euphrates and part of Armenia Minor on the east. The first king of Cappadocia we read of in history was Pharnaces, who was preferred to the crown by Cyrus, king of Persia, who gave him his sister Atossa in marriage. This is all we find recorded of him, except that he was killed in a war with the Hyrcanians. After him came a succession of eight kings, of whom we know scarce any thing except that they continued faithful to the Persian interest. In the time of Alexander the Great, Cappadocia was governed by Ariarathes II. who, notwithstanding the vast conquests and fame of the Macedonian monarchy, continued unshaken in his fidelity to the Persians. Alexander was prevented by death from invading his dominions; but Perdiccas, marching against him with a powerful and well-disciplined army, dispersed his forces, and having taken Ariarathes himself prisoner, crucified him, with all those of the royal blood whom he could get into his power. Diodorus tells us that he was killed in the battle. He is said to have reigned eighty-two years. His son Ariarathes III. having escaped the general slaughter of the royal family, fled into Armenia, where he lay concealed till the civil dissensions which rose among the Macedonians gave him a fair opportunity of recovering his paternal kingdom. Amyntas, at that time the governor of Cappadocia, opposed him; but being defeated in a pitched battle, the Macedonians were obliged to abandon all the strongholds. Ariarathes, after a long and peaceable reign, left his kingdom to his son Ariaramnes II. He applied himself more to the arts of peace than war, in consequence of which Cappadocia flourished greatly during his reign. He was succeeded by his son Ariarathes IV. who proved a very warlike prince, and having overcome Arsaces, founder of the Parthian monarchy, considerably enlarged his own dominions.\n",
      "He was succeeded by Ariarathes V. who, marrying the daughter of Antiochus the Great, entered into an alliance with that prince against the Romans; but Antiochus being defeated, the king of Cappadocia was obliged to sue for peace, which he obtained, after having paid two hundred talents by way of fine, for taking up arms against the people of Rome. He afterwards assisted the republic with men and money against Perseus king of Macedon, on which account he was by the senate honoured with the title of the friend and ally of the Roman people. He left the kingdom in a very flourishing condition to his son Mithridates, who, on his accession, took the name of Ariarathes VI.\n",
      "This prince, surnamed Philopater, from the filial respect and love he showed his father from his very infancy, immediately renewed the alliance with Rome. Out of mere good nature, he restored Mithrobarzanes, son to Ladria-des, king of the Lesser Armenia, to his father’s kingdom, though he foresaw that the Armenians would lay hold of that opportunity to join Artaxias, who was then on the point of invading Cappadocia. These differences, however, were settled before they came to an open rupture, by the Roman legates; and Ariarathes seeing himself thus delivered from an impending war by the mediation of the republic, presented the senate with a golden crown, and offered his service in whatever way they might think proper to employ him. The senate in return sent him a staff and chair of ivory; which were presents usually bestowed on those only whom they looked upon as attached to their interest. Not long before this, Demetrius Soter, king of Syria, had offered Ariarathes in marriage, his sister, the widow of Perseus king of Macedon; but this offer the king of Cappadocia was obliged to decline for fear of offending the Romans; and his so doing proved in tlιe highest degree acceptable to the republic, who reckoned him among the chief of her allies. Demetrius, however, being greatly incensed at the slight put upon his sister, set up a pretender to the throne, one Orophernes, a supposititious, or, as others call him, a natural son of the deceased king. The Romans ordered Eumenes, king of Pergamus, to assist Ariarathes with all his forces; which he accordingly did, but to no purpose; for the confederates were overthrown by Demetrius, and Ariarathes was obliged to abandon the kingdom Łq his rival. This happened about 159 years before Christ, and the usurper immediately dispatched ambassadors to Rome with a golden crown. The senate declined accepting the present till they heard his pretensions to the kingdom; and these Orophernes, by suborned witnesses, made to appear so plain, that the senate decreed that Ariarathes and he should reign as partners; but next year Orophernes was driven out by Attalus, brother to Eumenes, and his successor to the kingdom of Pergamus.\n",
      "Ariarathes, being thus restored, immediately demanded of the Priennians four hundred talents of gold which Oro-phcrncs had deposited with them. They honestly replied, that as they had been trusted with the money by Orophernes, they could deliver it to none but himself, or such as came in his name. Upon this the king entered their territories with an army, destroying all with fire and sword. The Priennians, however, still persevered in their integrity, and, though their city was besieged by the united forces of Ariarathes and Attalus, not only made an obstinate defence, but found means to restore the sum to Orophernes. At last they applied for assistance to the Romans, who enjoined the two kings to raise the siege, under pain of being declared enemies to the republic. Ariarathes immediately obeyed; and marching his army into Assyria, joined Alexander Epiphanes against Demetrius Sotcr, by whom he had been formerly driven out of hi⅛ kingdom. In the very first engagement Demetrius was slain, and his army entirely dispersed, Ariarathes having on that occasion given uncommon proofs of his courage and conduct. Some years afterwards, a war breaking out between the Romans and Aristonicus, who claimed the kingdom of Pergamus in right of his father, Ariarathes joined the former, and was slain In the same battle in which Crassus, proconsul of Asia, was taken, and the Roman army cut in pieces. He left six sons by his wife Laodice, on whom the Romans bestowed Lycaonia and Cilicia. But Laodice, fearing lest her children, when they came of age, should take the government out of hcr hands, poisoned five of them, the youngest only having escaped her cruelty by being conveyed out of the kingdom. The queen herself was soon afterwards put to death by her subjects, who could not bear her cruel and tyrannical government.\n",
      "Laodice was succeeded by Ariarathes VIL, who, soon after his accession, married another Laodice, daughter to Mithridates the Great, hoping to find in that prince a powerful friend to support him against Nicomcdes, king of Bithynia, who laid claim to part of Cappadocia. But Mithridates, instead of assisting, procured one Gordius to poison his unhappy son-in-law, and on his death seized the kingdom, under pretence of maintaining the rights of the Cappadocians against Nicomedes, till the children of Ariarathes were in a condition to govern the kingdom. The Cappadocians at first fancied themselves obliged to their new protector; but finding him unwilling to resign the kingdom to the lawful heir, thcy rose up in arms, and driving out all the garrisons cstablishcd by Mithridates, placed on the throne Ariarathes VIII. eldest son of their deceased king.\n",
      "The ncw prince found himself immediately engaged in a war with Nicomedes; but, being assisted by Mithridates, not only drove him out of Cappadocia, but stripped him of a great part of his hereditary dominions. On the conclusion of the peace, Mithridates, seeking for some pretence to quarrel with Ariarathes, insisted upon his recalling Gordius, who had murdered his father, which being rejected with abhorrence, a war ensued. Mithridates took the field first, in hopes of overrunning Cappadocia before Ariarathes could be in a condition to make head against him; but, contrary to his expectation, he was met on the frontiers by the king of Cappadocia, with an army no way inferior to his own. Hereupon he invited Ariarathes to a conference, and, in sight of both armies, stabbed him with a dagger which he had concealed under his garment. This struck such terror into the Cappadocians, that they immediately dispersed, and gave Mithridates an opportunity of possessing himself of the kingdom without the least opposition. The Cappadocians, however, unable to endure the tyranny of his prefects, soon shook off the yoke, and recalling the king’s brother, who had fled into the province of Asia, proclaimed him king. He was scarcely seated on the throne, however, before Mithridates invaded the kingdom at the head of a very numerous army; and having drawn Ariarathes to a battle, defeated his army with great slaughter, and obliged him to abandon the kingdom. The unhappy princc soon after dicd of grief, and Mithridates bestowed the kingdom on his son, who was then but eight years old, giving him also the name of Ariarathcs. But Nicomedes Philopater, king of Bithynia, fearing lest Mithridates, having now got possession of the whole kingdom of Cappadocia, should invade his territories, suborned a youth to pass himself for the third son of Ariarathes, and to present to him, the king, a petition, praying for aid, in order that the petitioner might be restored to his father’s kingdom. With him Nicomedes sent to Rome Laodice, sister of Mithr\n",

MM, the lower plate of the body, revolves with a turned bearing round the spindle. N N, the frame that carries the centre of the intermediate pinions NNN, which frame revolves in turned bearings round the spindle. 0, the centre pinion, is fixed to the spindle. PP, the large wheel, is a fixture to the beams. Q, a collar, is bolted to the spindle on which the lower body rests. R, a collar to support the frame U. S, the step, is a strong piece of wood passing from beam to beam; it is secured by bolts to the beams, and supported by stauncheons from the deck; an iron cup with a brass bushing is let into it, to receive the lower end of the spindle.\n",

      "Fig. 2 is a plan of the works used in fig, 1, which shows that the centre wheel is but one half the size of the exterior wheel, although possessing a power of three to one. The parts of the works are lettered similar to those of fig 1, being a plan corresponding with that elevation.\n",
      "Fig. 3 is a plan of the works in fig. 4, the parts being lettered the same, and answering to the elevation described in fig. 4.\n",
      "Fig. 4 shows the elevation of the upper capstan, with the works partly in section partly in elevation, and an elevated section of the lower capstan of a frigate. A, the upper capstan, is firmly secured to the spindle by crosses and an iron bolt. B, the spindle, which runs the length of both capstans, is a fixture to the upper one and false head, but revolves freely in the lower capstan. C C, the false head, is attached to a hexagon on the spindle; it may be let on in halves, and when fixed to the spindle will prevent the lower capstan from rising. D D, the lower capstan, is made entire; head, whelps, body, and pecul-head, similar to any other capstan, but revolving in turned bearings round the spindle.' E, the collar that carries the lower capstan. F, the partners, are made like those of plain capstans, with iron spindles, with a cup let in to receive the toe. G G, drop bolts, which serve to connect or disconnect the false head to the lower capstan. H H, the standards, are secured at their base to the trundle-head, and on their upper end is fixed a circular ring, which supports the centres of the intermediate pinions NNN; which ring is attached by pillars to the upper flanch N N, with the pinions working between the plates N N. 0, the centre pinion, is let on the hexagonal part of the spindle, and is consequently a fixture to it. Q Q, the guides, are iron carriages, that are secured to the beams, and in which the bolts R R traverse. R R, the bolts which serve to fix the large wheel when the increased power is in use, by grooves in stubbs, fixed at opposite diameters of the rim of the large wheel. These bolts slide backwards and forwards in the guides, QQ. S S is a blocking of wood attached to the beams to support the carriages of the bolts R R. T T are the upper and lower deck beams, shoλvn in section.\n",
      "Fig. 5 is an elevation of the lower capstan of a frigate, with the spindle separated beneath the quarter-deck, and is constructed in every way similar to fig. 1, excepting that the trundle-head is connected to the body and whelps, and plays loosely round the spindle. A fixed head or plate, firmly secured to the spindle, attaches the lower capstan to the spindle by the upper deck bolts G G; it will therefore be only necessary to describe those parts that differ from fig. 1. C C, the false head, is secured to the spindle on an hexagonal bearing; D, the trundle-head, is a fixture to the lower body. The bolts G G and L L will be correspondent in strength to the spindle.\n",
      "The mode of using these capstans will be more fully understood by referring to the letters in the plate and description.\n",
      "When the upper bolts GG in fig. 1 are down, and the lower ones LL are suspended by the chains to the upper cheek, the capstan has no power beyond the leverage of the bars, as the works are totally disconnected with the capstans. To increase the power, elevate the bolts GG, and let the chains loose that suspend the bolts LL, when these bolts will fix themselves by their weight in the frame NN, and thus connect the lower body with the works. By the upper bolts GG being elevated, the lower body becomes detached from the head; and in this state, when the upper capstan is hove round, the lower capstan receives its motion by the bolts LL through the medium of the works. The lower head D, being a fixture to the spindle, has the power of setting the works in motion, as well as the upper capstan, and consequently the power may be acted upon on either deck. When all the bolts are up, the capstans are separated; the lower capstan will then remain stationary, and the upper capstan may be used to spring the ship, or for any other distinct purpose, whilst the messenger may remain during this period passed round the lower capstan body, ready to weigh the anchor.\n",
      "In fig. 4 the works are between the quarter-deck beams. To increase the power, lock the large wheel P (that is, secure it by the bolts RR), and disconnect the false head CC from the lower capstan by elevating the bolts GG. Heave round on the quarter-deck capstan, and the power will be in action by the lower capstan being set in motion by the pillars HH through the medium of the works. To use it as a plain capstan, unlock the large wheel by withdrawing the bolts RR, and dropping the upper bolts GG, when both capstans and the λvorks will traverse round together. To disconnect the capstans (that is, to use them for separate purposes), suspend the bolts GG and withdraw the bolts RR, when the works will go round with the lower capstan by means of the pillars HH, and the spindle with the upper one.\n",
      "In fig. 5 the false head is a fixture to the spindle, and the lower capstan revolves round it. To increase the power, elevate the bolts GG, and drop the lower bolts LL. To use the capstan for separate purposes, lift all the bolts and keep them suspended; to make it a plain capstan, suspend the lower bolts LL, and keep the upper ones GG down.\n",
      "The improvements above described consist in adapting an arrangement of wheel works to the capstan, to assist it with an increase of power when the power of the plain capstan is found to be insufficient. The arrangement ot fig. 1 is similar to that which has been in general use in his majesty’s service for these last ten years, and many instances have presented themselves during this period of the great benefit to be derived from the improvement. Among these, it will be sufficient to enumerate the essential use of which it proved to Sir Edward Parry, and all the later expeditions fitted out from this country for the purpose of maritime discovery; to the Diamond frigate, commanded by Lord Napier; to the Isis, by Sir Thomas Staines; to the Pelosus, by Captain Quin; to the Jupiter in the Gulf of St Lawrence; to the Druid and AEtna, commanded by Captain Sandon; and to the Tamac, by Captain Bremer.\n",
      "The wheel λvork is so arranged that the power may be applied or relieved from it almost instantaneously; and the leading feature of the improvement is, that both capstans traverse the same way, either as a plain capstan, or when set in motion by the machinery; and the increase of power obtained is in the ratio of one revolution of the first mover more than the revolution gained by the difference of diameter between the first period and the large wheel. This is gained by making the large wheel stationary, and the centres of the iñtermediate pinions the means of communication with the capstan. Captain Phillips’ capstans are so generally adopted in his majesty’s service, tha\n",

      "a well-known species of covering, chiefly employed for the floors of rooms, but also used for a variety of other purposes. Carpets are of oriental origin, and are made of different sorts of stuffs; some of them of silk ornamented with gold, đthers of cotton, but by far the greater part of wool. They are woven in a variety of ways.\n",
      "Persia and Turkey carpets are the most esteemed. They are woven in a piece, in looms of a very simple construction, being only composed of two beams placed the one above the other, about eight feet separate, in parallel lines; the warp of the web being put on the uppermost, and brought down the undermost beam, through heddles. The pattern to be wrought is drawn and painted on design paper, and placed before the weaver, who works the figure into the warp with dyed worsted yarn, cut into proper lengths. He then passes a woof shot through the web, to bind the worsted yarn. When the carpet is made to the dimensions required, it is then taken out of the loom and dressed with shears made for the purpose. Till of late years the manufacture of these carpets was confined to Persia and Turkey; but they are now successfully imitated at Λxminster in the south of England, and at Kilmarnock in the west of Scotland.\n",
      "Brussels, Wilton, imperial Brussels, and royal Wilton carpets, are all woven in looms of the same construction, and derive their names from the places where they were invented. The difference of their fabric consists as follows, viz. in the Brussels, the worsted yarn raised to form the pile and show the figure is not cut; in the Wilton the pile is cut, and has the appearance of velvet; in the imperial Brussels the figure is raised above the ground, and the pile cut, the ground uncut; and in the royal W τ ilton the pile is raised higher than in the Wilton, and cut, which makes it a more massy carpet. The cloth of these carpets is composed of linen and worsted, and the loom for weaving them is very ingeniously constructed. The linen is put on a beam, and brought through heddles and a reed; it is only used to bind the worsted yarn, and should not appear on the right side. The better it is covered, the more complete and perfect is the carpet.\n",
      "The worsted yarn is put on small bobbins, with a weight attached to each to keep the yarn of a uniform tightness. There are in some of the looms 1300, and in others 1800 of these bobbins (according to the width of the web, which is generally twenty-seven inches, although some are thirty-six inches), placed in frames behind the loom, and planted of different coloured yarn, to answer the figure. The yarn is then passed through the harness, heddles, and reed, to combine with the linen yarn, and form the cloth. The harness is tied to tail-cords, which are passed through a frame filled with small pulleys; a simple is then attached to the tail cords, and brought down by the side of the loom, upon which the pattern of the carpet intended to be wrought is put with lashes and drawn by boys. Machines have been introduced in place of boys, but they have  not been found to answer the purpose so well as in the other sorts of carpeting. When the boy draws the lash, he has in one hand a piece of thin board, three feet long and six inches broad, which is called a sword. This sword he passes through under the yarn so drawn with the lash, and keeps it on its edge until the weaver passes a wire through in front of the reed. This wire keeps up the worsted, and the weaver throws two shots of linen woof through the web, and forms the pile. It is necessary to have sixty of these wires for raising the pile, and at all times to have at least six of them in the web next to the reed, or else the worsted would sink, and the linen appear on the right side of the carpet, which is a great defect. When it is intended to make Wilton and royal W τ ilton, the wires that are used have a groove in them; and a small knife with a guide to it, called a travat, is drawn across the web into the groove, and cuts the pile: and for making imperial Brussels both a round wire and a grooved wire are used at the same time.\n",
      "Double or Kidderminster carpeting is composed of two plies of cloth, and having what is called a right and a wrong side, the colours being reversed. Suppose a carpet of scarlet and black, what is scarlet on one side will be black on the other. They are, however, made in a variety of colours; and when done so, the warp of the web is made of small yarn, so that when it happens to be of a different colour from the woof, it may appear as little as possible; for in this sort of carpeting there cannot be put more than two colours in a line without mixing, whereas in Brussels five can be thus put.\n",
      "The warp of the web is put all on one beam, and passed through the harness and reed; the figure intended to be wrought is raised by a machine placed on the top of the loom above the harness. A machine was in use for this purpose, which was invented in Kilmarnock about eighteen years ago, and was wrought on the principle of the organ barrel; but it is now superseded by another, where the figure is cut on paper, and is consequently called a paper machine. It is of French invention, and was originally used in the silk trade, but is now in common use in the carpet trade. One great advantage which the paper machine has over that of the barrel, is, that when once a pattern is cut, it can be woven at any time (for an indefinite number of patterns may be wrought in one machine), and it is only necessary to take out one pattern and lay it past for future use, and put in another, which can be done in ten minutes; whereas on the barrel machine, the figure, which is put on with small wire pins, when it is required to be changed, must all bc taken out and put on anew, or else have a number of barrels for each machine, which adds greatly to the expense.\n",
      "This sort of carpeting differs from Brussels, inasmuch as that both warp and woof appear on the surface of the cloth, whereas in Brussels it is the warp only.\n",
      "With regard to three-ply imperial or Scotch carpeting, although it is only recently that this sort of carpeting has been made, it is getting very much into repute, and is considered very little inferior to Brussels. Some years ago an attempt was made in England to make three-ply carpeting, but it did not succeed; they could not make the figure distinct on both sides, and it was abandoned. Kilmarnock has the merit of obviating this defect, by bringing them to their present state, and of fairly establishing the trade, which has now become very considerable, and is still increasing.\n",
      "They are woven in the same way, and in looms of the same construction, as the two-ply carpeting, having three plies of cloth in place of two plies, which makes them much more durable and comfortable, being nearly one half heavier in the fabric, and every way superior in appearance.\n",
      "In this sort of carpeting, as well as in the two-ply Kidderminster, it is the woof which predominates, and shows the figure.\n",
      "French or tapestry carpeting differs from Kidderminster and three-ply imperial Scotch carpeting, inasmuch as it is the warp of the web, which is made of worsted, that shows the figure. In other respects they are much the same, and are woven in looms of the same construction, with a machine and the other appendages.\n",
      "Venetian carpeting is made both plain and figured, and is used mostly for stairs, passages, and lobbies.\n",
      "Plain Venetian carpets are woven in looms of a very simple construction, having only heddles and reed. The warp is a very heavy body of worsted yarn, and should cover the woof so completely that it cannot be seen. The pattern is generally in stripes, and shaded like the rainbow; and the great object of the manufacturer is to bring off the shade of colour from dark to light imperceptibly. They are likewise made checked, and in squares like a draughtboard. The figured Venetian are woven in looms of the same construction as the two-ply or Kidderminster carpeting, having a machine to raise the pattern wanted, which is entirely of the warp of the web, and is all worsted yarn, the woof being completely covered by it, which is composed of a thick shot of woollen and a small shot of linen yarn alternately.\n",
      "Besides these described above, there is also Dutch carpeting, which is woven much in the same way as plain Venetian, but a great deal coarser, some of them being made of cow hair.\n",
      "There are other branches of the arts and sciences upon which the successful manufacturing of carpeting very much depends, such as spinning, dyeing, and drawing. In Scotland it is matter of regret that so few artists have turned their attention to the designing aηd drawing of patterns for Persian, Turkey, Brussels, and double or three-ply carpeting. In England there are some who make it a very lucrative branch of trade, and we have no doubt but it may become equally so in this country.\n",
      "The carpet trade in Scotland is much indebted to the Board of Trustees for the Encouragement of domestic Manufactures, for the very liberal premiums given by them to the successful competitors in carpet weaving. They have, by their patriotic exertions, introduced into this country several sorts of carpeting, which are likely to become a very considerable branch of trade, and consequently employ a number of men, and likewise to consume a great portion of wool, a staple article of the country. The premiums sometimes amount to between six and seven hundred pounds.\n",

      "a town in the province of Ulster, in Ireland, which, with a small surrounding district, forms one of the eight counties of towns which enjoy an exclusive jurisdiction, separate from that of the county within which they are situated. It lies on the northern side of Carrickfergus Bay, called also the Lough of Belfast, and is surrounded on all other sides by the county of Antrim. The length and breadth of the whole county are about four miles each. A ridge of high ground extends along it from east to west, terminating on its western extremity by Slieve-true, a mountain which rises to the height of 1100 feet above the level of the sea, and commands an extensive prospect.\n",
      "About three miles to the north of the town of Carrickfergus, on an elevated range, upwards of 550 feet above the level of the sea, is Lough Morne, remarkable as being the largest sheet of fresh water at the same altitude in Ireland. Though its supply of water is extremely scanty, a stream issues from it containing a body of water sufficient, even during the driest seasons, to turn the works of a cotton-mill situated near the sea side. The only river in this district worthy of the name is the Woodburn, formed of two branches, on each of which there is a fine cascade; its stream supplies several mills and print-fields. The Silverstream and Copeland rivers are mere rivulets, remarkable only as marking the bounds of the county to the west and east.\n",
      "The town of Carrĩckfergus itself, from which the county and the adjoining bay take their names, is the only place of any consequence within the district. It takes its name from a large rock, in Irish carrich, projecting into the sea, on which its castle is built; and from Fergus, one of the ancient kings of Scotland, supposed to have been drowned in the neighbourhood. It was a place little known till the arrival of the English; soon after which event John de Courcy, to whom Henry II. had granted all the parts of Ulster he could gain possession of by his sword, fixed here a colony, which soon acquired stability and importance. Yet during the earlier period of its existence it was subject to many vicissitudes of fortune. In the reign of Edward II. it was taken by Edward Bruce, in his expedition to assert his right to the throne of Ireland. In 1386 it was burned by the Scotch, and in 1400 again destroyed by the combined forces of the Scotch and Irish, who had defeated an English fleet near Strangford. Subsequently it suffered much by famine and by the occasional assaults of the neighbouring Irish chieftains, whose favour the townsmen were at length necessitated to secure by the payment of an annual tribute.\n",
      "In the reign of Elizabeth its value as a military and commercial position was better appreciated. It obtained a charter, which confirmed its former extensive privileges, and added some new rights. The town was fortified by a substantial wall, strengthened with seven bastions. The corporation was also regulated. The mayor enjoyed the jurisdiction of high admiral of the adjoining seas, from Fairhead in the county of Antrim, to the Beerlooms, a point of land near the entrance of Strangford Lough in the county of Down. This charter was confirmed by James I. who added the additional right of sending two burgesses to parliament. It now became a place of considerable importance. At the commencement of the civil wars in 1641, an attempt to surprise it, made by Sir Henry M t Neil, was baffled by the vigilance of the governor, Colonel Arthur Chichester. It then became the principal place of refuge for the Protestants from the neighbouring counties. Shortly afterwards it was taken possession of by General Munroe on the part of the king; but, after holding it for some time, he was surprised and sent prisoner to England by Monk the parliamentary general, who, as a reward for this piece of service, was made governor, and received a grant of a sum of L.500. In the year 1689 it surrendered on terms to General Schomberg on the part of King William, but not till its ammunition had been wholly exhausted. Soon afterwards it was visited by W τ illiam in person, on his arrival in Ireland to head his troops previously to the battle of the Boyne. The town’s people still point out the precise stone on the quay where that monarch first set foot. In the beginning of the year 1760 it was unexpectedly surprised by a small French squadron commanded by M. Thurot, who, after holding it for a few days, evacuated it as quickly as he had entered it, in order to meet an English squadron which was in pursuit of him, and in an action with which he lost his life. In the year 1778 the town was again alarmed by the sudden appearance of the celebrated Paul Jones, who, however, made no attempt on it.\n",
      "The town extends along the sea-shore about a mile. It consists of three parts; the town within the walls, the Irish quarter on the west, and the Scotch quarter on the east. The principal building is the castle, standing on the projecting rock already mentioned, and surrounded by a wall of masonry, planted with about twenty pieces of artillery. The ancient keep or donjon is still in perfect preservation. It is ninety feet high.\n",
      "The parish church, an antiquated structure, in the shape of a cross, formed by the intersection of two narrow aisles, was originally a chapel or oratory dependent on a Franciscan monastery in another part of the town. The entrance of a subterraneous passage leading to it is still visible under the communion table of the church. One of the aisles is the private property of the Chichester family, who used it as a cemetery.\n",
      "The court-house of the county of Antrim, a neat modern building of a single story, forms the termination of the principal street. Close to it is the jail of the same county, built on the site of the monastery already mentioned, which, after the suppression of those buildings by Henry VIII. fell into the hands of the Chichester family. The corporation of Carrickfergus at present maintains no court-house or prison of its own.\n",
      "The other public buildings in the town are meetinghouses for dissenters, methodists, and independents. The town can boast of no literary institution of any kind whatsoever. It has, however, several of a charitable nature, as Lancasterian and Sunday schools. By a bequest of Henry Gill, a freeman, fourteen decayed old townsmen enjoy a residence and an annual allowance of L.10 each; and by another of Henry Adair, the interest of L.2000 is annually distributed among poor freemen. Formerly these be* quests were seldom sought after, but now the applications for them are numerous. The suburbs, called the Irish and Scotch quarters, are chicfly inhabited by fishermen.\n",
      "The government of the corporation is vested in a mayor, seventeen aidermen, and twenty-four burgesses, who together form the assembly, and exercise the right of enacting bye-laws and creating freemen. The freemen have no share in the local legislation. Their number amounts to about 800. The other corporate officers are two sheriffs, a recorder, a treasurer, two coroners, a town-clerk, a sword-bearer, and four serjeants-at-mace. The trades of the town arc formed into seven guilds, each under the control of a master and two wardens; the hammermen or carpenters are considered as the most respectable.\n",
      "The few villages within the precincts of the county are very small, the largest containing only thirty-five houses. Gentlemen’s seats are frequent along the coast, and add considerably to the appearance of the prospect. With the exception of their plantations, there is scarcely any standing timber, although strong evidence of the country having been formerly well wooded appears in the number of trunks of trees raised from the bogs, in one of which, situated on the shore beyond high-watcr mark, and therefore covered with sand and other marine deposits, there have been found, together with the trees, hazel-nuts, some of which were in a state of petrifaction. Petrified hazelnuts, and many other scarce fossil remains, are also found on the banks of Woodburn river.\n",
      "The chief minerals found here are basalt and limestone. The searches for coal have been uniformly unsuccessful. Gypsum is raised in large quantities, and conveyed to Belfast for exportation. A mineral spring, containing a purging nitrous salt, is situated in the eastern part of the town; and about a mile farther east is a pure saline spring, said to be the only one of the kind in Ireland. Near Lough Morne is a sulphureous chalybeate spring, once frequented, but latterly totally neglected.\n",
      "The only manufacture carried on to a considerable extent is the cotton, which has wholly superseded that of linen. It gives work to three large factories, and as many print-ficlds. In the town there are a brewcry and a distillery. The farms are small, except in the interior and hilly parts, where grazing is the principal occupation. Wheat is little sown, the chief crops being oats and potatoes, for which sea-weed, generally mixed with line and vegetable matter, forms the manure. Cheese of excellent quality is made in the neighbourhood of the town.\n",
      "According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of Ireland, this county forms a single rectory in the diocese of Connor. It now constitutes part of the corps of the deanery. It is rated in the king’s book at L.8 for first fruits; but its actual annual value, as ascertained under the tithe composition act, is L.400.\n",
      "A weekly market is held in the town on Saturdays, and fairs take place on the 12th of May and 1st of November. According to the latest observations, Carrickfergus is in long. 5. 47. W. and lat. 54. 43. N.\n",

      "a great inland sea of Asia, bounded on the north by the Russian government of Λstracan; on the east by the great sandy deserts of Tartary; on the south by the Persian province of Mazanderan; and on the west by the Persian province of Ghilan, the ridges of Caucasus, the principalities of Baku, Derbend, and Circassia, together with part of the government of Astracan. According to the most accurate surveys that have been made by Russian navigators, under the orders of Peter I., this sea extends in length from north to south 646 miles, in breadth 265 miles in the northern part, and 235 in the southern; and the total circuit of the coast, including gulfs and bays, is 2350 miles. The shore is flat all around, and there is no depth of water; but beyond this the depth is very great; and Hanway mentions that he could not find the bottom with a line of 480 fathoms. It is of very dangerous navigation on account of its frequent shallows along the shore, and many disasters occur to mariners. Fierce tempests occasionally burst forth from the high mountains which inclose it on different sides. There are certain winds that domineer over it with such absolute sway, that vessels are often deprived of every resource; and in the whole extent of it there is not a port that can truly be called safe. The north, north-east, and east winds, blow most frequently, and occasion the most violent tempests. Along the eastern shore the east winds prevail; for which reason vessels bound from Persia to Astracan always direct thcir course along this shore.\n",
      "The waters of the Caspian are as salt as those of the ocean, and very impure; the vast number of rivers that run into it, and the nature of its bottom, affecting it greatly. It is true, that in general the waters are salt; but though the whole western shore extends from the 46th to the 35th degree of north latitude, and though one might conclude from analogy that these waters would contain a great deal of salt, yet experiments prove the contrary; and it is certain that the saltness of this sea is diminished by the north, north-east, and north-west winds, although we may with equal reason conclude that it owes its saltness to the mines of salt which lie along its two banks, and which are either already known or will be known to posterity. The depth of these waters also diminishes gradually as you approach the shores, and thcir saltness in the same way grows less in proportion to their proximity to the land; the north winds not unfrequently causing the rivers to discharge into it vast quantities of troubled water impregnated with clay. These variations which the sea is exposed to are more or less considerable, according to the nature of the winds; and they affect the colour of the river waters to a certain distance from the shore, till these mix with that of the sea, which then resumes the ascendency, and the fine green colour appears which is natural to the ocean, and to all those bodies of water that communicate witlι it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is well known that, besides its salt taste, all sea-water has a sensible bitterness, which must be attributed not only to the salt itself, but to the mixture of different substances that unite with it, particularly to different sorts of alum, and is the ordinary effect of different combinations of acids. Besides this, the waters of the Caspian have another taste, bitter too, but quite diśtinct, which affects the tongue with an impression similar to that made by the bile of animals; a property which ⅛ peculiar to this sca, though not equally sensible at all seasons. When the north and northwest winds have raged for a considerable time, this bitter taste is sensibly felt; but when the wind has been south, very imperfectly. We shall endeavour to account for this phenomenon.\n",
      "The Caspian is bounded on its western side by the mountains of Caucasus, which extend from Derbend to the Black Sea. These mountains make a curve near Astracan, and directing their course towards the eastern shore of the Caspian, lose themselves near the mouth of the Yaik, where they become secondary mountains, being disposed in strata. As Caucasus is an inexhaustible magazine of combustible substances, it consequently lodges an astonishing quantity of metals in its bowels. Accordingly, along the foot of this immense chain of mountains, we sometimes meet with warm springs, sometimes springs of naphtha of different quality; sometimes we find native sulphur, mines of vitriol, or lakes heated by internal fires. Now the foot of Mount Caucasus forming the immediate western shore of the Caspian Sea, it is very easy to imagine that a great quantity of the constituent parts of the former must be communicated to the latter; but it is chicfly to the naphtha, which abounds so much in the countries which surround this sea, that we must attribute the true cause of the bitterness peculiar to its waters; for it is certain that this bitumen flows from the mountains, sometimes in all its purity, and sometimes mixed with other substances which it acquires in its passage through subterranean channels, from the most interior parts of these mountains to the sea, where it falls to the bottom by its specific gravity. It is certain, too, that the north and north-west winds detach the greatest quantities of this naphtha, whence it is evident that the bitter taste must be most sensible when these winds prevail. We may also comprehend why this taste is not so strong at the surface or in the neighbourhood of the shore, the waters there being less impregnated with salt, and the naphtha, which is united with the water by the salt, being then either carried to a distance by the winds, or precipitated to the bottom. But it is not a bitter taste alone that the naphtha communicates to the waters of the Caspian. These waters were analysed by M. Gmelin, and found to contain, besides the common sea salt, a considerable proportion of Glauber salt, intimately united with the former, and which is evidently a production of the naphtha.\n",
      "The Caspian Sea receives the contents of numerous rivers, which give a tinge to its waters; and it is only at a distance from their mouths that it presents the deep azure hue of the ocean. It is probably also owing to the quantity of extraneous substances carried down by these rivers that there are so many dangerous shoals and so few good harbours within its compass; and, considering the number and size of its numerous rivers, it is not easy to conceive how so vast a quantity of water can be carried off by evaporation. On the north is the Yaik, 100 fathoms wide and eighteen feet deep at the mouth; next the Yemba, or Jemba, at the distance of sixty-one miles; the great Oxus flows in at the west side, seventy miles north of the Gulf of Karabogaskoi. Ninety-three miles south of this gulf the river Doria flows into the Caspian, forty miles farther south the Ossa or the Orzantes, the Naren and Asterabad on the south-east extremity, and the Kizitozein on the south-west. From the vast Caucasian chain of mountains which forms the western coast descend numerous rivers, the chief of which is the Thur, which, after receiving the Araxes, is discharged into the Caspian by five different mouths; and at the higher extremity is the Wolga, which pours an immense volume of water into the same sea by thirty-two different channels. Many of these rivers run with a furious course into the Caspian, and in travelling along its shores experienced guides are necessary to find out the practicable fords in these torrents, which frequently sweep, by the irresistible fury of their stream, both man and horse into the ocean. Fraser, who travelled in Persia in 1822, mentions, that the day before he passed the river of Chahloos, a woman on horseback was carried away in this manner and perished.^[1. See Fraser’s Travels and Adventures on the Southern Banks of the Caspian Sea , chap, viii. ]\n",
      "There are numerous islands in the Caspian, some of them of great extent. Towards the north-east is the island of Kulaha, with a good harbour; and on the same side, between lat. 39. and 40., Idak, Deverish, Naphthonia, which extends about twenty miles in length from north to south, and contains several wells of naphtha, and abundance of good water; Dargan, Dagadaw, and Ogrujinskoi in the Gulf of Balkan, or near its mouth. Chitcheena, called Czeczeni by D’Anville, and Trenzeni by others, is the most important of all the islands in the Caspian. It is situated on the western coast, opposite to the city of Yerki in Circassia. On the same side, and much farther south, are the islands of Swetoizeloi, Toolen, and Kura. Between 42. and 43. north latitude a sand extends sixty miles in length by twenty-seven or thirty in breadth, with twenty fathoms depth of water, which is always discoloured. There are several islands on this bank, which are generally of inconsiderable size, and for the most part near the shore.\n",
      "A great proportion of the northern coast of the Caspian is low and marshy, or composed of sandy flats; and there is no depth of water to float a vessel several miles from the shore. There are here also many dangerous quicksands, in which travellers are frequently swallowed up; and Fraser, the enterprising traveller already mentioned, had a narrow escape. His horse sunk in a shallow so deep that the water flowed over his back, and it was only by turning short and floundering backwards until he got his fore-feet on solid ground that he was enabled to regain the shore. In other parts the coast is rocky, or high and mountainous, and has several spacious bays, which are calculated to afford shelter to shipping. The Gulf of Is-kawder, or Alexander, towards the northern extremity, is a fine harbour, twenty miles long and twelve broad. The Gulf of Karabogaskoi, or Carabuga, in lat. 4L 21., extends fifty-five miles by fifty-three in an elliptical form, with very deep water. The Gulf of Balkan lies at the base of the mountain of that name; and in the south-east extremity \n",

      "an excellent astronomer, was born at Piedmont in 1635. His early proficiency in astronomy procured him an invitation to become mathematical professor at Bologna when he was only fifteen years of age; and a comet having appeared in 1652, he discovered that bodies of this kind are not accidental meteors, but of the same nature, and probably governed by the same laws, as the planets. In the same year he solved a problem abandoned by Kepler and Bullialdus as insolvable; which was to determine geometrically the apogee and eccentricity of a planet from its true and mean place. In 1663 he was appointed inspector-general of the fortifications of the castle of Urbino, and had afterwards the care of all the rivers in the ecclesiastical states. He still, however, prosecuted his astronomical studies, in the course of which he discovered the revolution of Mars round his own axis; and in 1666 he published his theory of Jupiter’s satellites. Cassini was invited by Louis XIV. in 1669 to visit France, where he settled as the first professor in the royal observatory. In 1677 he demonstrated the line of Jupiter’s diurnal rotation; and in 1684 discovered four more satellites belonging to Saturn, Huygens having observed one. Cassini was principally instrumental in causing the French government undertake the expedition to Cayenne, which served to correct many errors relative to the figure of the earth, at the same time that it demonstrated the decrease of the intensity of terrestrial gravity from the equator to the poles; a phenomenon which exhibits a striking confirmation of the theory of gravitation. In 1693 he published new tables of the satellites of Jupiter, more exact than those which he had given to the world in 1668. In 1693 he went to revisit his meridian of St Pétrone, which he regarded with honest pride; but he was now occupied with another and much longer meridian, commenced in 1669 by Picard,, continued to the north of Paris in 1683 by De Lahirc, and lastly, in 1700, carried by Cassini himself to the extremity of Roussillon; being the same line which, forty years after, was measured anew by François Cassini and La Caille, and, at the same distance of a century, measured a third time by Méchain and Delambre, with a precision which left little more to be desired. In the last years of his life he lost.his sight, a misfortune which befcl him in common with Galileo, and which probably proceeded from the same cause, namely, excessive application to the delicate observations of astronomy. Cassini inhabited the royal observatory at Paris more than forty years, and dicd on the 14th September 1712, “sans maladie, sans douleur, uniquement par la nécessite de mourir.” In Lalande’s Ei-bliograj)hie Astronomique will be found a complete enumeration of the various works of Cassini; we need only cite here, I. Observationes Cometoe Ann. 1655 ct 1653, Modena, 1653, fol.; 2. Opera Astronomica, Rome, 166G,' 3. Nuntii Syderei Interpres ; 4. Cosmographie. Cassini, James, another celebrated astronomer, the only son of the former. He was born at Paris on the 18th February 1677. His early studies were conducted in his father’s house, where, from the pursuits and studies of his father, mathematics, and their application to astronomy, were probably not neglected. He afterwards became a student at the Mazarin College, at the time that the celebrated Varignon was professor of mathematics. With the assistance of this eminent man, young Cassini made such progress, that at fifteen years of age he supported a mathematical thesis with great honour. At the age of seventeen he was admitted as a member of the Academy of Sciences; and the same year he accompąnied his father in a journey to Italy, where he assisted him in the verification of the meridian at Bologna and in other measurements. After his return he performed similar operations in Holland, and discovered some errors in the measurement of the earth by Snell, the result of which was communicated to the academy in 1702. In 1696 hc also made a visit to England, where he was elected a member of the Royal Society. In 1712 hc succeeded his father as astronomer-royal at the observatory of Paris. In 1717 he gave to the academy his researches on the distance of the fixed stars, in which he showed that the whole annual orbit, of near two hundred millions of miles diameter, is but as a point in comparison of their distance. The same year he also communicated his discoveries concerning the inclination of the orbits of the satellites in general, and especially of those of Saturn’s satellites and ring. In 1725 he undertook to determine the cause of the moon’s libration, by which she shows sometimes a little on the one side, and sometimes a little on the other, of that half which is commonly behind, or hid from our view.\n",
      "In 1732 an important question in astronomy engaged the ingenuity of our author. His father had determined, by his observations, that the planet Venus revolved about her axis in the space of twenty-three hours; and Μ. Bain-chini had published a work in 1729, in which he settled the period of the same revolution in twenty-four days eight hours. From an examination of Bianchini's observations, which were upon the spots in Venus, he discovered that he had intermitted his observations for the space of three hours, from which cause he had probably mistaken new spots for the old ones, and so had been lcd into the mistake. Hc also determined the nature and quantity of the acceleration of the motion of Jupiter at half a second per year, and of that of the retardation of Saturn at two minutes per year; also that these quantities would go on increasing for two thousand years, and then would decrease again. In 1740 he published his Astronomical Tables, and his Elements of Astronomy; both very extensive and accurate works.\n",
      "Although astronomy was the principal object of our author’s pursuit, he did not confine himself absolutely to that science, but made occasional excursions into other fields. We owe to him Experiments on Electricity; Experiments on the Recoil of Fire-arms; Researches on the Rise of the Mercury in the Barometer at different Heights; Reflections on the perfecting of Burning-glasses; and other interesting memoirs.\n",
      "One of the most important objects of the French academy was the measurement of the earth. In 1669 Picard measured a little more than a degree of latitude to the north of Paris; but as that extent appeared too small from which to deduce the whole circumference with sufficient accuracy, it was resolved to continue the measurement on the meridian of Paris to the north and the south, throughout the whole extent of the country. Accordingly, in 1683, M. de Lahire continued that on the north side of Paris, and the older Cassini that on the south side, while, in the continuation of this operation, the latter was, in 1700, assisted by his son. The same work was further continued by the same academicians; and finally, the part left unfinished by Dc Lahire in the north was finished in 1718 by our author, Maraldi, and De Lahire the younger.\n",
      "These operations produced a very considerable degree of precision. From this measured extent of six degrees, it appeared also that the degrees were of different lengths in different parts of the meridian; and our author concluded, in the volume published for 1718, that they decreased more and more towards the pole, and that therefore the figure of the earth was that of an oblong spheroid, or having its axis longer than the equatorial diameter. He also measured a perpendicular to the same meridian, and compared the measured distance with the differences of longitude as before determined by the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites; from which he concluded that the length of the degrees of longitude was smaller than it would be on a sphere, and that therefore again the figure of the earth was that of an oblong spheroid, contrary to the determination of Newton by the theory of gravity. Newton was indeed of all men the most averse from controversy; but the other mathematicians in Britain did not tamely submit to conclusions in direct opposition to the fundamental doctrine of this great philosopher. The consequence was, that the French government sent two different sets of mathematicians, the one to measure a degree at the equator, the other at the polar circle; and the comparison of the whole determined the figure to be that of an oblate spheroid, contrary to the conclusion of Cassini.\n",
      "After a long and laborious life, James Cassini died in April 1756, and was succeeded in the academy and observatory by his second son. He published, 1. Expanse d la Dissertation de Μ. Celsius sur les Observations faites pour pouvoir determiner la figure de la Terre, 1738, 8vo; 2. Εlemens d ’ Astronomie, Paris, 1740, 4to; 3. Tables Astronomiques du Soleil, de la Tune, des Planetes, des Etoiles, ei des Satellites, Paris, 1740, 4to.\n",
      "Cassini de Thury, Coesar François, a celebrated French astronomer, director of the observatory, and member of most of the learned societies of Europe, was born at Paris on the 17th June 1714. He was .the second son of Jamcs Cassini, whose occupations and talents he inherited and supported with great honour. He received his first lessons in astronomy and mathematics from MM. Maraldi and Camus; and made such rapid progress, that when he was not more than tcn years of age he calculated the phases of a total eclipse of the sun. At the age of eighteen he accompanied his father in his two journeys undertaken to draw a perpendicular to the mcridian of the observatory, from Strasburg to Brest. A general chart of France was then projected; and for this purpose it was necessary to traverse the country by several lines parallel and perpendicular to the mcridian of Paris. Our author was charged with the conduct of this work, in the execution of which he was so scrupulous as to measure again what had been previously measured by his father. This great work was published in \n",

      "an Italian poet, was born of humble parents in the year 1721, at Montefiascone, a small town in the States of the Church. It was there, too, that he commenced his studies, in which he made such rapid progress that he was appointed in early youth a professor of Greek and Latin in an academy of his native town; an employment which peculiarly directed his attention to classical poetry and literature. He soon, however, quitted this obscure situation, and repaired to Rome in search of more noble examples of emulation, and a higher recompense of public esteem, than his birth-place afforded him. His learning, acuteness, and agreeable disposition, recommended him to the notice and friendship of the most eminent individuals of that capital. He was admitted a member of the academy Degli Arcadi ; and it is believed he might easily have risen from a canonship in the cathedral of Montefiascone, which he had already obtained, to the enjoyment of much higher church benefices, had such been the chief objects of his ambition. But his love of freedom, and his restless inclination for travelling, which appears to have been characteristic of all the literary men of Italy, interfered with his ecclesiastical preferment. He gladly accepted the invitation of Prince Rosenberg (tutor to the Grand Duke Leopold), with whom he had become acquainted at Florence, to accompany him to Vienna, where he was presented to the Emperor Joseph. After this introduction, he visited almost all the capitals of Europe, from Petersburg to Lisbon, and from Constantinople to Stockholm, directing his particular attention to the manners and civil institutions of the various countries through which he passed. On his return to Vienna he was appointed Poeta Cesario or poet-laureate, in the room of Metastasio; a situation which he held till some time after the death of the Emperor Leopold, when he resigned it, and retired to Florence in 1796. During two years’ residence in that city, he composed a great number of his works. At the end of that period he went to live in Paris; and though now far advanced in life, neither his habitual gaiety nor the ardour of literary composition were in any degree abated. Scarcely a day passed in which he did not add something to his principal poem Gli Animali Parianti, or write one of his poetical novels. At the same time he delighted the society with which he lived by the unceasing liveliness of his conversation, which was rendered highly entertaining and interesting by his knowledge of the world, and the extensive opportunities he had possessed of observing the manners and characters of mankind. Though in 1803 he had passed the age of eighty-two, the strength both of his mind and body still afforded the promise of a yet longer life; but he died during this year, in consequence of having caught a severe cold in returning home at a late hour from a house where he had spent the evening. His funeral was attended by a great concourse of French and Italians, distinguished by literary eminence; and an eloquent funeral oration was pronounced on this occasion, by Corona, an Italian physician.\n",
      "The chief work of Casti is Gli Animali Parianti, Poema Epico, Diviso in XXVI. Canti. In 1792 and 1793 the French revolution had attracted the attention and speculations of all Europe, and had introduced comparisons between new theories of government and ancient institutions. The rage of innovation, and dislike of established forms, having infected the minds of so large a proportion of the community, Casti resolved to exhibit, though under an allegorical veil, what he conceived to be the predominant feelings of the multitude, their avowed hopes, and secret designs. With this view, as he himself has expressed it in his preface, “he contrived a grand apologue, divided into parts, and forming a continued poem, in which animals being introduced as speakers and actors, a complete political story might be exhibited, exposing the defects of various political systems, and the absurdity of many institutions which had been from timeto time adopted.” Near the commencement of this apologue the beasts assemble to choose a king, and, after a good deal of intrigue and various harangues, the lion is elected. On his death, the folly of the lioness regent, and perversity of the royal cub, excite murmurs, cabals, and at length a successful insurrection, which is headed by the dog. By thus assigning to animals human speech and passions, the author has very happily parodied the usual appearances and events of political revolutions in general, but often with some allusion to the political events of the day, to the characters of the reigning princes of Europe, and to that most portentous of all revolutions, the consequences of which at the time occupied so large a portion of the thoughts of mankind.\n",
      "Accordingly, we find that in this work Casti has portrayed and satirized the hypocrisy so often mixed in political pretensions; the secret ambition of leaders who alternately supplant and succeed each other; the intolerance of cabals and parties, who proscribe all who have not ranged themselves under their banners, and who regard the maxims which happen to be then in vogue as fixed and immutable principles. He has represented with peculiar felicity the democratic declamations of the dog once so loyal, the aristocratic surliness of the bear, the simple good-nature of Lion I., and the caprices of his cub Lion II., who is obviously intended for a late czar of Muscovy. It must, however, be confessed, that the pleasantry of an apologue of twenty-six cantos, each of about 600 lines, is too much prolonged; and the too frequent negligence of the style, with the repetition of trivial and obvious morals, like those at the bottom of the page in the English AEsops Fables, do not aid in sustaining the curiosity or interest.\n",
      "This work of Casti, which raised him to a very high rank among the modern poets of his country, was begun at Vienna in 1794. His situation, however, as poet-laureate, was unfavourable to the freedom of political satire, and this obstacle to his favourite pursuit may have been one inducement to his resignation of that office. After his retirement, the poem was continued at Florence without interruption, and completed at Paris, where it was published in 1802, in 3 vols. 8vo; an impression which has been followed by various editions in Italy. It was translated into French, Spanish, and German, and we have also seen a free and abridged English version, executed with considerable vivacity and spirit. To most of the Italian editions four apologues have been added; but these have no relation to the subject of the Animali Parlαηti. One of them, entitled Della Gatta e del Topo, written, we believe, before the author was poet-laureate, and published certainly after he had resigned that situation, is supposed to portray those sinister events which clouded the prospects of aggrandizement anticipated by Joseph from his formidable league with Russia against the Turks.\n",
      "Casti having completed his great work of the Anirnαli Parianti, anew directed his attention to the composition and publication of poetical novels. As far back as the year 1778 he had written eighteen of these Novelle Culanti, but his poetical avocations at the imperial court had interrupted his progress; and meanwhile those which he had composed were surreptitiously printed, both in Italy and France, in a manner so inaccurate, and so much altered from the way in which they had been originally written, that they could scarcely be recognised by the author, as we learn from the Protesta dell Autοre.\n",
      "Molti vi son ehe senza mio permesso\n",
      "Sparser le mie novelle, e v’han eangiato\n",
      "Ordine, senso, e versi, e strofe; e spesso\n",
      "Mi fan dir cio ehe non ho mai pensato,\n",
      "Che appena ornai mi vi conosco io stesso.\n",
      "Some, too, as La Bella Circassa, and La Figlia che non ha Giudizio, which were not written by Casti, were added to these surreptitious publications:\n",
      "Saran belle e leggiadre poesie,\n",
      "Tutto quel ehe si vuol; ma non son mie.\n",
      "In these circumstances, the injured poet assiduously prepared himself to enlarge the number of his novels, and to collect the whole in an edition which might be printed under his own immediate superintendence. He was prevented, however, by his sudden death; but his novels, which, at the period of his decease, amounted to fortyeight, were published by one of his Parisian friends, in 3 vols. 8vo, 1804, accompanied by a prefatory memoir of the author. The practice of tale-writing, which commenced with the author of the Cento Novelle Anticlie, and was brought to such perfection by Boccaccio, had prevailed in Italy for nearly five hundred years before the age of Casti. The Italian novelists invariably copied from each other, and from those inexhaustible stores of fiction, the Fabliaux of the Trouveurs. But the merit of Casti does not consist in the invention of his stories, all of which are borrowed, but in being the first among his countrymen who has clothed these tales in a poetical garb. His novels are founded either on mythological stories, or on preceding Italian tales. To the first class belong Aurora, E Origine di Homa, Diana ed Endimione, Pľometeo e Pandora. Almost all the rest are poetical versions from Boccaccio, Mas-succio di Salerno, and other Italian novelists. The longest, La Papessa, which is divided into three parts, is founded on the old story of Pope Joan. These tales are much admired by the Italians for purity of language and harmony of versification, and they contain many ingenious and sarcastic reflections on the hypocrisy, errors, and vices of men in every age and condition of life. They are disfigured, however, by an unpardonable licentiousness, which is carried much farther than that of almost any of the prior novelists of Italy. Some of them also terminate rather flatly, and the octave stanza, in which they are all written, and which has a certain degree of heaviness, even in the hands of Arios\n",

      "walled with stone, and designed for residence as well as defence, are for the most part, according to Mr Grose, of no higher antiquity than the conquest; for although the Saxons, Romans, and even, according to some writers on antiquity, the ancient Britons, had castles built of stone, yet these were both few in number, and, at that period, through neglect or invasions, either destroyed or so much decayed that little more than their ruins remained. This is asserted by many of our historians and antiquaries, and assigned as a reason for the facility with which William the Norman made himself master of this country.\n",
      "This circumstance was not overlooked by so good a general as the conqueror; who, in order effectually to guard against invasions from without, as well as to awe his newly-acquired subjects, immediately began to erect castles all over the kingdom, and likewise to repair and augment the old ones. Besides, as he had parcelled out the lands of the English amongst his followers, they, to protect themselves from the resentment of the despoiled natives, built strongholds and castles on their estates. This caused a considerable increase of these fortresses; and the turbulent and unsettled state of the kingdom in the succeeding reigns served to multiply them prodigiously, every baron or leader of a party building a castle; insomuch that towards the latter end of the reign of King Stephen they amounted to the almost incredible number of 1115.\n",
      "As the feudal system gathered strength, these castles became the heads of baronies. Each castle was a manor; and its castellan, owner, or governor, the lord of that manor. Markets and fairs were directed to be held there; not only to prevent frauds in the king’s duties or customs, but also as these were esteemed places where the laws of the land were observed, and as such had a very particular privilege. But this good order did not last long; for the lords of castles began to arrogate to themselves a royal power, not only within their castles, but likewise in their environs; exercising judicature both civil and criminal, coining money, and arbitrarily seizing forage and provisions for the subsistence of their garrisons, which they afterwards demanded as a right. At length their insolence and oppression grew to such a pitch, that, according to William of Newbury, “there were in England as many kings, or rather tyrants, as lords of castles and Matthew Paris emphatically styles them nests of devils and dens of thieves. Castles were not solely in the possession of the crown and the lay barons, but even bishops had such fortresses; though it seems to have been contrary to the canons, from a plea made use of in a general council in favour of King Stephen, who had seized upon the strong castles of the Bishops of Lincoln and Salisbury. This prohibition, if such existed, was, however, very little regarded; and in the following reigns many strong places were held, and even defended, by the ecclesiastics; nor was greater obedience afterwards paid to a decree made by the pope at Viterbo, on the fifth of the kalends of June 1220, in which it was ordained that no person in England should keep in his hands more than two of the king’s castles.\n",
      "The licentious behaviour of the garrisons of these places having become intolerable, it was agreed, in the treaty between King Stephen and Henry II. when only Duke of Normandy, that all the castles built within a certain period should be demolished; in consequence of which many were actually rased, but not the number stipulated.\n",
      "The few castles in being under the Saxon government were probably, on occasions of war or invasion, garrisoned by the national militia, and at other times slightly guarded by the domestics of the princes or great personages who resided in them; but after the conquest, when all the estates were converted into baronies held by knight’s service, castle-guard, coming under that denomination, was among the duties to which particular tenants were made liable. From these services the bishops and abbots, who till the time of the Normans had held their lands in frank almoign, or free alms, were, by this new regulation, not exempted; they were not, however, like the laity, obliged to render personal service, it being sufficient that they provided fit and able persons to officiate in their stead. This was at first stoutly opposed by Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, who being obliged to find some knights to attend King William Rufus in his wars in W τ ales, complained of it as an innovation and infringement of the rights and immunities of the church.\n",
      "It was no uncommon thing for the conqueror and the kings of those days to grant estates to men of approved fidelity and valour, on condition that they should perform castle-guard in the royal castles, with a certain number of men, for some specified time; and sometimes they were likewise bound by their tenures to keep in repair and guard some particular tower or bulwark, as was the case at Dover Castle.\n",
      "In process of time these services were commuted for annual-rents, sometimes styled wardpenny, and waytsee, but commonly castle-guard rents, payable on fixed days, under prodigious penalties called sursizes. At Rochester, if a man failed in the payment of his rent of castle-guard on the feast of St Andrew, his debt was doubled every tide during the time for which the payment was delayed. These were afterwards restrained by an act of parliament made in the reign of King Henry VIII. and finally annihilated, with the tenures by knight’s service, in the time of Charles II. Such castles as were private property were guarded either by mercenary soldiers, or by the tenants of the lord or owner.\n",
      "Castles which belonged to the crown, or fell to it either by forfeiture or escheat, circumstances that frequently happened in the distracted reigns of the feudal times, were generally committed to the custody of some trusty person, who seems to have been indifferently styled governor and constable. Sometimes also they were put into the possession of the sheriff of the county, who often converted them into prisons. That officer was then accountable at the exchequer for the farm or produce of the lands belonging to the places intrusted to his care, as well as for all other profits; and he was likewise, in case of war or invasion, obliged to victual and furnish them with munitions out of the issues of his county, to which he was directed by writ of privy seal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The materials of which castles were built varied according to the places of their erection; but the manner of their construction seems to have been pretty uniform. The outside of the walls was generally built of the stones nearest at hand, laid as regularly as their shapes would admit; and the interior was filled up with the like materials, mixed with a great quantity of fluid mortar, which was called by the-workmen grout-work.\n",
      "The general shape or plan of these castles depended entirely on the caprice of the architects, or the form of the ground intended to be occupied; neither do they seem to have confined themselves to any particular figure in their towers; square, round, and polygonal oftentimes occurring in the original parts of the same building.\n",
      "The situation of the castles of the Anglo-Norman kings and barons was most commonly on an eminence, and near a river; a situation on several accounts eligible. The whole site of the castle, which was frequently of great extent and irregular figure, was surrounded by a deep and broad ditch, sometimes filled with water, and sometimes dry, called the fosse. Before the great gate was an outwork, called a barhacan or antemural, which was a strong high wall, surmounted with turrets, designed for the defence of the gate and drawbridge. On the inside of the ditch stood the wall of the castle, about eight or ten feet thick and between twenty and thirty feet high, with a parapet, and a kind of embrasures called crcηnels on the top. On this wall, at proper distances, were built square towers of two or three stories high, which served for lodging some of the principal officers of the proprietor of the castle, and for other purposes; and on the inside were erected lodgings for the common servants or retainers, granaries, storehouses, and other necessary offices. On the top of this wall, and on the flat roofs of these buildings, stood the defenders of the castle, when it was besieged, who thence discharged arrows, darts, and stones on the besiegers. The great gate of the castle stood in the course of this wall, and was strongly fortified with a tower on each side, and rooms over the passage, which was closed with thick folding doors of oak, often plated with iron, and with an iron portcullis or grate let down from above. Within this outward wall was a large open space or court, called, in the largest and most perfect castles, the outer bayle, or ballium, in which stood commonly a church or chapel. On the inside of this outer bayle was another ditch, wall, gate, and towers, inclosing the inner bayle or court, within which the chief tower or keep was built. This was a large square fabric, four or five stories in height, having small windows in prodigiously thick walls, which rendered the apartments within it dark and gloomy. This great tower was the palace of the prince, prelate, or baron, to w h0m the castle belonged, and the residence of the constable or governor. Under ground were dismal dark vaults, for the confinement of prisoners, and sometimes called the dungeon or donjon. In this building also was the great hall, in which the owner displayed his hospitality, by entertaining his numerous friends and followers. At one end of the great halls of castles, palaces, and monasteries, there was a place raised a little above the rest of the floor, called the dais, where the chief table stood, at which persons of the highest rank dined. Though there were unquestionably great variations in the structure of castles, yet the m\n",

Its form is nearly circular, with the exception of the barony of Tullaghagh, which projects in a northwestern direction between the two first named of the surrounding counties. It lies nearly in the centre of Ireland, midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Irish Sea, its extremities being less than eighteen miles from either of these waters. According to the latest and most accurate calculation, its contents are estimated at 473,450 acres, or 740 square miles.\n",
      "The most ancient geographers speak of it as being inhabited by the tribe of the Erdini. At the period of the arrival of the English, and for some centuries afterwards, it was known by the name of the Brennie, Brennie O’Reylie, or O’Reylie’s country. Under a commission issued by James I. for the subdivision of the county, it was portioned out into seven baronies, two of which were assigned to Sir John O’Reylie, three to his brother, uncle, and the representatives of another of the family, while the two remaining baronies, possessed by the septs of M‘Rernon and M‘Gaurol, being remote, and bordering on O’Rorke’s country, now the county of Leitrim, were allowed to continue subject to the exactions of the Irish lords, the crown reserving two hundred beeves upon the whole county for the lord-deputy’s provision. There was also an ancient subdivision of the county into small portions called polls, each containing twenty-four acres. It is now divided into the baronies of Castleraghan, Clonkee, Clonmaghon, Upper and Lower Loughtee, Tullaghgarvey, Tullaghagh, and Tullaghonoho. At present the county rates are levied according to a peculiar measurement. A certain number of town lands are united under the name of a carvagli, of which each barony contains a thousand, making eight thousand carvaghs for the whole county. Hence, if these were all of an equal size, which is not the case, as they vary with the superficial contents of their respective baronies, each would contain something less than sixty acres.\n",
      "The county, according to its civil arrangements, under which the local taxes are levied, eontains twenty-nine parishes, besides four parts of parishes, the remaining parts of which are in the adjoining counties, three in Meath, and one in Fermanagh; but, according to its ecclesiastical arrangement, into thirty-three, of which twenty-nine are in the diocese of Kilmorc, three in that of Ardagh, and one in that of Meath. The bishopric of Kilmorc extends over the whole of the county. The seat of the see is at Kilmore, a small town nearly in the centre of Cavan. According to the latest return made to parliament, the see lands amounted to 47,361 acres, but no statement was then sent in as to the pecuniary value of the see.\n",
      "The population was estimated by Beaufort in 1792 at 81,570 souls; in 1813, according to the imperfect census then taken, it was supposed to be 164,000; in 1821, by the census of that year, it amounted to 195,076; and, according to the late but imperfect census of 1831, it was 228,050, giving an increase, in forty years, of 146,480 souls, or nearly double of its amount at the earliest of these dates.\n",
      "The county sends two representatives to the imperial parliament. Before the union it sent six, two for the county, and two each for the towns of Cavan and Bel turbet.\n",
      "The surface of the country is very uneven, consisting altogether of hills and valleys, without any level ground. The hills rise to a considerable elevation in the interior. The highest land in the county is the mountain of Slieve Russel, in the barony of Tullaghagh, on the confines of Fermanagh. In the same barony is Quilca Mountain, which is held in great veneration by the inhabitants, who relate many traditionary fables connected with the ancient superstitions of the country. It was also the place for installing the M‘Guires, the chieftains of Fermanagh.\n",
      "The valleys arc, in many parts, the receptacles of lakes, which, though not of very extended dimensions, arc objects of much interest, from the picturesque beauties of their scenery. Lough Ramor, one of the largest, is in the southern extremity of the county, near Virginia. It contains several islands, once well wooded, but now mostly bare. Lough Gawnagh, in the south-west, may be considered rather as a boundary between Cavan and Fermanagh, than as exclusively belonging to cither county. The same observation applies to Lough Shillin. Lough Ough-ter lies between the towns of Cavan and Killeshandra. Though not of very imposing dimensions, the irregularity of its form, the large and beautiful islands imbedded in its waters, and the many deep recesses studded with overhanging woods that wind among its high banks, produce a rich variety of prospect. The interest excited by its natural beauties is augmented by a circumstance of historical notoriety. Bishop Bedel, when taken prisoner during the civil wars of 1641, was confined in Cloghoughter, one of its islands. The castle, which was used as the prison of this venerable prelate, is still pointed out to strangers. Becleľs remains were deposited in Kihnore church. 'The most remarkable of the smaller lakes, which are to be met with in most parts of the county, is Lough Swillan, in the neighbourhood of Shercock, it being considered by many as the principal source of the river Erne. According to others, this river, the largest in the county, derives its origin from the Lake of Scrabo, one of the minor sheets of water that form Lough Gawnagh. The river itself takes a northerly direction by Killcshandra and Belturbet, being enlarged during its course by the Croghan, Ballyhayes, Annalee, and other streams. It enters Lough Erne at its most southern extremity, passes through it, and discharges itself into the Atlantic at Ballyshannon, in the county of Donegal. Woodside River, which skirts the county on the side of Fermanagh, falls into Lough Erne at the same place. The Shannon is said by some topographers to take its rise in Quilca Mountain, under the name of the Owenmore, which it changes for its more celebrated appellation on its junction with the Doubally, at the point where it enters the county of Leitrim, a few miles before it discharges its united streams into Lough Allen.\n",
      "The climate of this county is chilly, and the weather often boisterous, particularly in the mountainous districts. The soil is a stiff wet clay, cold and spongy, producing a coarse rushy pasturage, beneath which is usually a thick stratum of brown clay, resting upon a heavy yellow argillaceous substratum. The soil is much improved by draining, for which its undulating surface affords great facilities, and by gravelling or liming. Limestone is scarce in some districts, yet much sought after; so that it is at times drawn from distances of ten or twelve miles. In other parts, particularly throughout the baronies of Castleraghan, Clonkee, and Clonmoghan, marl, which is met with very generally, is preferred to lime, as the latter forms hard lumps when mixed with the clay soil, while the former renders the soil loose and friable. A very fine kind of manure, formed of decayed limestone, is found in the mountainous parts of Tullaghagh. In the banks of rivers it is in great plenty; and about a mile from Swadlingbar there is a large pile of it, which, when used judiciously, produces most luxuriant crops.\n",
      "Bog of the best quality, the red ashes of which form an excellent manure, is abundant. The upper part next the surface is dense and close, and makes the best fuel; that immediately under is friable, and therefore less valued as fuel. The bottom is solid and serviceable. In the moorish bogs, in which argillaceous strata are met with throughout the peat, marl abounds, and is very easily raised.\n",
      "A rich iron ore was raised from Quilca Mountain, and long wrought with considerable profit. The ore was smelted at Swadlingbar, where mills were erected for the purpose; but the works were ultimately relinquished, in con-quence of the failure of timber for fuel. At Ortnacullagh, near Ballyconnel, fragments of lead and silver ore are carried down the stream. Pure sulphur is also found there. In this and in other parts of Tullaghagh barony, fullers’ earth, pipe-clay, potters’ clay, and brick-clay, are frequently met with. Fine white and red transparent spars have also been occasionally picked up near Fermanagh. There are indications of coal in Lugnaguilla, the most north-western point of the county. It is also said that this mineral has been found in the mountain of Slieve Russel, where it has been dug out of the side of the hill in blocks near the surface. Another vein is said to exist at Glasleek, near Shercock, of a very sulphureous quality, burning well, and emitting a bright blue flame.\n",
      "These indications of minerals are accompanied with their usual concomitants, mineral springs. The most remarkable is that of Swadlingbar, which has long maintained a high character for its efficacy in restoring debilitated constitutions. Its predominant ingredient is sulphur. Near the same village there is a chalybeate spring. The small lake of Lough Leighs, or Lough-an-Leighaghs, which signifies the healing lake, on the summit of a mountain between Bailieborough and Kingscourt, is celebrated for its antiscorbutic qualities. Its waters are used for drinking and bathing; but the most beneficial effects are said to be produced by the mud raised from the bottom of it being rubbed on the diseased part. The level of the lake never varies. It has no visible supply nor vent for its discharge; neither is it ever frozen or changed in temperature during the severest winters. The water at the surface is clear; but within a foot downwards it becomes clogged with mud, which thickens as the lake descends, to a depth hitherto unascertained. The mud is drawn up for medical purposes from a depth of thirty feet, by means of \n",

      "de Tubieres, de Grimoard, de Pestels, de Levi, Count de, Marquis d’Esternay, Baron de Bransac, was born at Paris in October 1692. He was the eldest of the two sons of John Count de Caylus, lieutenant-general of the armies of the king of France, and of the marchioness de Villctte. His father and mother were very careful of the education of their son. The former instructed him in the profession of arms and in bodily exercises; the latter watched over and fostered the virtues of his mind, and this delicate task she discharged with singular success. The countess was the aunt of Madame de Maintenon, and remarkable alike for the solidity of her understanding and the charms of her wit. She was the author of the agreeable book entitled, The Recollections of Madame de Caylus, of which Voltaire published an elegant edition. The amiable qualities of the mother appeared in the son, but they appeared with a bold and military air. In his natural temper he was gay and sprightly, having a taste for pleasure, a strong passion for independence, and an invincible aversion to the servitude of a court. Count de Caylus was only twelve years of age when his father died at Brussels in 1704. After finishing his exercises, he entered into the corps of the Mousquetaires; and in his first campaign, in the year 1709, he distinguished himself so much by his valour, that Louis XIV. commended him before all the court, and rewarded him with an ensigncy in the gens-d'armerie. In 1711 he commanded a regiment of dragoons, which was called by his own name, and signalized himself at the head of it in Catalonia. In 1713 he was present at the siege of Fribourg, where he was exposed to imminent danger in the bloody attack of the covered way. The peace of Rastadt having left him in a state of inactivity ill suited to his natural temper, his vivacity soon led him to travel into Italy; and his curiosity was greatly excited by the wonders of that country, where antiquity is still fruitful, and produces so many objects to improve the taste and to excite the admiration. After a year’s absence, he returned to Paris with so strong a passion for travelling and for antiquities, that he resolved to quit the army, and to devote himself entirely to these pursuits.\n",
      "He had no sooner left the service of Louis than he set out for the Levant; and, having arrived at Smyrna, proceeded to Constantinople, where he made some stay. FIe next visited Greece, and other countries of the East rich in historical recollections or in ancient monuments; exposed himself to fatigue, the inclemency of the weather, contagion, and even the cupidity of brigands, in order to gratify his desire of knowledge; visited the ruins of Ephesus, including those of Colophon and the temple of Diana, under the escort of robbers belonging to a troop or band called Caracayali; returned to Byzantium by the Dardanelles; and lastly repaired to Adrianople, where the sultan, Mustapha I1., then resided. But in February 1717 he was recalled from the East by the tenderness of his mother. From that time he only left France to make two excursions to London. The Academy of Painting and Sculpture admitted him as an honorary member in the year 1731; and the count, whose ambition it was to deserve such a distinction, spared neither his labour, his credit, nor his fortune, to instruct, assist, and animate the artists. Hc wrote the lives of the most celebrated painters and engravers who had done honour to this illustrious academy; and, in order to extend the limits of the art, he collected, in three different works, new subjects for painting which he had met with in the works of the ancients.\n",
      "Such was his passion for antiquity, that he wished to have had it in his power to bring the whole of it to life again. He saw with regret that the works of the ancient painters were effaced and destroyed almost as soon as they were drawn from the subterranean mansions where they had been buried. But a fortunate accident furnished him with the means of showing the composition and the colour ing of the pictures of ancient Rome. The coloured drawings which Pietro S. Bartoli had taken there from antique pictures happening to fall into his hands, he had-them engraved; and, before he enriched the king of France’s cabinet with this production, he published an edition of it at his own expense. It is perhaps the most extraordinary book of antiquities that ever will appear, the whole being painted with a purity and precision which are altogether inimitable. There were only thirty copies published, and there is no reason to expect that there will hereafter be any more.\n",
      "Count de Caylus was at the same time engaged in an enterprise not less illustrative of Roman greatness, and still more interesting to the French nation. Colbert had formed the design of engraving the Roman antiquities which are still to be seen in the southern provinces of France; and by his orders Mignard the architect had made drawings of them, which Count de Caylus had the good fortune to recover. FIe therefore resolved to finish the work begun by Colbert, and to dedicate it to that great minister; and so much had he this enterprise at heart, that he was employed in it during his last illness, and warmly recommended it to Μ. Mariette.\n",
      "In 1742 Count Caylus was admitted as an honorary member of the Academy of Belles Lettres; and then it was that lie seemed to have found the place for which nature designed him. The study of literature now became his ruling passion; he consecrated to it his time and his fortune; lie even renounced his pleasures to give himself wholly up to the object of making some discovery in the field of antiquity. But amidst the fruits of his research and invention nothing afforded him so much gratification as his discovery of encaustic painting. A description of Pliny, too concise to give a clear view of the matter to an ordinary reader, suggested the idea of this art to Μ. de Caylus. He availed himself of the friendship and skill of Μ. Magault, a physician in Paris, and an excellent chemist; and by repeated experiments discovered the secret of incorporating wax with various tints and colours, and of rendering it manageable with the pencil. Pliny has made mention of two kinds of encaustic painting practised by the ancients, one of which was executed with wax on various substances, and the other upon ivory with hot punches of iron. It was the former kind, however, that Count de Caylus had the merit of reviving; and Μ. Muntz afterwards made many experiments in order to carry it to perfection.\n",
      "In the hands of Count Caylus, literature and the arts lent each other mutual aid. But it would be endless to give an account of all his works. He published above forty dissertations in the Memoirs of the Academy of Belles-Lettres. To the artists he was particularly attentive; and in order to prevent their falling into mistakes from ignorance of eostume, which the ablest of them have sometimes done, he founded a prize of five hundred livres, the object of whieh was to explain, by means of authors and monuments, the usages of aneient nations. In order that he might enjoy with the whole world the treasures which he had collected, he eaused them to be engraved, and gave a learned description of them in a work whieh he embellished with eight hundred copperplates.\n",
      "The strength of his constitution seemed to give him hopes of a long life; but a humour settling in one of his legs, entirely destroyed his health, and he expired on the 5th of September 1765. His character is thus drawn by a Freneh biographer:—“A severe probity, a rooted aversion to flattery, great indifference about honours, a singular simplicity, perhaps sometimes a little despotism in his opinions, formed the basis of his character. In him young artists found both a guide and a friend; and with a discernment and a delicacy still more rare than generosity, he anticipated the wants of those whose progress would have been otherwise retarded by the narrowness of their means. Naturally beneficent, he sometimes amused himself when he met a pauper whose appearance indicated probity, by giving him a louis to get changed, and then concealing himself where he could enjoy the poor creature’s embarrassment when the person from whom he received the gold was not to be found. Caylus, indeed, never knew any other luxury than that of liberality. His dress, in particular, was so plain that, having onc day stopped before a shop on whieh a sign-painter was painting a figure of St Franeis, the latter, taking him for one of his eomrades, asked his opinion respecting the work, whieh Caylus instantly gave him, and which delighted the painter so much, that he put the pallet and pencil into the hand of his new acquaintance, and begged him to retouch the picture. Caylus mounted the ladder, and having succeeded to the entire satisfaction of the painter, the latter wished to take him to a neighbouring tavern, when the carriage of the Count arrived, and his footman opened the door for his master. The painter of saints and signs was stupefied with astonishment; but Caylus, taking him by the hand, said, Au revoir, camarade, ce sera pour la première fois que nous nous rencontrerons.\"\n",
      "The numerous literary works of Count Caylus may be divided into three classes; humorous pieees and romances; productions relative to the fine arts; and those whieh treat exclusively of antiquities. I. The first elass consists of, 1. Les Eccosseuses,ou les OEufs de Pâques, Troyes, 1739et1745, 12mo; 2. Histoire de Guillaume, cocher, 12mo; 3. Féeries Nozιvdles, Paris, 1742, 2 vols. 12mo; 4. Soirées du Bois de Boulogne, Paris, 1742, 12mo; 5. Etrennes de la St Jean, in conjunction with Moncrieff, Crebillon the younger, Duelos, La Chaussé, Voisenon, and others; 6. Contes Orientaux, 1743,12mo; 7. Histoire de Mlle. Cronel, dite Frxtillon {Mlle. Clairon), Paris 1743, 12mo; 8. Histoires Nouvelles et Mémoires ramassés, Paris, 1743; 9.

      "among divines, one of the three grand theological virtues, consisting in the love of God and of our neighbour, or the habit and disposition of loving God with all our heart, and our neighbour as ourselves.\n",
      "Charity is also used for the effect of moral virtue, which consists in supplying the necessities of others, whether with money, counsel, assistance, or the like.\n",
      "As pecuniary relief is generally the most effieaeious kind of eharity, and at the same time that from whieh men are most ant to exeuse themselves, this braneh of the duty merits particular illustration; and a better cannot be offered than that whieh is contained in the Moral Philosophy of Archdeacon Paley.\n",
      "Whether pity be an instinct or a habit, it is in faet a property of our nature which God has appointed; and the final cause for whieh it was appointed is to afford to the miserable, in the compassion of their fellow-creatures, a remedy for those inequalities and distresses which God foresaw that many must be exposed to under every general rule for the distribution of property.\n",
      "The Christian Scriptures are more copious and explicit upon this duty than almost any other. The description which Christ has left us of the proceedings of the last day establishes beyond controversy the obligation of bounty. “When the Son of Man shall eome in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye elothed me; I was sick, an. ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me. And inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” It is not necessary to understand this passage as a literal aceount of what will actually pass on that day. Supposing it only a seenieal description of the rules and principles by which the Supreme Arbiter of our destiny will regulate his deeisions, it eonveys the same lesson to us. It equally demonstrates of how great value and importance are these duties in the sight of God, and what stress will be laid upon them. The apostles also describe this virtue as propitiating the divine favour in an eminent degree. And these recommendations have produced their effect. It does not appear that before the times of Christianity an infirmary, hospital, or public eharity of any kind, existed in the world; whereas most countries in Christendom have long abounded with these institutions. To this it may be added, that a spirit of private liberality seems to flourish amidst the deeay of many other virtues; not to mention the legal provision for the poor, whieh obtains in our i country, and which was unknown and unthought of by the most polished nations of antiquity.\n",
      "St Paul adds upon this subject an excellent direction, which is practicable by all who have any thing to give. “Upon the first day of the week (or any other stated time) let every one of you lay by in store, as God hath prospered him.” By this the apostle may be understood to reeommend what is the very thing wanting with most men, the being charitable upon a plan ; that is, from a deliberate eomparison of our fortunes with the reasonable expenses and expectations of our families, to compute what we ean spare, and to lay by so mueh for ehàritable purposes, in some mode or other. The mode will be a consideration afterwards.\n",
      "The effects whieh Christianity produced upon some of its converts were such as might fie looked for from a divine religion coming with full force and miraeulous evidence upon the eonseienees of mankind. It overwhelmed all worldly considerations, in the expectation of a more important existence. “And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul; neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his. own, but they had all things in common. Neither was there any among them that lacked; for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles’ feet; and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.”\n",
      "Nevertheless, this community of goods, however it mani-rested the sincere zeal of the primitive Christians, is no precedent for our imitation. It was eonfined to the ehureh at Jerusalem; continued not long there; was never enjoined upon any; and, although it might suit the particular circumstances of a small and select society, is altogether impracticable in a large and mixed community.\n",
      "The conduet of the apostles upon the occasion deserves to be noticed. Their followers laid down their fortunes at their feet; but so far were they from taking advantage of this unlimited confidence to enrieh themselves or establish their authority, that they soon afterwards got rid of this business as inconsistent with the main objeet of their mission, and transferred the custody and management of the public fund to deacons elected to that office by the people at large.\n",
      "There are three kinds of charity whieh prefer elaims respectively to attention.\n",
      "1. The first, and apparently one of the best, is to give stated and considerable sums, by way of pension or annuity, to individuals or families with whose behaviour and distress we are ourselves acquainted. In speaking of considerable sums, it is meant only, that five pounds, or any other sum, given at once, or divided amongst five or fewer families, will do more good than the same sum distributed amongst a greater number in shillings or half crowns; and that, because it is more likely to be properly applied by the persons who receive it. A poor fellow who can find no better use for a shilling than to drink his benefactor’s health, and purchase half an hour’s recreation for himself, would hardly break into a guinea for any such purpose, or be so improvident as not to lay it by for an occasion of importance, for his rent, his clothing, fuel, or stock of winter's provision. It is a still greater recommendation of this kind of eharity, that pensions and annuities, which are paid regularly, and ean be expected at the time, are the only way by whieh we ean prevent one part of a poor man’s sufferings, the dread of want.\n",
      "2. But as this kind of eharity supposes that proper objects of such expensive benefactions fall within our private knowledge and observation, whieh does not happen to all, a second method of doing good, whieh is in every one’s power who has the money to spare, is by subscription to public charities. Publie charities admit of this argument in their favour, that the money goes farther towards attaining the end for which it is given, than it can do by any private and separate beneficence. A guinea, for example, contributed to an infirmary, becomes the means of providing one patient, at least, with a physieian, surgeon, apothecary, with medicine, diet, lodging, and suitable attendance; whieh is not the tenth part of what the same assistance, if it could be procured at all, would cost to a siek person or family in any other situation.\n",
      "3. The last, and, compared with the former, the lowest exertion of benevolence, is in the relief of beggars. Nevertheless, the indiscriminate rejection of all who implore our alms in this way is by no means to be approved. Some may perish by such a conduct. Men are occasionally overtaken by distress, for whieh all other relief would eome too late; and besides, resolutions of this kind compel us to offer sueh violence to our humanity, as may go near, in a little while, to suffoeate the principle itself; whieh is a very serious consideration. A good man, if he do not surrender himself to his feelings without reserve, will at least lend an ear to importunities whieh are accompanied with outward attestations of distress; and, after a patient hearing of the eomplaint, will direct himself by the circumstances and credibility of the account he receives.\n",
      "The pretences by which men excuse themselves from giving to the poor are various; as,\n",
      "1. That they have nothing to spare·, that is, nothing for whieh they have not some other use; nothing which their plan of expense, together with the savings they have resolved to lay by, will not exhaust: never refleeting whether it be in their power, or that it is their duty, to retrench their expenses, and contract their plan, “that they;may have to give to them that need or rather that this ought to have been part of their plan originally.\n",
      "2. That they have families of their own, and that charity begins at home. A father is no doubt bound to adjust his economy with a view to the reasonable demands of his family upon his fortune; and until a sufficiency for these is acquired, or will be in due time probably acquired (for in human affairs probability is enough), he is justified in declining expensive liberality; for to take from those who want, in order to give to those who want, adds nothing to the stock of public happiness. Thus far, therefore, and no farther, the plea in question is an excuse for parsimony, and an answer to those who solieit our bounty.\n",
      "3. That charity docs not consist in giving money, but in benevolence, philanthropy, love to all manhind, goodness of heart, and the like. But hear St James: “If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwithstanding ye give them not those things which arc needful for the body, what doth it profit?”\n",
      "4. That giving to the poor is not mentioned in St Paul’s description of charity, in the thirteenth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians. This is not a description of charity, but of good nature; and it is not necessary that every duty\n",

      "The republic of Chili is situated on the western coast of South America, between the Cordillera of the Andes and the Pacific Ocean. On its eastern side the lofty chain of the Andes separates it from the Argentine republic, while the ocean forms its western boundary. To the north its boundary is formed by the river Salado in the desert of Atacama, the northern part of which country is alone inhabited. On the south Chili is bounded by the river Biobio, which separates it from a fine country, inhabited by the Araucanian Indians. There are, however, other territorial possessions of importance, which form an integral part of the Chilian republic, although not contiguous to that part which has been already alluded to, but somewhat insulated. The province or rather fortress of Valdivia, which is situated on the coast of the Pacific, in the Araucanian country, is principally valuable on account of its excellent harbour for shipping, and its admirable military position. To the south of the Araucanian country are situated the archipelago or islands of Chiloc, about eighty in number, and producing many valuable articles of consumption and export. The beautiful and fertile island of La Mocha is situated on the Araucanian coast; those of Quiriquina and Santa Maria, near Conception, and the two islands of Juan Fernandez, lie much farther to the north, but at a greater distance from the coast.\n",
      "The territory of Chili, therefore, independent of its detached possessions, extends from 25° 30 ’ to 37° 25' of south latitude, and from 69° 40' to 74° of west longitude; and its superficies may be estimated at about 23,000 square leagues. The country which formerly constituted a part of Chili extends from the Biobio to the 42d degree of south latitude, and is inhabited by the Araucanian, Clinches, and Huilliches Indians. This country was at one period held in military possession by the Spaniards, who constructed numerous forts, and some large and opulent cities; but they were at length driven from the country by the efforts of the natives, and no traces now remain of these establishments. The archipelago of Chiloe commences where this territory ends, being only separated from it by an arm of the sea, and extends to 44° south latitude.\n",
      "The colossal chain of the Cordillera of the Andes, which; separates the Chilian from the Argentine provinces, runst in nearly a parallel direction with the coast of the Pacific Ocean, the breadth of the intervening country varying from 80 to 200 miles. The greatest elevation of these mountains cannot exceed 17,000 feet above the level of the ocean, as snow can only be seen during the whole year in one or two very limited stations, except where sheltered by situation from the influence of the direct rays of the sun. In the southern hemisphere, the same laws do not appear to determine the line of perpetual snow as in the northern; for observation proves that this line is much higher in the corresponding latitudes of the former. On the other hand, an idea of its least elevation may be formed from the observations of the writer, who has traversed this chain in four different latitudes, and carefully measured the height of the passes by means of barometrical observations. He found the eastern or metalliferous range, called Paramillo de Uspallata, which separates the extensive valley of Uspallata from the plains of Mendoza, to possess an elevation of from 9500 to 10,000 feet; and the Cumbre, or central ridge, intervening between the valleys of the rivers Mendoza and Aconcagua, on the Uspallata road, to be 12,532 feet, the intervening valley of Uspallata being 6141 feet. By the Pass of the Portillo two lofty ridges are also crossed, the one named El Portillo, of 14,360; and the other El Portillo de los Peuquenes, of 13,310 feet in height. From these the road leads into the valley of the river Maypu, and the elevation of the intervening valley of theTenuvan is 7530 feet. Between these two routes is situated the lofty mountain of Tupungato, in latitude 33° 24' south, and nearly between the cities of Mendoza and Santiago. It seems to be the highest of this part of the Andes, as it is the first of the Chilian Andes which becomes visible on the road from Buenos Ayres. In favourable weather, about sunset, it is visible from the plaza of San Luis de la Punta, distant eighty-two leagues east of Mendoza, and having an elevation above the sea of 2417 feet. Although during certain periods of the year no snow is visible on its summit from Mendoza, yet snow is known to exist there at all seasons, as the supplies for the use of the Mendozinos is derived from that source. To the south of the passes of the Portillo and Peuquenes is situated the volcanic mountain of Peuquenes or Maypu, which has experienced a number of eruptions of ashes since the earthquake of 1822. To the south of the volcano is situated the Pass of the Cruz de Piedra, which unites with the preceding in the valley of the Maypu. Farther south a route little frequented unites the valleys of the rivers Diamante and Cachapoal; and to the south of this is found the volcano of Peteroa. The Pass of the Damas, to the south of this volcano, is situated between the valley of the river Atuel on the east, and that of the river Tinguiririca on the west, which issues from the mountains at San Fernando. The highest lands traversed by this route are El Llano de los Morros, of 11,651, and El Llano de los Choicos, of 10,172 feet of elevation. The route by the Planchon joins the preceding on the eastern side, at the Atuel, and descends to Curico in Chili, by the valleys of the rivers Claro and Teno. Its highest part, the Planchon, although from an accidental circumstance it was not measured, cannot exceed 10,000 feet in height, if an opinion may be formed from the comparative state of its vegetation. The celebrated mountain El Descabezado, or Blauquillo, in 35° south latitude, was visible at some distance to the south of the Planchon, but no traces of snow could be seen. On the summit of this mountain there is an extensive plain of six miles diameter, with a deep lake in the centre, supposed to be an extinct volcano; likewise a variety of fossil shells—an occurrence by no means uncommon at this great elevation, as similar fossil remains have been found in abundance at the Puente del Inga, on the Uspallata route to Chili, at an elevation of 8654 feet above the sea. Proceedingsouthward from these points, the passes of the Andes become more frequent and accessible, and less elevated, until they reach the Straits of Magellan. On the northwest side of the Pass of the Cumbre, on theUspallata route, is situated a mountain, called the Volcan de Aconcagua, to the north of which are the passes of Los Patos and Puta-endo, so celebrated as the route by which General San Martin conveyed his army across the Andes for the liberation of Chili. There are only two well-known and frequented passes across the Andes to Chili north of this place; the one being a communication between the city of San Juan and Coquimbo and the other from La Rioja to Coquimbo and Copiapo.\n",
      "In the Chilian territory which intervenes between the Cordillera of the Andes and the Pacific there are found various parallel mountainous ranges, but of much less elevation. These are evidently offsets from the principal chain, as the lines of communication can easily be traced in many places. In the latitude of the capital of Chili, Santiago, and the port of Valparaiso, the intervening longitudinal ridges are three in number, which decrease in height as they approach the ocean; namely, La Cuesta del Prado, 2543; La Cuesta de Zapata, 1850; and La Cuesta de Valparaiso, 1261 feet; the intervening valleys of Santiago, Curicavi, and Casa Blanca, being 1700, 1560, and 743 feet above the level of the Pacific Ocean.\n",
      "All these ranges of mountains are intersected in many places by valleys, which run nearly east and west, and convey the waters of the numerous streams which flow from the Cordillera, and intervening country, towards the ocean. These valleys, and the still more spacious and extensive ones which intervene between the parallel mountainous ridges, constitute the parts of the country which are best suited for the purposes of agriculture, and consequently contain the principal population. In the northern provinces, however, rivers and streams for the purposes of irrigation are essential to the existence of agriculture and population, as it rains so seldom and so sparingly that no useful produce can otherwise bc obtained.\n",
      "The rivers of Chili are numerous, but, with few exceptions, of small size, as they run only from the Andes to the Pacific^ and have therefore a very limited course. They are rapid in their course, until they reach the level country. In the early months of spring and summer they swell considerably, from the melting of the snows; and their daily increase and decrease is easily calculated by the inhabitants, according to the distance of the place from the snowy summits whence originate the cause of increase during the days when the sun’s rays are powerful. The principal rivers are, the Biobio, which forms the southern boundary; it is about two miles broad at its mouth, and is navigable for rafts and small craft as high as Nacimiento, and on it are conveyed to Conception the valuable productions of its banks. The 1tata, also of considerable size, traverses the provinces of Conception and a tract of country abounding in corn and wine. The Maule is navigable for small vessels, and runs through a rich and fertile country, abounding in cattle and excellent timber, especially rohle and lingui. The harbour at its mouth is capacious and well sheltered, but does not admit vessels drawing more than eleven feet of water, owing to a bar of sand crossing the mouth of the river. The Teno and Lontue unite below Curico to form the Mataquita, and divide the provinces of Maule and Colchagua; which last is bounded on the north by the Cach\n",

      "however, are, in Professor Beckmann’s opinion, of comparatively modern origin; and in order to show the ground upon which he comes to this conclusion, we shall lay before our readers some observations from his elaborate dissertation on this subject.\n",
      "When the triumviri, says Appian, caused those who had been proscribed by them to be sought for by the military, some of them, in order to avoid the bloody hands of their persecutors, hid themselves in wells, and others, as Ferrarius translates the words, in fumaria sub tecto, qua scilicet fumus e tecto evolvitur. The true translation, however, in Beckmann's opinion, is fumosa coenacula. The principal persons of Rome endeavoured to conceal themselves in the smoky apartments of the upper story under the roof, which, in general, were inhabited only by poor people; and this seems to be confirmed by what Juvenal expressly says, Parus venit in ccenacula miles.\n",
      "Those passages of the ancients which speak of smoke rising up from houses, have with equal impropriety been supposed to allude to chimneys, as if the smoke eould not make its way through doors and windows. Seneea says, “Last evening I had some friends with me, and on that account a stronger smoke was raised; not such a smoke, however, as bursts forth from the kitehens of the great, and which alarms the watchmen, but sueh an one as signifies that guests have arrived.” Those whose judgments are not already warped by prejudice, will undoubtedly find the true sense of these words to be, that the smoke forced its way through the kitchen windows. Had the houses been built with chimney funnels, one cannot conceive why the watchmen should have been alarmed when they observed a stronger smoke than usual arising from them; but as the kitchens had no convenience of that nature, an apprehension of fire, when extraordinary entertainments were to be provided in the houses of the rich for large companies, seems to have been well founded; and on such occasions people appointed for that purpose were stationed in the neighbourhood, to be constantly on the watch, and to be ready to extinguish the flames in case a fire should happen. There are to be found in Roman authors many other passages of a similar kind, which it is hardly necessary to mention, such as that of Virgil,\n",
      "Et jam summa procul villarum culmina fumant; and the following words of Plautus, descriptive of a miser:\n",
      "Quin divûm atque hominum clamat continuo fidem,\n",
      "Suam rem periisse, seque eradicarier, De suo tigillo fumus si qua exit foras.\n",
      "The passage of Aristophanes above alluded to, however, and which, according to the usual translation, seems to refer to a common chimney, may, especially when we consider the illustration of the scholiasts, be explained by a simple hole in the roof, as Reiske has supposed; and indeed this appears to be the more probable, as we find mention made of a top or covering (τjjλ∕α) with which the hole was closed.\n",
      "It has been said that the instances of chimneys remaining among the ruins of ancient buildings are fcw, and that the rules given by Vitruvius for building them are obscure; but it appears that there exists no remains oí ancient chimneys, and that Vitruvius gives no rules, either obscure or perspicuous, for building what, in the modern acceptation of the word, deserves the name of a chimney The ancient mason-work still to be found in Italy does not determine the question. Of the walls of towns, temples, amphithcatres, baths, aqueducts, and bridges, there are some, though very imperfect remains, in which chimneys cannot be expected; but of common dwellinghouses none are to be seen, except at Herculaneum, and there no traces of chimneys have yet been discovered The paintings and pieces of sculpture which are preserver; afford as little information, for nothing can be perceived ir them which bears the smallest resemblance to a modern chimney.\n",
      "If there were no funnels in the houses of the ancients to carry off the smoke, the directions given by Columella, to make kitchens so high that the roof should not catch fire, were of the utmost importance. An accident of the kind, which the author seems to have apprehended, had almost happened at Beneventum, when the landlord whc entertained Maecenas and his company was making a strong fire in order to get some birds the sooner roasted.\n",
      "Ubi sedulus hospes\n",
      "Paene arsit, macros dum turdos versat in igne; Nam vaga per veterem dilapso flamma culinam Vulcano summum properabat, lambere tectam.\n",
      "Had there been chimneys in the Roman houses, Vitruvius certainly would not have failed to describe their construction, which is sometimes attended with considerable difficulties, and which is intimately connected with the regulation of the plan of the whole edifice. He does not, however, say a word on the subject; neither does Julius Pollux, who has collected with great care the Greek names of every part of a dwelling-house; and Grapaldus, who in later times made a collection of the Latin terms, has not given a Latin word expressive of a modern chimney.\n",
      "Caminus, as far as we have been able to lcarn, signified first a chemical or metallurgic furnace, in which a crucible was placed for melting and refining metals; secondly, a smith’s forge; and, thirdly, a hearth on which portable Stoves or fire-pans were placed for warming the apartment. In all these, however, there appears no trace of a chimney. Herodotus relates, that a king of Libya, when one of his servants asked for his wages, offered him in jest the sun, which at that time shone into the house through an opening in the roof, under which the fire was perhaps made in the middle of the edifice. If such a hole must be called a chimney, our author admits that chimneys were in use among the ancients, especially in their kitchens; but it is obvious that such chimneys bore no rcscmblance to ours, through which the sun could not dart his rays upon the floor of any apartment.\n",
      "However imperfect may be the information which can be collected from the Greek and Roman authors respecting the manner in which the ancients warmed their apartments, it nevertheless shows that they commonly used for that purpose a large fire-pan or portable stove, in which they kindled wood, and, when the wood was well lighted, carried it into the room, or perhaps they filled it with burning coals. When Alexander the Great was entertained by a friend in winter, as the weather was cold and raw, a small fire basin was brought into the apartment to warm it. The prince, observing the size of the vessel, and that it contained only a few coals, desired his host, in a jeering manner, to bring more wood or to fetch frankincense; giving him thus to understand that the fire was fitter for burning perfumes than to produce heat. Anacharsis, the Scythian philosopher, though displeased with many of the Grecian customs, praised the Greeks, because they shut out the smoke, and brought only fire into their houses.\n",
      "We are informed by Lampridius, that the extravagant Heliogabalus caused to be burned in such stoves, Indian\n",
      ", spices, and costly perfumes, instead of wood. It is also worthy of notice, that coals were found in some of the l apartments of Herculaneum, but neither stoves nor chim- , neys.\n",
      "It is well known to every scholar, that the useful arts of life were invented in the East; and that the customs, ' manners, and furniture of eastern nations, have remain- . ed from time immemorial almost unchanged. In Persia, I which Sir William Jones seems to have considered as ι the original country of mankind, the methods employed ι by the inhabitants for warming themselves have a great resemblance to those employed by the ancient Greeks and > Romans for the same purpose. According to De la Ville, l the Persians make fires in their apartments, not in chim-I neys as we do, but in stoves in the earth, which they call ; tennor. These stoves consist of a square or round hole, I two spans or a little more in depth, and in shape not un-\n",
      "• like an Italian cask. That this hole may throw out heat sooner, and with more strength, there is placed in it an iron vessel of the same size, which is either filled with burning coals, or a fire of wood and other inflammable substances is made in it. When this is done, they place over the hole or stove a wooden top, like a small low table, and spread above it a large coverlet quilted with cotton, which hangs down on all sides to the floor. This covering condenses the heat, and causes it to warm the whole apartment. The people who eat or converse there, and some who sleep in it, lie down on the floor upon the carpet, and lean with their shoulders against the wall, on square cushions, upon which they sometimes also sit; for the ien- * nor is constructed in a place equally distant from the walls on both sides. Those who are not very cold put their feet only under the table or covering; but those who require more heat may put their hands under it, or creep under it altogether. By these means the stove diffuses over the whole body, without causing uneasiness to the head, so penetrating and agreeable a warmth, that I never experienced any thing more pleasant. Those, however, who require less heat let the coverlet hang down on their side to the floor, and enjoy without any inconvenience from the stove the moderately-heated air of the apartment. They have a method also’of stirring up or blowing the fire when necessary, by means of a small pipe united with the tennor or stove under the earth, and made to project above the floor as high as is judged necessary; so that, when a person blows into it, the wind, having no other vent, acts immediately upon the fire like a pair of bellows. When there is no longer occasion to use this stove, both holes, that is to say, the mouth of the stove and that of the pipe which conveys the air to it, are closed up by a flat stone made for that purpose. Scarcely any appearance of them is then to be perceived, nor do they occasion inconvenience, especially in a country wher\n",

      "----\n",
      "the celebrated Roman orator, was born in the year of Rome 647, or about 105 years before Christ. His father Marcus Tullius, who was of the equestrian order, took great care of his education, which was directed particularly with a view to the bar. On his first appearance in public, young Tully declaimed with such vehemence against Sylla’s party, that it became expedient for him to retire into Greece, where he attended the Athenian orators and philosophers, and greatly improved both in eloquence and knowledge. Here he met with his school-fellow Titus Pomponius, who, from his love of Athens, and having spent a great part of his days in that city, obtained the surname of Atticus ; and here they revived and confirmed that noted friendship which subsisted between them through life with unshaken constancy and affection. From Athens Tully passed into Asia, and after an excursion of two years returned to Italy much improved by his travels.\n",
      "Cicero had now established himself at Rome, where, after one year more spent at the bar, he obtained the dignity of questor. Among the causes which hè pleaded before his questorshiρ, was that of the famous comedian Roscius, whom singular excellence in his art had recommended to the familiarity and friendship of the greatest men in Rome. The questors were the general receivers or treasurers of the republic,-and were sent annually into the provinces assigned them by lot. The island of Sicily happened to fall to Cicero's share, including that part of it,—for it was considerable enough to be divided into two provinces,— which was called Lilybaeum. The office of questor he received, not as a gift, but as a trust; and he acquitted himself so well in discharge of it, that he gained the love and admiration of all the Sicilians. Before he left Sicily, he made the tour of the island, in order to visit every thing curious, especially the city of Syracuse, at which place he pointed out the tomb of Archimedes to the magistrates, who were showing him the curiosities of the place; but, to his surprise, he found that they knew nothing either of the tomb or of him whose ashes it contained.\n",
      "We have no account of the precise time of Cicero’s marriage with Terentia; but it is supposed to have been celebrated immediately after his return from his travels to Italy, when he was about thirty. Being now disengaged from his questorship in Sicily, by which first step in the legal gradation and ascent of public honours he had gained an immediate right to the senate, and an actual admission into it during life, he again settled in Rome, where he employed himself constantly in defending the persons and properties of its citizens, and indeed became a general patron of causes. Five years had scarcely elapsed since Cicero’s election to the questorship (this being the proper interval prescribed by law before he could hold the next office), when he was, in his thirty-seventh year, elected aedile by the unanimous suffrages of the tribes, and in preference to all his competitors. After Cicero’s election to the aedileship, but before his entrance upon office, he undertook the famous prosecution of Verres, the late praetor of Sicily, who was charged with many flagrant acts of injustice, rapine, and cruelty, during his triennial government of that island. This was one of the most memorable transactions of his life, one for which he was greatly and justly celebrated by antiquity, and for which he will, in all ages, be admired and esteemed by the friends of mankind. The result was, that, by his diligence and address, he so confounded Hortensius, though the reigning orator at the bar, and usually styled the king of the forum, that his majesty had nothing to say for his client. Verres, despairing of all defence, submitted immediately, without waiting the sentence, to a voluntary exile, in which condition he lived many years, forgotten and deserted by all his friends. He is said to have been relieved in this miserable situation by the generosity of Cicero; but at length he was proscribed and murdered by Mark Antony, for the sake of those fine statues and Corinthian vessels of which he had plundered the Sicilians.\n",
      "After the usual interval of two years from the time of his being chosen aedile, Cicero offered himself as a candidate for the praetorship; and, in three different assemblies convened for the choice of praetors, two of which were dissolved without effect, he was every time declared the first praetor by the suffrages of the centuries. He was now in the full career of his fortunes, and in sight, as it were, of the consulship, the grand object of his ambition; and therefore, when his praetorship terminated, he refused to accept any foreign province, the usual reward of that magistracy, and the chief fruit which the generality proposed from it. He had no particular love for money, and no genius for war; so that those governments had no charms for him. The glory which he pursued was to shine in the eyes of the city as the guardian of its laws; to teach the magistrates how to execute, and the citizens how to obey them.\n",
      "Being now in his forty-third year, the proper age required by law, he declared himself a candidate for the consulship, along with six competitors, L. Sulpicius Galba, L. Sergius Catilina, C. Antonius, L. Cassius Longinus, Q. Cornificius, and C. Licinius Sacerdos. The first two were patricians; the next two plebeians, yet noble; the last two the sons of fathers who had first imported the public honours into their families; Cicero was the only new man, as he was called, among them, or person of the equestrian rank. These were the competitors; and in the competition the practice of bribing was carried on openly and shamefully by Antony and Catiline. However, as the election approached, Cicero’s interest appeared to be superior to that of all the candidates; for the nobles themselves, though always envious of and desirous to depress him, yet, considering the dangers which threatened the city from many quarters and seemed ready to burst out into a flame, they began to think him the only man qualified to preserve the republic, and to quash the cabals of the desperate, by the vigour and prudence of his administration. The method of choosing consuls was not by an open vote, but by a kind of ballot, or little tickets of wood distributed to the citizens, with the names of the several candidates inscribed upon each. But in Cicero’s case the people were not content with this secret and silent way. Before they came to any scrutiny, they loudly and universally proclaimed Cicero the first consul; so that, as he himself says, “he was not chosen by the votes of particular citizens, but by the common suffrage of the city; not declared by the voice of the crier, but by that of the whole Roman people.”\n",
      "Cicero had no sooner entered upon his office than he had occasion to exert himself against P. Servilius Rullus, one of the new tribunes, who had been alarming the senate with the promulgation of an agrarian law; the purpose of which was to create a decemvirate, or ten commissioners, with absolute power for five years over all the revenues of the republic, to distribute them at pleasure to the citizens, and to exercise other functions equally incompatible with the existence of society. These laws used to be greedily received by the populace, and were therefore proposed by factious magistrates as often as they had any point to carry with the multitude against the public good; so that Cicero’s first business was to quiet the apprehensions of the city, and to baffle, if possible, the intrigues of the tribune. Accordingly, in an artful and elegant speech from the rostra, he gave such a turn to the inclination of the people, that they rejected this law with as much eagerness as they had ever received one. But the affair which constituted the great glory of his consulship, and which has transmitted his name with such lustre to posterity, was the skill he showed, and the unwearied pains he took, in suppressing the conspiracy which had been formed by Catiline and his accomplices for the subversion of the commonwealth. For this great service he was honoured with the glorious title of Pater Patrice, or Father of his Country, a title which he retained for a long time afterwards.\n",
      "Cicero’s administration was now at an end; but he had no sooner quitted his office than he began to feel the effects of that envy which is the certain fruit of illustrious merit. He was now, therefore, the common mark, not only of all the factious, against whom he had declared perpetual war, but of another party not less dangerous, the envious, whose united malice never left him from this moment till they had driven him out of the very city which he had so lately preserved. Cicero, upon the expiration of his consulship, took care to send a particular account of his whole administration to Pompey, then occupied with the Mithridatic war in Asia; in hopes no doubt of preventing any wrong impressions there from the calumnies of his enemies, and of drawing from that commander some public declaration in favour of what had been done. But Pompey being informed by Metellus and Caesar of the ill humour which was rising up against Cicero in Rome, answered him with great coldness, and instead of paying him any compliment, took no notice at all of what had passed in the affair of Catiline; an omission in regard to which Cicero expostulates with him in a letter which is still extant.\n",
      "About this time Cicero bought a house of Marcus Crassus, on the Palatine Hill, adjoining to that in which he had always lived with his father, and which he is supposed to have given up to his brother Quintius. The house cost him a very large sum, and seems to have been one of the noblest in Rome. The purchase of so expensive a house led to some censure of his vanity, especially as it was effected with borrowed money; a circumstance which he himself does not dissemble, but observes jocosely, with referen\n",

      "----\n",
      "now in his sixty-first year, was at length forced to part with his wife Terentia, whose humour and conduct had long been disagreeable to him. She was a woman of an imperious and turbulent spirit; and though he had borne her perverseness in the vigour of health, and the prosperous state of his fortunes, yet, in declining life, and soured by a continual succession of mortifications from abroad, the want of ease and quiet at home became no longer tolerable to him. But he was immediately oppressed by a new and most cruel affliction, the death of his beloved daughter Tullia, who died in childbed soon after her divorce from her third husband Dolabella. She was about thirty-two years old at the time of her death; and, by the few hints which are left of her character, she appears to have been an excellent and admirable woman. She was most affectionately and piously attentive to her father, and, to the usual graces of her sex, added the more solid accomplishments of knowledge and polite letters, which qualified her to be the companion and delight of his age, and made her justly esteemed not only as one of the best, but the most learned, of thç Roman laxlies. His affliction for the death of this daughter was so great, that to shun all company as much as he could, he removed to Atticus’s house, where he lived chiefly in his library, turning over every book he could meet with on the subject of moderating grief. But finding his residence here too public, and being exposed to more society than he was able to bear, he retired to Astura, one of his seats near Antium; a little island on the Latian shore, at the mouth of a river of the same name, and covered with wood and groves cut into shady walks, forming a scene altogether the fittest to indulge melancholy, and to afford a free vent, to affliction. “Here,” says he to Atticus, “1 live without the speech of man. Every morning early I hide myself in the thickest of the wood, and never come out till the evening. Next to yourself, nothing is so dear to me as this solitude; and my whole conversation is with my books.” Indeed his whole time was employed in little else than reading and writing, during Caesar’s administration, which he could never cheerfully submit to; and it was within this period that he drew up one of the gravest of those philosophical pieces which are still extant in his works.\n",
      "Upon the death of Caesar, Octavius, his nephew and heir, coming into Italy, was presented to Cicero by Hirtius and Pansa, with the strongest professions on the part of the young man that he would be governed entirely by his direction. Indeed Cicero thought it necessary to cherish and encourage Octavius, if for nothing else, to keep him at a distance from Antony; but he could not yet be persuaded to enter heartily into his affairs. He suspected his youth and want of experience, and that he had not strength enough to deal with Antony; and, above all, that he had no good disposition towards the conspirators. He thought it impossible he should ever be a friend to them; and indeed he was persuaded, that if ever he obtained the ascendency, his uncle’s acts would be more violently enforced, and his death more cruelly revenged, than even by Antony himself. Accordingly, when Cicero at last consented to unite himself to Octavius’s interests, it was with no other view than to arm him with a power sufficient to control Antony, yet so checked and limited, that he should not be able to oppress the republic.\n",
      "In the midst of all this political bustle he still prosecuted his studies with his usual application; and, besides some philosophical pieces, now finished his book of Offices, or the Duties of Man, for the use of his son. However, he paid constant attention to public affairs, and missed no opportunities, but on the contrary did every thing that human prudence could suggest, for the restoration of the republic; indeed all the vigour with which the last effort was made in its behalf, was entirely owing to his counsels and authority. This appears from the memorable Philippics which from time to time he published against Antony, as well as from other monuments of antiquity. But all was in vain; for although Antony’s army was entirely defeated at the siege of Modena, and many people were in consequence led to imagine that the war was at an end, and the liberty of Rome established, yet the death of the consuls Pansa and Hirtius in that action gave a fatal blow to all Cicero s schemes, and proved the immediate cause of the ruin of the republic.\n",
      "Octavius having humbled the senate to his mind, marched towards Gaul to meet Antony and Lepidus, who had already passed the Alps, and brought their armies into Italy, in order to have a personal interview with him, which, in fact, had been privately concerted for settling the terms of a triple league, and dividing the power and provinces of Italy among themselves. The place appointed for this interview was a small island about two miles from Bononia, formed by the river Rhenus, which runs near that c∙ityt Here they met, and spent three days in close conference, adjusting the plan of their accommodation; and the last thing they settled was the list of a proscription of their common or individual enemies. This, as the writers tell us, occasioned much difficulty and warm contests among them, till each in his turn consented to sacrifice some of his best friends to the revenge and resentment of his colleagues. Cicero was at his Tusculan villa when he first received the news of the proscription, and of his being included in it at the instigation and to satisfy the vengeance of Antony. It was the design of the triumvirate to keep it a secret, if possible, till the very moment of execution, in order to surprise those whom they had destined to destruction, before they were aware of their danger, or had time to effect their escape. But some of Cicero’s friends found means to give him early notice of this infamous compact, upon which he set forward to the sea-coast, with the design of transporting himself beyond reach of his enemies. There, finding a vessel ready, he immediately embarked; but the winds being adverse, and the sea uneasy to him, after he had sailed about two leagues along the coast, he was obliged to land, and spend the night on shore. By the importunity of his servants, however, he was forced on board again; but he soon afterwards landed at a country-seat of his, a mile from the shore, weary of life, and declaring he was resolved to die in that country which he had so often saved. Here hc slept soundly for some time, till his servants once more forced him away in a litter towards the ship, having heard that he was pursued by Antony’s assassins. They had scarcely departed when the assassins arrived at his house, and, perceiving that he had fled, immediately pursued and overtook him in a wood near the shore. Their leader was one Popilius Lenas, a tribune of the army, whose life Cicero had formerly defended and saved. As soon as the soldiers appeared, the servants prepared to defend their master’s life at the hazard of their own; but Cicero commanded them to set him down and make no resistance. The assassins soon cut off his head and his hands, with which they returned to Rome as the most agreeable present to their savage and remorseless employer. Antony, who was then at Rome, received them with extreme joy, rewarded the murderers with a large sum of money, and ordered the head to be fixed upon the rostra between the two hands,—a sad spectacle to the city, and which drew tears from every eye.\n",
      "If wc take an impartial survey of Cicero’s conduct and principles, avowed in his own epistolary correspondence, and trace him through all the labyrinths of his contradictory letters, we shall perhaps find more to blame than to admire; and discover that the desire of advancing his fortunes, and making himself a namc, were, from his outset in life, the chief objects he had in view. The good of his country, and the dictates of a steady unyielding virtue, were not, as in Brutus and Cato, the constant springs of his actions. The misfortunes which befel him after his consulship developed his character, and showed him in his true colours: from that time to his death, pusillanimity, irresolution, and unworthy repining, tainted his judgment, and perplexed every step he attempted to take. He flattered Pompey and cringed to Caesar, while in his private letters he abused both alternately and impartially. He acknowledges, in a letter to his friend Atticus, that, although he was at present determined to support the cause of Rome and liberty, and to bear misfortune like a philosopher, there was one thing which would gain him over to the triumvirs, and that was their procuring for him the vacant augurship; so pitiful was the bribe to which he would have sacrificed his honour, his opinions, and the commonwealth.\n",
      "Cicero’s death happened on the 7th of December, in the sixty-fourth year of his age, about ten days after the settlement of the first triumvirate. As an orator he is thus characterized by a popular writer: “In all his orations his art is conspicuous. He begins commonly with a regular exordium, and with much address prepossesses the hearers, and studies to gain their affections. His method is clear, and his arguments are arranged with exact propriety. In a superior clearness of method, he has an advantage over Demosthenes. Every thing appears in its proper place. He never tries to move till he has attempted to convince; and in moving, particularly the softer passions, he is highly successful. No one ever knew the force of words better than Cicero. He rolls them along with the greatest beauty and magnificence; and in the structure of his sentences is eminently curious and exact. He is always full and flowing, never abrupt. He amplifies every thing; yet though his manner is generally diffuse, it is often happily varied and accommodated to the subject. When an important public object rou\n",

      "an extensive province of Hindustan, lying on the western side of the Bay of Bengal. It is a narrow slip of territory, extending from 15° 2' to the 20th degree of north lat., but is little more than one degree in breadth. The sea bounds it on the east along a coast 470 miles in length, from the port of Mootapilly to the town of Maloud in Orissa, on the borders of the Chilca Lake. From about fifty to seventy miles inland it is divided from the province of Hyderabad by a range of small detached hills, extending to the banks of the Godavery; and it is separated from Gundwana to the north of that river by a great ridge of mountains, impassable, where they have hitherto been explored, for horse or wheel-carriage, and which are continued to the northern, extremity of the Circars at Goomsur. From this last place the same unbroken chain curves to the eastward, and, together with the Chilca Lake, forms an almost impenetrable barrier, fifty miles in extent, to the north on the side of Cuttack, with the exception of a tongue of land between Lake Chilca and the sea. Towards the south the small river Gonde-zama, which empties itself at Mootapilly, separates this territory from the districts of Ongole, and forms the most definite modern frontier of the Carnatic below the Ghauts.\n",
      "The area of the Circars is 17,000 square miles, of which it is estimated that only one fifth is in cultivation or fallow, twice that portion in pasture, and the remainder is occupied by woods, water, towns, barren hills, or a sandy waste three miles in breadth, which borders the whole extent of the coast. The country for about thirty-five miles inland is a level plain, with only two remarkable interruptions in its greatest length along the shore. Beyond this about fifteen miles farther inland, and parallel to it, the country is much more elevated, being agreeably variegated with hills easy of access, and remarkably fertile. Beyond these tracts of plain and hilly ground, to the north of the Godavery, a still higher region extends close to the great ridge of mountains which stretch far inland. This region is poor, unhealthy, and thinly inhabited.\n",
      "The grand divisions of this province are properly five; being so many portions of its length, principally marked by rivers running across from the hills on the west to the sea. Of these divisions the first is Guntoor or Mortizabad, the most southerly province, bounded on the north by the river Kistnah, which, after running a curve of 600 miles from the Balaghaut Hills, near the coast of Malabar, separates this province on the north from the second division, namely, Condapilly or Mustaphabad. Ellore is the third division; and these two divisions are adjacent to each other, as well as to the Guntoor Circar, and occupy the whole space lying between the Kistnah and Godavery. The fourth division, namely, Rajcmundry, towards the south is separated from Ellore in its greatest breadth by the Godavcry. The fifth division is Cicacole, the most northerly of the whole.\n",
      "The climate of the Northern Circars, though it has a general resemblance to that of Hindustan north of the Kistnah, is still distinguished by local peculiarities arising from its maritime situation, and the extent and position of the inland hills. The periodical rain usually sets in about the middle of June with a westerly wind, and continues in moderate showers until the latter end of August, which is the period of the small grain harvest. The rain continues in greater abundance from this period until the beginning of November, when it generally ceases, and is succeeded by a strong north-easterly wind, tempered by the mild influence of the sea over which it blows. The harvest for rice and bajarry, which .are the great productions of the country north of the Godavery, finishes about the middle of this latter season, early in January; and in like manner the vernal equinox terminates the harvest south of that river for the different species of maize, as well as of other grains, and peas. Then commences the hot season, which is always moderate towards the northern extremity of the Circars, near Ganjam, owing to the constant breezes from the sea. On the south the hot season is moderated for two months by sea-breezes from the south blowing along the shore; but afterwards, until the period of the rains, the wind blowing over a parched loose soil of great extent, and especially over the almost dry and sandy bed of the Kistnah, becomes so heated that it raises the thermometer for an entire week to 105, and frequently to 110 degrees. In the hilly regions the air is in a remarkably noxious state; and throughout the different seasons of the year the hill fever, which is prevalent, is frequently fatal to strangers. It is generally ascribed to the state of the atmosphere, contaminated with the exhalations of a fertile soil, pent up in valleys, or impeded in its circulation by the luxuriant growth of plants, or by the trees with which the villages are surrounded. All these provinces along the coast have a sandy soil, which improves gradually towards the hills; and it seldom produces more than oen croþ annually, which, as there is an abundant supply of water, is extremely rich. The country is well watered by running streams, many of which are divided artificially into canals, and being conducted into tanks and reservoirs, are thus rendered subservient to cultivation. The province accordingly abounds in all the different sorts of grain which have been already mentioned; it is properly the granary of the Carnatic during the north-east monsoon. Fruits, roots, and greens are scarce, or reared with difficulty, to the south of the Godavery; nor towards the north are they so excellent as in some other provinces. Sugar and cotton are also scantily produced in Rajemundry and Jehapoor. Tobacco and bay salt, of superior quality, have lately been produced in such abundance as greatly to exceed the home demand. The forests of Rajemundry, from the commencement of the hills along the banks of the Godavery, yield an inexhaustible supply of the best and largest teak timbers; and if proper use were made of this advantage, an article would be procured of great advantage to commerce. The cocoa and the palmyra, or, in the more northerly provinces, the tree which produces thegum-arabic, are the materials from which are constructed about 500 of those unwieldy vessels with two masts, called doo-nies, from 60 to 300 tons each. The domestic animals found in this province are chiefly sheep and the larger species of horned cattle. The neighbouring sea and its numerous inlets abound with almost every species of Indian fish, together with some that are common to Europe, such as mullet, sole, and pomphlet, a small fish resembling a turbot.\n",
      "Cotton is the staple produce, from which are fabricated cloths of different degrees of fineness. Plain cloth, which is valuable in foreign markets, is chiefly wrought in the island of Nagar and its vicinity; it forms the groundwork of the best printed calicoes in Europe, and of those beautifully painted ones called palampores in the districts of Masulipatam. The coarser plain cloths, which are made to the north and south of the Godavery, or coloured with chay root, which is the madder of the East, and which grows in most perfection in the pure sands annually overflowed by the Krishna, are in great demand, both abroad and at home. Muslins are, besides, manufactured at Cicacole, beautiful woollen carpets at Ellore, and silks at Burrampore. But these are rather objects of curiosity than of any great general advantage; as is also the art of painting, or inlaying ivory and black wood in the cabinet work at Vizagapatam. Ship-building is carried on extensively in the ports of Coringa and Narsapore, the two principal mouths of the Godavery. Here ships of 500 tons are built, and about 50,000 tons of small craft are employed in the coasting trade.\n",
      "This province trades with Europe, with the neighbouring Indian ports, and with the inland provinces of the Deccan. The European nations who have establishments on the coast export the fine cotton manufactures, which are also purchased by foreign adventurers. In return for these manufactures, and for salt, which they export, treasure is frequently brought from Madras, the principal part of the Madras investment of piece-goods being provided in the Northern Circars. The coasting trade consists chiefly in the exportation of various sorts of grain to Madras, in return for which are received the coarser sorts of cloths; European and China goods for the use of officers and others employed in that quarter, namely, wines of various sorts, ale, brandy, glass-ware, stationery, tea, copper, steel, hardware, &c.; also various goods received from the East, such as betel-nut to a great amount, alum, cloves, benjamin, pepper, tin, dammer, borax, and a quantity of arrack. The articles carried to the interior bv the native traders are salt, piece-goods of native manufacture, copper, and raw silk, the latter chiefly from Bengal, in return for which are received cotton and wheat.\n",
      "The native inhabitants of the Northern Circars, with the exception of some thousand Mahommedans dispersed throughout the principal towns, and in the army, are wholly Hindus, and may, on a moderate computation, be estimated at two and a half millions. They are composed of the two nations of Telinga, and Oria, Woria, or Orissa, formerly divided from each other by the Godavery, but, since their union under the same government, a good deal mixed among themselves, as well as with some of the neighbouring tribes. They have each their peculiar dialect, apparently of the Sanscrit language, as well as their peculiar rites, customs, and national traits. The four great castes or divisions of the people are common in both countries, but with less deviations from original institutions in Oria, where Brahminical abstinence from animal food is very general among all the higher tribes.

      "denotes nearly the same thingwith mercy, and implies a remission of severity towards offenders. The term is most generally used in speaking of the forgiveness exercised by princes or persons of high authority. It is the result, indeed, of a disposition which ought to be cultivated by all ranks, though its effects cannot bc equally conspicuous or extensive. In praise of clemency joined with power, it is observed, that it is not only the privilege, the honour, and the duty of a prince, but it is also his se-< curity, and better than all his garrisons, forts, and guards, to preserve himself and his dominions in safety; that that prince is truly royal who masters himself, looks upon all injuries as below him, and governs by equity and reason, not by passion or caprice. In illustration of this subject, the following examples arc selected out of many recorded in history.\n",
      "Two patricians having conspired against Titus the Roman emperor, were discovered, convicted, and sentenced to death by the senate; but the good-natured prince sent for them, and in private admonished them, that they aspired in vain to the empire, which was given by destiny; exhorting them to be satisfied with the rank in which providence had placed them, and offering them any thing else which might be in his power to grant. At the same time he dispatched a messenger to the mother of one of them, who was then at a great distance, and under deep concern about tb.e fate of her son, to assure her that her son was not only alive, but forgiven.\n",
      "Licinius having raised a numerous army, Zosimus says 130,000 men, endeavoured to wrcst the government out of the hands of his brother-in-law Constantine the emperor. But his army being defeated, Licinius fled with what forces he could rally to Nicomcdia, whither Constantine pursued him, and immediately invested the place; but on the second day of the siege, the emperor’s sister having entreated him, with a flood of tears, by the tenderness he had ever shown for hcr, to forgive hcr husband, and grant him at least his life,*hc was prevailed upon to comply with her request; and the next day, Licinius, finding no means of making his escape, presented himself before the conqueror, and throwing himself at his feet, yielded to him the purple and the other ensigns of sovereignty. Constantine received him in a very friendly manner, entertained him at his table, and afterwards sent him to Thessalonica, assuring him that he should live unmolested so long as he raised no ncw disturbances.\n",
      "The council of thirty, established at Athens by Lysander, committed the most execrable cruelties. Upon pretence of restraining the multitude within thcir duty, and to prevent seditions, they caused guards to be assigned them, armed 3000 of the citizens for that purpose, and at the same time disarmed all the rest. The whole city was thrown into the utmost terror and dismay. λVhoever opposed their injustice and violence fell a victim to their resentment. Riches were a crime which never failed to draw a sentence upon their owners, always followed with death and the confiscation of estates, which the thirty tyrants divided amongst themselves. They put more people to death, says Xenophon, in eight months of a peace, than their enemies had donc in a war of thirty years. All the citizens of any consideration in Athens, who retained a love of liberty, quitted a place reduced to so merciless and shameful a state of slavery, and sought elsewhere an asylum, where they might live in safety. At the head of these was Thrasybulus, a person of extraordinary merit, who beheld with the most lively affliction the miseries of 11 is country.\n",
      "But the Lacedaemonians had the inhumanity to endeavour to deprive those unhappy fugitives of this last resource. They published an edict prohibiting the cities of Greece from giving them refuge; decreed that they should be delivered up to the thirty tyrants; and condemned all such as should contravene the execution of this edict to pay a fine of five talents. Only two cities rejected with disdain so unjust an ordinance, Megara and Thebes; the latter of which passed a decree to punish all persons whatsoever that should see an Athenian attacked by his enemies without doing their utmost to assist him. Lysias, an orator  of Syracuse, who had been banished by the thirty, raised 500 soldiers at his own expense, and sent them to the aid of the common country of eloquence. Thrasybulus lost no time in making the necessary preparations. After having taken Phyla, a small fort in Attica, he marched to the Piraeus, of which he made himself master. The thirty flew thither with their troops, and a battle ensued; but the tyrants were completely overthrown. Critias, the most savage of their number, was killed on the spot; and as the army was taking to flight, Thrasybulus cried out, “Wherefore do you fly from me as from a victor, rather than assist me as the avenger of your liberty? We are not enemies, but fellow-citizens; nor have we declared war against the city, but against the thirty tyrants.” He continued to remind them that they had the same origin, country, laws, and religion. He exhorted them to compassionate their exiled brethren, to restore their country to the latter, and resume their own liberty. This discourse had the desired effect. The army, upon their return to Athens, expelled the thirty, and substituted ten persons to govern in their room, whose conduct proved no better than theirs; but King Pausanias, moved with compassion for the deplorable condition to which a city, once so flourishing, was reduced, had the generosity to favour the Athenians in secret, and at length obtained a peace for them. It was sealed with the blood of the tyrants, who having taken arms to reinstate themselves in the government, were all put to the sword; and this left Athens in the full possession of its liberty. All the exiles were recalled. Thrasybulus at that time proposed the celebrated amnesty, by which the citizens engaged upon oath that all past transactions should be buried in oblivion. The government was re-established upon its ancient footing, the laws were restored to their pristine vigour, and magistrates were elected with the usual forms.\n",
      "This, says Rollin, is one of the finest events in ancient history, worthy the Athenian clemency and benevolence, and has served as a model to succeeding ages in all good governments. Never had tyranny been more cruel and bloody than that which the Athenians had lately thrown off. Every house was in mourning, every family bewailed the loss of some relation; it had been a series of public robbery and rapine, in which license and impunity had authorized all manner of crimes. The people seemed to have a right to demand the blood of all accomplices in such notorious malversations, and even the interest of the state appeared to authorize such a claim, that by exemplary severities such enormous crimes might be prevented for the future. But Thrasybulus rising above these sentiments, from the superiority of his more extensive genius, and the views of a more discerning and profound policy, foresaw, that by acquiescing in the punishment of the guilty, eternal seeds of discord and enmity would remain, to weaken the public by domestic divisions, when it was necessary to unite against the common enemy, and would also occasion the loss to the state of a great number of citizens, who might render it important services in. the view of making amends for past misbehaviour.\n",
      "Such conduct, after great troubles in a state, has always appeared to the ablest politicians the most certain and ready means to restore the public peace and tranquillity. Cicero, when Rome was divided into two factions upon the occasion of Caesar’s death, who had been killed by the conspirators, calling to mind this celebrated amnesty, proposed, after the example of the Athenians, to bury all that had passed in eternal oblivion.\n",
      "Cardinal Mazarin observed to Don Lewis de Haro, prime minister of Spain, that his gentle and humane conduct in France had prevented the troubles and revolts cŧ that kingdom from having any fatal consequences, and “that the king had not lost a foot of land by them to that day ;” whereas “the inflexible severity of the Spaniards was the occasion that the subjects of that monarchy, wherever they threw off the mask, never returned to their obedience but by the force of arms; which sufficiently appears,” says he, “in the example of the Hollanders, who are in the peaceable possession of so many provinces that not an age ago were the patrimony of the king of Spain.”\n",
      "Leonidas the Lacedaemonian having, with 300 men only, disputed .the Pass of Thermopylae against the whole army of Xerxes, and being killed in that engagement, Xerxes, by the advice of Mardonius, one of his generals, caused his dead body to be hung upon a gallows, thereby making the intended dishonour of his enemy his own immortal shame. But some time afterwards, Xerxes being defeated, and Mardonius slain, one of the principal citizens of AEgina came and addressed himself to Pausanius, desiring him to avenge the indignity which Mardonius and Xerxes had shown to Leonidas, by treating Mardonius’s body after the same manner; and as a farther motive for doing so, he added, that by thus satisfying the manes of those who were killed at Thermopylae, he would be sure to immortalize his own name throughout all Greece, and render his memory precious to the latest posterity. “Carry thy base counsels elsewhere,” replied Pausanias; “thou must have a very wrong notion of true glory, to imagine that the way for me to acquire it is to resemble the barbarians. If the esteem of the people of AEgina is not to be purchased but by such a proceeding, I shall be content with preserving that of the Lacedaemonians only, amongst whom the base and ungenerous pleasure of revenge is never put in competition with that of showing clemency and moderation to their enemies, especially after their death.

      "from his earliest years, discovered the strongest propensity towards literary pursuits, which determined his father to qualify him for the ministry; but he was thwarted in his designs by a numerous and increasing family, and therefore Benjamin was taken from the more learned seminary, and placed under a teacher of reading and writing, preparatory to his being bound to some handicraft trade. At ten years of age he was withdrawn from school to take part in the drudgery of his father’s trade. This greatly mortified the aspiring mind of young Franklin, who would have preferred a seafaring life to such an employment; but from this he was dissuaded by the influence of his father, who was a man of considerable penetration and judgment. He made it his chief aim to inspire his children with the love of knowledge and the principles of moral rectitude. He had few books; yet from amongst these Benjamin selected a number of voyages and travels, as well as different histories, a species of reading for which he had a strong predilection. By going through a course of controversial divinity in this unaided manner, he greatly strengthened his argumentative powers, which was most probably all he had in view. Defoe upon Projects, according to his own account, made impressions upon his mind which in a great measure influenced the principal events of his subsequent career.\n",
      "He was now chosen to an employment which accorded much better with the natural bent of his mind than the business of a tallow-chandler. A brother of his own had a printing office in Boston, and to him Benjamin was bound apprentice at twelve years of age. With the mechanical part of the business he was soon acquainted; and the opportunities thus afforded him of procuring new books to read were eagerly seized, and the greater part of the night frequently spent in the perusal of them. He soon became anxious to imitate the works which he most admired, and his first attempts were of a poetical nature. He composed and printed ballads, which were well received by those who love this species of reading; yet his father had the address to convince him that nature never designed him for a poet. He accordingly turned his whole attention to the cultivation of prose composition, in which he made great progress. He had a young friend with whom he kept up an epistolary dispute, which afforded him an admirable opportunity of exercising his pen. He also read with avidity and attention various works, particularly Xenophon’s Memorabilia, which enabled him either to confute or confound an adversary by a number of questions. It is also certain that he became a sceptic as to the religion in which he had been educated, and propagated his unbelief with zeal and assiduity. The fatal consequences which this produced on the deportment of some of his intimate companions at length happily convinced him that it is extremely dangerous to destroy the salutary influence of religion, without being able to substitute anything in its place of equal importance and efficacy. He seems, however, to have continued a sceptic in his own mind; yet he still retained a love for moral rectitude, which led him to adopt honourable means in the prosecution of valuable ends. Much to his honour be it spoken, he acquired, at a very early period of life, that triumph over his sensual appetites, which is so essentially necessary to a life of dignity, usefulness, and virtue. Having read Tyron’s recommendation of a vegetable diet, at sixteen years of age, he abandoned the use of animal food; and on offering to his brother to support himself on half the money which was paid for his board, he was allowed to adopt his own plan, by which means he was enabled to save a considerable sum for the purc)ιase of books. Although he relaxed considerably as to a vegetable diet, yet he thus acquired the habit of being satisfied with little; and a contempt of the gratifications of the palate was frequently of singular advantage to him throughout the whole of his life.\n",
      "His brother having commenced a newspaper, Benjamin sent a number of pieces on various topics to be inserted, which met with the approbation of the most competent judges; a satisfaction he enjoyed without being known, as they were all anonymous. His brother treated him with the harshness of a master, which he bore with the utmost impatience, as the public had already pronounced him to be possessed of merit. The states of America having prohibited James Franklin from publishing this paper, on account of some political offence, the name of Benjamin was employed as publisher, in consequence of which he procured his indentures, although he agreed privately wiüi his brother to serve out his time. But having been harshly treated by his brother, he went to New York by sea, and from that place to Philadelphia, in the seventeenth year of his age. He himself acknowledges this to hav'e been a fault, and has therefore averted that censure which he would otherwise have deserved. At Philadelphia he engaged with a printer of the name of Keimer, whose affairs he soon placed on a more respectable footing; and here also he became acquainted with several young men of a literary turn of mind, by whose company his taste was greatly improved.\n",
      "Shortly after his arrival he became acquainted with Sir William Keith, at that period governor of the province, who was struck with the composition and penmanship of young Franklin, and strenuously advised him to commence business on his own account, promising to use his influence in his favour. Encouraged by this gentleman to adopt such a plan, he set out for Boston on a visit to his parents, in order to procure from them some pecuniary aid; but a welcome reception was all he could obtain. Having returned to Philadelphia without accomplishing his object, Sir William offered to take the whole burden upon himself, and advised Franklin to make a voyage to England in order to procure every thing necessary for establishing a printing-office. He accordingly set sail in the year 1725, and took with him his intimate companion Ralph, who has been celebrated in the Dunciad. Unfortunately for Franklin, Sir William Keith, on whose letters of recommendation and credit he entirely relied, deceived him, and he was compelled to work as a journeyman in London for his immediate subsistence. His friend Ralph could only live by his head, and his income of consequence was extremely circumscribed, as well as precarious, which made him a heavy burden upon Franklin. In the dissolute metropolis the one forgot his wife and child in America, and the other the solemn promises of fidelity which he had made to a Miss Read prior to his departure, another step of his conduct which he himself severely censures. By a dissertation on liberty and necessity, pleasure and pain, he acquired considerable reputation; and it was the means of introducing him to the celebrated Dr Mandeville, author of the Fable of the Boes. In the second printing-office in which he worked, he laboured incessantly to convince his fellow-workmen that a pint of porter does not contain half so much nourishment as a penny roll, for which he obtained the ludicrous epithet of the American aquatic; yet he was finally enabled to make many converts to his doctrine; a proof that he possessed strong persuasive powers, when we consider the deep-rooted attachment of those with whom he had to treat to their favourite beverage.\n",
      "After eighteen months residence in London, he returned to Philadelphia in the year 1726, and became clerk to a Mr Denham, a man of respectability, who had opened a warehouse in that city. He soon became acquainted with the principles of commerce, and led a very happy life in this new situation, till the connection was dissolved by the death of Mr Denham, which happened the following year. This again obliged him to become journeyman printer, and he was afterwards overseer in the office of Keimer his former master.\n",
      "Keimer having engaged Franklin solely with the view of having his apprentices so far initiated in the art that he could dispense with their instructor’s services, took the first occasion to quarrel with him when he thought he had sufficiently attained his object. Upon their separation, one of Keimer , s apprentices, named Meredith, who, like all the others, had conceived a great veneration for Franklin, proposed that they should enter into partnership together, Meredith’s friends undertaking to furnish the capital necessary for purchasing the materials, &c. This offer was too advantageous to be refused; and types, a press, and other things, were forthwith commissioned from London; but whilst preparing to puttheir plan into execution, Franklin was induced, during the interval, to return again to Keimer, at the urgent solicitation of the latter. The motive for this humble entreaty was that individual’s having taken a contract for the printing of some paper-money for the state of New Jersey, requiring a variety of new cuts and types, which he knew well nobody in that place but Franklin could supply. This also presents us with a very striking instance of Franklin’s remarkable gift of invention. “To execute the order,” says he, “I constructed a copperplate printing-press, the first that had been seen in the country. I engraved various ornaments and vignettes for the bills, and we repaired to Burlington together, where I executed the whole to the general satisfaction, and he (Keimer) received a sum of money for this work which enabled him to keep his head above water for a considerable time longer.”\n",
      "At Burlington, Franklin formed acquaintance with all the principal personages of the province, who were attracted by his superior abilities and intelligence. Amongst these was the inspector-general, Isaac Decon, “who,” says Franklin, “was a shrewd and subtile old man. He told me that his first employment had been that of carrying clay to the brick-makers; that he did not learn to write till he was somewhat a\n",

      "a profound mathematician and astronomer, was born at Milan the 13th April 1728; his family had formerly emigrated from Strasburg, and was established at Milan in an humble station of life.\n",
      "At the age of fifteen he entered into the convent of the Barnabite friars, or of the congregation of St Paul, where his studies were at first confined to the attainment ot some knowledge of geography from the contemplation ot the old maps that were pasted on the walls of the galleries; he soon acquired, however, a taste for geometry, and made considerable progress in it without an instructor. He was sent to the university of Pavia to go through a course of divinity, and he did not neglect the opportunity of applying with increased diligence to the mathematics, with the assistance of Professor Olivetano, He was afterwards removed to Lodi, in order to give lectures there on philosophy; and he soon after distinguished himself by writing a most able essay on the Figure oj the Earth, which, however, he had not the means of printing, as his brethren were unwilling to assist him, until ht found a patron for his publication in the Count de Silva, ' who undertook to be at the expense of the impression.\n",
      "The credit which he acquired induced some other members of the society to follow his example, and the convent of the Bamabitcs at Milan soon began to be converted into a nursery of mathematics. His reputation procured him also, from the king of Sardinia, the appointment of professor of philosophy in the college of Casale. Here, however, he thought the conduct of his superiors unjust and tyrannical, and they were also dissatisfied with him on account of his great intimacy with Radicati, whose opinions were rather more liberal than they thought it prudent to tolerate. This friendship was, however, so far of advantage to Frisi, as it tended to improve his taste in modern literature; but it was the principal cause of his being removed to Novara, where he was obliged to undertake the duties of a preacher. In the mean time he was nominated a correspondent of the Parisian Academy of Sciences in 1753, and received similar honours from other scientific bodies. Soon after this he was recalled to Milan, and made professor of philosophy in the great Barnabite College of St Alexander in that city. His dissertation on the Figure of the Earth was very acrimoniously attacked by a young Jesuit, who accused him of being improperly led away by English and French innovations; but it was easy for him to repel so unfounded a charge. From this time he entertained much ill humour against the Jesuits in general, and had written a work to depreciate the order, but he was advised by his second brother to suppress it. He became, however, more and more connected with the enemies of the Jesuits, and, among them, with D’Alembert, Condorcet, and the other Encyclopédistes. He had before this time declared himself, in his lectures, an enemy to the popular opinions of the Italians respecting magic and witchcraft, though he felt himself in some danger of the animadversions of the Inquisition. He was much in the habit of frequenting the best societies in Milan, and even more than was thought consistent with his religious character; but he was in some measure emancipated from the restraints of his order, by his appointment, in 1756, to a professorship in the university of Pisa, for which he was indebted to the Grand Duke Leopold. This situation he retained for eight years, enjoying the highest degree of credit, and receiving marked attention from all travellers of distinction, and saving, at the same time, a considerable portion of his salary, to which he added the amount of some prizes which he obtained from Berlin and Petersburg in 1756, and from Paris in 1758. Notwithstanding his occupations as a professor of moral philosophy, he had always been in the habit of devoting the greater part of his attention to the mathematical sciences. In 1757 he was made an associate of the Imperial Academy of Peterβhurg, and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London; in 1758, a member of the Academy of Berlin; in 1766, of that of Stockholm; and in 1770, of the Academies of Copenhagen and of Berne. The Archduke Joseph had sent him, in 1759, a collar with a gold medal, and he received similar marks of distinction from the kings of Prussia and Denmark. He was also liberally rewarded by Pope Clement XIII. for his services in arranging a dispute between the people of Ferrara and of Bologna on the subject of rivers and torrents, which had been referred to him on the occasion of a tour that he made to Naples and to Rome in 1760. The senate of Venice also made him a proper acknowledgment for the assistance he gave to the commissioners whom they had appointed to control the ravages of the Brenta. The Empress Maria Theresa settled on him a pension of 100 sequins, or L.50 a year. He was recalled to Milan in 1764, as professor of mathematics in the Palatine schools, with appointments equal to those which he had enjoyed at Pisa, and with the additional advantage of living near his family, and being enabled to promote their interests. He was at various times much engaged in the decision of controversies respecting canals and rivers, and obtained much credit for his skill and ingenuity; though the peculiarities of his temper tended somewhat to increase the number of enemies, which might possibly have been unavoidable. Among other controversies, he was engaged in a dispute respecting the propriety of adding a high pinnacle to the dome of the church at Milan, which has since been raised in opposition to his opinion. In 1766 he undertook a journey into France and England, and his celebrity everywhere procured him the most flattering attentions. At Paris a very liberal proposal was made to him to remove to Lisbon, but he preferred returning to his own country. In 1768 he went to Vienna, and he was consulted by the government there upon some imnortant questions of ecclesiastical policy, in which his advice was adopted. He remained but little longer in the college of St Alexander, and Pope Pius VI. liberated him entirely from subjection to the superiors of his order, and allowed him to wear the habit of a secular priest. As one of the censors of the press, he had incautiously been accessory to the publication of the Lanterna Curiosa, the work of a coffee-house club in Milan, which gave great offence to the government; and he afterwards still more imprudently undertook to defend it. This circumstance occasioned his removal from Milan for a time, but he was recalled in 1777, and was appointed director of a school of architecture. He was active in introducing the employment of conductors for security against lightning, and had one fixed for an example on the repository of the public archives. He was equally zealous on every other occasion, in the dissemination of useful novelties among his countrymen. In 1778 he made a tour into Switzerland, and his observations there gave rise to his speculations on subterraneous rivers. He enjoyed uninterrupted health until the age of forty-eight, when he was attacked by a haemorrhoidal affection, ending in an abscess, which, eight years afterwards, required the performance of an operation; this was unfortunately succeeded by a fatal mortification, and he died the 22d November 1784, at the moment when he was about to be placed on the list of the eight foreign associates of the Parisian Academy; an honour which had been delayed by the preference of J. A. Euler, on the occasion of a former vacancy, to the no small mortification of his vanity. He had very lately obtained a prize from the Academy of Haerlem, for his memoir on the Inequality of the Satellites of Jupiter. He was buried in the church of St Alexander, and a medallion with his portrait was placed over his tomb by his brethren Barnabites. He had four brothers, Antony, a physician, botanist, and chemist; Antony Francis, an ecclesiastic, author of some antiquarian researches of merit; Louis, a canon of St Ambrose, a learned theologian and mechanician; and Philip, a lawyer, author of a dissertation, De Imperio et Jurisdictione.\n",

      "ceremonies accompanying the interment or burial of the dead. The word is formed of the Latin funus, and that of funalia, on account of the torches (Junes cera circumdati) used in the funerals of the Romans. Others, however, derive funus from the Greek φonς, death or slaughter.\n",
      "The first people who seem to have paid any particular respect to their dead were the Egyptians, the posterity of Ham, the first cultivators of idolatrous worship and superstition after the deluge. They were also the first who asserted the immortality of the sou', its migration into all kinds of animals, and its return to the human body, which they supposed to be within the term of three thousand years. Hence the great care which they evinced in embalming their dead, and the vast expense they incurred in building proper repositories for them. In fact, they were more solicitous about graves for the dead than about houses for the living. This is strikingly displayed in those stupendous remains of architecture under ground which were appropriated to the reception of the dead, as well as those above ground, such as the pyramids, where some of the Egyptian kings were interred.\n",
      "Amongst the Egyptians, when a person died, his parents and friends put on mourning habits, and abstained from all banquets and entertainments. This mourning lasted from forty to seventy days, during which period they embalmed the body. After this ceremony was completed, it was restored to the friends, who placed it in a kind of open chest, which was preserved either in their houses, or in the sepulchres of their ancestors. But before the dead were allowed to be deposited in the tomb, they underwent a solemn judgment, which extended even to their kings. Of this remarkable custom we have a particular account in the first book of Diodorus Siculus. “Those who prepare to bury a relative give notice of the day intended for the ceremony to the judges, and to all the friends of the deceased, informing them that the body will pass over the lake of that district to which the dead belonged; when, on the judges assembling, to the number of more than forty, and ranging themselves in a semicircle on the further side of the lake, the vessel is set afloat, which those who superintend the funeral have prepared for this purpose. This vessel is managed by a pilot, called in the Egyptian language Charon; and hence they say, that Orpheus, travelling in o>d times into Egypt, and seeing this ceremony, formed his fable of the infernal regions, partly from what he saw, ana partly from invention. The vessel being launched on the lake, before the coffin which contains the body is put on board, the law permits all who are so inclined to produce an accusation against it. If any one steps forth and proves that the deceased has led an evil life, the judges pronounce sentence, and the body is precluded from burial; but if the accuser is convicted of injustice in his charge he falls himself under a considerable penalty. When no accuser appears, or when the accusation is proved to be an unfair one, the relations who are assembled change their expressions of sorrow into encomiums on the dead; yet do not, like the Greeks, speak in honour of his family, because they consider all Egyptians as equally well born; but they set forth the education and manners of his youth, his piety and justice in maturer life, his moderation, and every virtue by which he was distinguished; and they supplicate the infernal deities to receive him as an associate amongst the blessed. The multitude join their acclamations of applause in this celebration of the dead, whom they consider as going to pass an eternity amongst the just below.” Such is the description which Diodorus gives of this funeral judicature, to which even the kings of Egypt were subject. The same author asserts that many sovereigns had been thus judicially deprived of the honours of burial by the indignation of their people; and that the terrors of such a fate had the most salutary influence on the conduct of their kings.\n",
      "The funeral rites amongst the Hebrews were solemn and magnificent. Upon the demise of any person, the relatives and friends of the deceased rent their clothes. This custom is still imitated, but with a due regard to economy, by the modern Jews, who only cut off a piece of their garment in token of affliction. It was usual to bend the dead person’s thumb into the hand, and fasten it in that posture with a string, because the thumb having then the figure of the name of God, they thought the evil spirit would not dare to approach it. When they came to the burying-place, they made a speech to the dead in the following terms: “Blessed be God, who has formed thee, fed thee, maintained thee, and taken away thy life. O dead, he knows your numbers, and shall one day restore your life and so on. After this they delivered the eulogium, or funeral oration, upon the deceased; then said a prayer, called the “righteousness of judgment and finally, turning the face of tire dead body towards heaven, they called out, “Go in peace.”\n",
      "Amongst the ancient Greeks it was usual sometimes, before the interment, to place a piece of money in the mouth of the deceased, as Charon’s fare for wafting the departed soul over the river Styx. This ceremony was considered as unnecessary in those countries which were supposed to be situated in the neighbourhood of the infernal regions, and to lead thither by a ready and direct road. The corpse was likewise furnished with a cake, composed of flour, honey, and other ingredients, which was designed to appease the fury of Cerberus, and to procure the ghost a safe and quiet entrance. Whilst the corpse continued in the house, a vessel of water was placed before the door, the design of which was, that those concerned about the body might purify themselves by washing; it being the opinion of the Greeks, as well as of the Jews, that pollution was contracted by touching a dead body.\n",
      "The ceremonies by which they expressed their sorrow for the death of their friends were various; but it seems to have been a constant rule to recede as much as possible in ' habit and behaviour from their ordinary customs. For this reason they abstained from banquets and entertainments; they divested themselves of all ornaments; and they tore, cut off, or shaved their hair, which they cast into the funeral pile, to be consumed with the remains of their deceased friend. Sometimes they threw themselves on the ground and rolled in the dust, or covered their heads witlι ashes. They beat their breasts, and even tore their flesh with their nails, upon the loss of a person whom they much lamented. When people of rank, such as public magistrates or great generals, died, the whole city mourned their loss. All public meetings were intermitted; the schools, baths, shops, temples, and all places of concourse were shut up.\n",
      "After interment followed the epulιe or feasts, at which the company used to appear crowned; and upon this occasion they spoke in praise of the dead, as far as they could go with truth, it being esteemed a notorious wickedness to disregard truth in their eulogiums. And not only at these feasts, but even before the company quitted the sepulchre, they were sometimes entertained with a panegyric upon the deceased.\n",
      "The Grecian soldiers who died in battle had not only their tombs adorned with inscriptions showing their names, parentage, and exploits, but were also honoured with an oration in their praise. The custom amongst the Athenians in the interment of their soldiers was as follows: “They used to place the bodies of their dead in tents three days before the funeral, that all persons might have an opportunity of finding out their relatives, and paying their last respects to them. Upon the fourth day a coffin of cypress was sent from every tribe to convey the bones of their own relatives; after which went a covered hearse, in memory of those whose bodies could not be found. All these, accompanied by a concourse of people, were carried to the public burying-place, called Ceramicus, and there interred. One oration was spoken in commendation of them all, and their monuments were adorned with pillars, inscriptions, and other ornaments usual about the tombs of the most honourable persons. The oration was pronounced by the fathers of the deceased persons who had behaved themselves most valiantly. Thus, after the battle of Marathon, the fathers of Callimachus and Cynaegyrus were appointed to pronounce the funeral oration. And on the return of the day upon which the solemnity was first held, the same oration was annually repeated.”\n",
      "Interring or laying the dead in the ground seems to have been the most ancient practice amongst the Greeks; though burning came afterwards to be generally had recourse to. It was customary to throw into the funeral pile those garments which the deceased had usually worn. The pile was lighted by one of his nearest relatives or friends, who made prayers and vows to the wind to assist the flames, that the body might quickly be reduced to ashes; and whilst the pile was burning, the friends of the deceased stood by it, called upon him, and poured out libations of wine.\n",
      "The funeral rites amongst the ancient Romans were very numerous. The deceased was kept seven days, and every day washed with hot water, and sometimes with oil, that, in case he was only in a slumber, he might be thus awakened; and at intervals his friends collected and raised a shout with the same intent. This last act they called conclamatio. The third conclamation was on the seventh day; when, if no signs of life appeared, the defunct was dressed and embalmed by the pollinctores, placed in a bed near the door, with his face and heels towards the street; and the outside of the gate, if the deceased were of condition, was hung with cypress boughs. In the course of these seven days an altar was raised near his bed side, called acerra, on which his friends every day offered incense; \n",

      "an eminent Italian writer, was born at Chieti, in the Neapolitan province of Abruzzo, on the 2d of December 1728. At eight years of age he was sent to his uncle at Naples, who was then first chaplain to the king. Here he received his elementary education, along with his brother Bernard, who was a few years older. In 1740, the uncle being obliged to go to Rome upon a political mission, he gave his two nephews in charge to the Celestine fathers, for the continuance of their studies; and accordingly, in the course of two years, they were instructed in philosophy, the mathematics, and other liberal sciences. The archbishop, on his return to Naples, received them back into his palace, where they studied law, and enjoyed the society and conversation of the most distinguished professors of the university of Naples. Ferdinand, who possessed great talents and vivacity, devoted himself with ardour to the study of history, antiquities, the belles lettres, and philosophy, and more particularly to political economy. At the age of sixteen he produced a Memoir on the Coins of the period of the Trojan War ; and this early production first inspired him with the idea of his great work on money. He also translated Locke's treatise on Money and Interest. At the age of eighteen he undertook a work on the Ancient History of the Navigation of the Mediterranean ; and in his great work, we find that he there made use of part of the materials which he had collected at this early age. A Jeu d'esprit, which had nearly been attended with serious consequences, diverted him for some time from his graver studies. Having been charged by his brother Bernard to deliver, in his absence, a discourse in an academy of which he was a member, the president, looking only at the youth of Ferdinand, and being ignorant of his talents, would not permit him to proceed. The latter resolved to revenge himself in a manner that showed more spirit than prudence. It was the custom in this academy, as in several others, that when any great personage died at Naples, all the academicians published, in his praise, a collection of pieces in prose and verse. The executioner at Naples having died, Galiani seized the opportunity of turning the academy into ridicule. With the assistance of a friend, he composed, in the course of a few days, a collection of serious pieces on this event, which were ascribed to each of the members, and in which their peculiar style and manner were so well imitated, that one of them confessed he should have been himself deceived, if he had not been perfectly certain that he had not written the piece to which his name was subscribed. This malicious and witty little volume appeared in 1749, under the title of Componimenti varj per la Morte di Domenico Jannacone, Camefice della gran corte della vicaria, raecolti e dati in luce da Gian. Anton. Sergio Awocato Napoletano. This Sergio was the president of the academy. The publication was eminently successful, and excited a sensation which the authors had not foreseen; and as they became afraid of being discovered by the publisher, tl>ey went directly to the minister Tanucci, confessed the fact, and got off for the performance of some spiritual exercises.\n",
      "Galiani soon effaced the impression made by this piece of youthful folly, by the publication of his Treatise on Money, which had employed the labour of several years. It appeared at Naples in 1750, when the author was only twenty-one. It was first published anonymously, and the author did not make himself known until the success of the work was decided. The Archbishop of Tarentum took this occasion to patronize him, and procured for him several benefices, which induced him to take orders. He afterwards travelled through the whole of Italy, was presented at the various courts, and found himself every where preceded by his reputation. He was well received by the pope and several of the Italian princes; he was admitted a member of some of the most celebrated academies; and he established a correspondence with many of the most eminent literary characters. His next publication was a treatise entitled Della perfetta Conservations del Grano, written, with his usual elegance, for the purpose of recommending an ingenious machine, invented by his friend Intieri, for drying and preserving grain.\n",
      "The active mind of Galiani was now engaged in investigating several scientific subjects, particularly connected with antiquities and natural history. He was the first who undertook to form a collection of the volcanic productions of Vesuvius; and he wrote a learned treatise upon this subject, which, however, was not printed until about fifteen years afterwards. He presented the manuscript to Pope Benedict XIV. along with the collection itself, which was arranged in seven boxes, according to the order of the treatise. The collection was placed in the Museum of the Institute of Bologna, where it still remains. In presenting this collection to the pope, Galiani had written upon one of the boxes, Beatissime Pater, fac ut lapides isti panes fiant. His holiness, understanding the hint, gave him the prebend of Amalfi, worth 400 ducats a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the lifetime of his uncle, whom he lost in 1753, he enjoyed a benefice of 500 ducats, which conferred upon him the episcopal dignity, and another living worth 600 ducats. His funeral oration, on the death of his patron, Benedict XIV., who died in 1758, procured him a high character for eloquence, and was one of his works which he himself most esteemed.\n",
      "Galiani was one of the members of the academy of Herculaneum, established by King Charles III. for the purpose of illustrating the remains of ancient art discovered among the ruins of that city; and he furnished several memoirs, which were inserted in the first volume of that magnificent work, the Antiquities of Herculaneum. With the other academicians who were engaged in this labour, Galiani enjoyed the royal bounty, in a pension of 250 ducats.\n",
      "In the month of January 1759 he was appointed secretary of state and of the royal household, and, soon afterwards, secretary to the French embassy; and he arrived at Paris in the month of June following. Here his reception was exceedingly flattering, and his company was courted in all polite literary societies. The ambassador was the Count Cantillano, marquis of Castromonte, a Spanish nobleman, of much indolence and little talent. During the absence of the count on a six months’ journey to Spain, Galiani remained charge ďaffaires, was presented to the king of France, and enjoyed all the advantages of his situation. He applied himself with great zeal and assiduity to the acquisition of a correct French style of writing; and about this time he commenced his learned and ingenious Commentary on Horace, of which the Abbé Arnaud inserted some extracts in the fifth, sixth, and seventh volumes of his Gazette Littéraire for 1765. About the commencement of that year Galiani had set out for Naples, for the purpose of taking the waters of Ischia. Long after his period of leave had expired, he was retained by the government, employed and consulted in several matters of importance, and at length appointed a member of the Supreme Council of Commerce. With this new title he returned to Paris; and about a year afterwards he obtained permission to travel for a few months in England, having been invited to that country by the Marquis of Caracciolo, who was then ambassador from the court of Naples at London. He returned through Holland to Paris, and soon afterwards wrote in French his celebrated Dialogues sur le Commerce des Blés; the style of which is so easy and elegant, that one would never suppose it to be the work of a foreigner. The manuscript was left in the hands of Diderot, and was published in 1770, with the date of London, and without the name of the author. The work excited great attention in France, and the best writers were loud and unanimous in their praise of it. Vohaire wrote to Diderot, who had sent him a copy, in the following terms: “The powers of Plato and Molière seem to be combined in the composition of this work. I have as yet only read about two thirds of it; and I expect the denouement of the piece with great impatience.” 1 he same author again praises the work in his Questions sur ĪBncyclopedie, m the article Bled ou Blé.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Galiani had returned to Naples, where, in addition to his office of member of the Council of Commerce, he received that of secretary to the same tribunal. These two situations brought him a revenue of 1600 ducats. In 1777 he was made one of the ministers of the junto of the royal domains, who had the charge of every thing connected with the private patrimony of the king; an office which added 200 ducats to his income.

There is a life of Horace prefixed, much better and more complete than that which is inserted in the works of Algarotti. , The project which he entertained of a dramatic academy induced him to attempt the composition of a comic opera, in a new and singular style. This was The Imaginary Socrates, of which he gave the plan to the poet Lorenzi, who put it into verse, and it was set to music by the celebrated Paesiello. The piece was performed with the greatest success throughout Italy, Germany, and even at St Petersburg. Galiani himself was passionately fond of music. He sung agreeably, and played well on the harpsichord. His library was select rather than numerous, and particularly rich in good editions of the Greek and Latin classics. He had also a considerable and very valuable cabinet of ancient coins and rare medals, engraved stones, cameos, and a few statues.\n",

      "the founder of Phrenology, as it is now called, was descended of a respectable family residing at Tiefenbrunn, two leagues distant from Pforzheim, in Suabia, and born on the 9th of March 1757. His father was a shopkeeper or merchant, and mayor of the village. His parents, who were of the Roman Catholic persuasion, originally intended him for holy orders; but his natural dispositions were adverse to such a destination. He pursued his studies first at Baden, then at Brucksal, and afterwards at Strasburg, where he completed his literary education. Having resolved to study medicine with a view to the practice of physic, he, in 1781, proceeded to Vienna, the medical school of that capital having acquired great celebrity, particularly since the times of Van Swieten and Stoll; and, after passing through the ordinary course, he took his degree.\n",
      "Being early given to observation, Gall, whilst yet a boy, was struck with the fact, that each of his companions and schoolfellows possessed some peculiarity of talent which distinguished him from the others. One excelled in penmanship, another in arithmetic, a third in the acquisition of languages. The compositions of some were remarkable for elegance, whilst those of others were hard, stiff, formal, and dry; several connected their reasonings in the closest manner, and clothed their arguments in forcible language; many were devoid of the talent for logical arrangement, and incapable of expressing themselves with clearness and precision. Nor were their dispositions less various than their intellectual endowments. Not a few manifested a capacity for employments which they had not been taught, such as cutting figures in wood, or delineating them on paper; some devoted their leisure to drawing or gardening, whilst others abandoned themselves to noisy games, or traversed the woods to gather flowers, search for birds’ nests, or catch butterflies. In short, each presented a character peculiar to himself, and Gall did not observe that the individual who, one year, displayed selfish or knavish propensities, became a kind and faithful friend the next. Of ħis schoolfellows, those with whom he experienced the greatest difficulty in competing, were the boys who committed their lessons to memory with the greatest facility; and such individuals frequently gained from him by their repetitions the places which he had obtained by the merit of his original compositions. Several years afterwards, having changed his place of residence, and still meeting with individuals possessed of the same faculty, he observed that the individuals so gifted had all prominent eyes, and he also recollected that his rivals in the first school had been distinguished by the same peculiarity. On entering the university, he accordingly directed his attention to those students who had large eyes, and, upon inquiry, he found that they all excelled in committing pieces to memory and giving correct recitations, although many of them were by no means remarkable for general talent. As the coincidence thus observed was recognised by the other students in the classes, Gall conceived that it could not be entirely accidental; and hence, from this period, he seems to have come to the conclusion that they stood in an important relation to each other. But if verbal memory was thus indicated by an external sign, it required no great effort of generalization to conceive that the other intellectual powers might have each its appropriate manifestation. Proceeding on this idea or assumption, Gall now directed his attention to individuals distinguished by any remarkable faculty; and, after a course of observation, he conceived himself to have discovered and defined the external characteristics indicative of decided talents for painting, music, and the mechanical arts. Having also become acquainted with several persons remarkable for determination of character, he observed that a particular part of their heads was largely developed, and this development he 8et down as the external sign or ma* nifestation of the character referred to.\n",
      "His next step was to look in the head for the indications of the moral sentiments as well as of the intellectual faculties; but here he experienced considerable difficulties. Hitherto he had been ignorant of the opinions of physiologists concerning the brain, and of metaphysicians respecting the menial faculties; and, on turning to books, he became so much perplexed by the discordance of the views therein inculcated, that, for a time, he hesitated as to the correctness of his own observations. He found that, whilst Pythagoras, Plato, Galen, Haller, and others, placed the sentient sou] in the brain, Aristotle fixed its residence in the heart, Van Helmont in the stomach, Descartes in the pineal gland, and Drelincourt in the cerebellum; that, according to many philosophers and physiologists, all men are born with equal mental faculties; and that the differences observable amongst mankind are not ascribable to any original or constitutional inequality of powers, but the result partly of education, and partly of the diversified circumstances in which individuals are placed. But if all differences are accidental, it is evident that there can be no natural signs of predominating faculties, and, consequently, that the project of attempting, by observation, to discover the functions of the different portions of the brain, must be abandoned as hopeless. Sensible of this, Gall combated the difficulty by denying the truth of the doctrine of original equality on which it is founded. He contended that persons who have all received the same or very nearly the same education unfold each a distinct character, over which circumstances appear to exercise only a limited control; that individuals, whose education has been conducted with the greatest care, and on whom the labours of instructors have been most freely lavished, frequently remain far behind their companions in attainments; that many, even with the most ardent desire, followed out by the most persevering efforts, cannot, in some pursuits, attain even to mediocrity; that, in point of fact, instructors of youth do not appear to attach much faith to the system which teaches the equality of mental faculties, and think themselves entitled to exact more from one scholar and less from another; that the doctrine of Scripture, according to which, each will be required to render an account only in proportion to the gifts which he has received, serves to confirm this view, and is, moreover, in accordance with observation and experience. On these grounds, Dr Gall concluded that there is a natural and constitutional diversity of talents and dispositions amongst men; and that, supposing the exercise of the mental faculties dependent on the functions of the brain, the external signs of these faculties may be determined by observation.\n",
      "Abandoning every theory and preconceived opinion, therefore, he applied himself to the discovery of those signs of the existence of which he had thus satisfied his own mind. Being physician to a lunatic asylum at Vienna, he had opportunities of making observations on the insane; he visited prisons, and resorted to the seats of learning; he was introduced to the courts of princes and the tribunals ofjustice; wherever he heard of an individual remarkable either for his mental endowments or defects, he studied the development of his head; and at length he conceived himself warranted in maintaining that particular mental powers are indicated by particular configurationsof the shell or case in which the brain is lodged. Hitherto he had resorted only to physiognomical indications in order to discover the functions of the brain; but, being convinced that physiology is imperfect when separated from anatomy, he felt the necessity of instituting anatomical researches into the structure of the brain.^[1. Having observed a woman, aged fifty-four years, who from her youth had been afflicted with water in the head, yet possessed a mind as active and intelligent as that of any other individual of her class, Dr Gall declared his conviction that the structure of the brain must be different from what it was generally supposed to be; a conclusion which Tulpius had already drawn from observing a hydrocephalic patient, whose mental faculties remained unaffected by the disease under which he was labouring. This, and other analogous cases, convinced Dr Gall of the necessity of instituting minute anatomical researches into the structure and fonctions of the brain. ] Accordingly, in every instance where an individual whose head he had examined whilst alive happened to die, he used every means to obtain permission to examine the brain, and frequently did so; and he states it as a general fact, that, on the skull being removed, the brain, covered by the dura mater, presented a form corresponding to that which the skull had exhibited in life. Thus, by successive steps, by first observing a concomitance between particular talents and dispositions, and particular forms of the head, and next by ascertaining that the figure and size of the brain were indicated by these external forms, Dr Gall conceived that he had determined the intellectual dispositions corresponding to about twenty organs, or, in other words, ascertained the residences of as many intellectual faculties of the first order; and these organs he named according to the faculty or propensity which he attributed to each respectively. In short, he maintained that the intellectual dispositions being innate, have their seats in the brain, where the organs of the faculties are also situated; that the more prominent any isolated point on the skull is, the greater is the activity of the faculty, the organ of which is there placed; and that the part of the brain where such faculty resides and acts, by pressing on the skull, forms, on its convex surface, a protuberance, which indicates externally the organ, and is, in fact, its \n",

      "de, born at Synis, a sea-port in Portugal, was admiral of the fleet which first doubled the Cape of Good Hope in 1497, and arrived on the coast of India. The historians who have transmitted to us his discoveries, have contented themselves with informing us of the facts connected with his first voyage, and the establishment of the Portuguese in India, but they have left us in ignorance of the details of his private life. This is the more to be regretted, as Gama is one of those men who, by important discoveries, have contributed to the prosperity of their country and the increase of human knowledge. The progress of the art of navigation, and the desire of exploring our globe, excited by the prospect of gain, had about this time taken possession of the minds of men; and the success of the expedition of Christopher Columbus had given a fresh stimulus to this spirit of adventure. This extraordinary man had taught navigators the means of conducting themselves with safety across the ocean; and his example had encouraged them to brave all dangers. The Portuguese who, under the guidance of Prince Henry, had been the first to turn their views in this direction, observed with jealousy that the fruits of their researches were about to enrich the Spaniards, and they sought to indemnify themselves by pursuing, with more activity than ever, their discoveries on the side of Africa, in the hope of passing to the south of that continent, and penetrating into India, or into the kingdom of Abyssinia, of which they had acquired some notion by the relations which they maintained with the Moors. As they believed that the inhabitants of this last kingdom were Christians, they gave to the sovereign thereof the name of Prester John, by which people had hitherto designated a powerful prince whom they believed to be Christian, without, however, knowing where his dominions were to be found. It aj>pears, indeed, from what has been said on the subject, that this name has been applied to the great Khan of Tartary, and to the Grand Lama of Thibet, as well as to the king of Abyssinia. The existence of this Christian king was confirmed by Peter of Covilham, who, in 1487, had set out with Alphonse de Pai va, in order to reach India by the Red Sea. The latter, however, proceeded to Abyssinia, where he remained some time, but he died soon after his return to Cairo. Having visited Goa, Cananor, Calicut, and acquired some knowledge of the coast of Sofala, situated in the canal of Mozambique, Covilham, on returning to Cairo, found the narrative of Paiva’s voyage, which he transmitted to Portugal, together with an account of what he had himself done. He descended the Red Sea a second time, touched at Ormus, and lastly penetrated into Abyssinia, where he was detained during twenty years. His first voyage had been conceived on a very wise plan; and the information which he procured put him in a condition to enter the Indian Seas, with the certainty of deriving great advantages from such an enterprise, if it should only be found practicable to pass to the south of the continent of Africa. In fact, some knowledge had already been obtained of great cities in India, abounding in wealth derived from commerce; and it was also known that, on the eastern coast of Africa, at a great distance from the places where the Indian Sea might be entered, were commercial nations, amongst whom it would be possible to refit and procure pilots for proceeding further. Bartolomeo Diaz, having sailed from Lisbon in 1486, proceeded in search of the southern extremity of Africa, and had the good fortune to discover it. The storms which he had encountered, however, induced him to denominate the promontory by which the African continent is terminated, the Cape of Tempests; but this name was changed by the king of Portugal into that of the Cape of Good Hope, with the intention of obviating the unfavourable impression likely to be produced by a sinister name. Diaz returned to Lisbon in December 1487. There seemed now to be no obstacle calculated to prevent navigators entering the Indian Sea; but daring enterprises remain long in suspense, until men are found capable of carrying them into execution. It was not until five years after the discovery of the New World by Columbus, and ten years after that of the Cape of Good Hope by Diaz, that Emanuel king of Portugal resolved to send a fleet into India, and chose as its commander a gentleman of his own household, named Vasco de Gama, already known by his prudence, firmness, and ability in navigation.\n",
      "The expedition destined for this great enterprise consisted of three vessels, having on board as crews a hundred and sixty men. Vasco de Gama sailed from the Tagus on the 8th of July 1497. He first shaped his course toward*\n",
      "\n",
      "the Cape de Verd Islands, which he doubled, and making ' his way to the southward, anchored in the bay of St Helena, situated on the western coast of Africa, at a little distance to the north of the Cape of Good Hope. On the 16th of November he quitted this bay, and in two days after arrived at the extremity of Africa; but in attempting to make his way to the eastward, his little squadron had to contend with the south-eastern monsoon, which blows almost continually during that season of the year, and generally with great impetuosity. His crews, discouraged by the boisterous weather, attempted to force him to return; but he managed to allay their mutinous despondence, and by his firmness succeeded in overcoming all obstacles. He made to the eastward along the southern coast of Africa, stood in to the bay of St Blaise, and, on the 17th of December, arrived at the rock of Cruz, where Diaz had terminated his discoveries. It is at this point where the eastern coast of Africa begins to trend towards the north, and here the Portuguese for the first time entered the Indian Sea. Vasco de Gama, whose intention it was to go in quest of the countries which had been visited by Covilham, kept in sight of land; he proceeded northward, and several times sent his people to visit places where he observed inhabitants. He also went ashore himself as often as the population appeared considerable; but not finding any people who could give him information, he continued his voyage, passed the Cape of Currents, situated nearly under the tropics, and advanced beyond the coast of Sofala, including the city of that name, where Covilham was believed to have touched, but without discovering any establishment which could induce him to stop. At length, in one of the first days of March 1498, he anchored before the city of Mozambique, then inhabited by Moors or Mahommedan Arabs, who lived under the authority of a prince of their religion, and carried on a considerable trade with the Red Sea and the Indies. The hope of traflicking with the new-comers procured the Portuguese a favourable reception; but as soon as it became known that they were Christians, snares were laid for them, with the intention of massacring them. Obliged to withdraw from the perfidy of these fanatics, Gama set out from Mozambique, and sailed northward, along the coast for Quiloa, conducted by a pilot of Mozambique, whom he had carried along with him; but having approached the land to the north of that city, the currents prevented him from returning southward, and accordingly he veered away towards Monbaze, still following the line of the coast. This city, which was better built than Mozambique, and carried on a more extensive commerce, was also inhabited by Ma-ħommedan Moors, who evinced the same hostility towards the Portuguese as those of Mozambique had done. Gama therefore withdrew without obtaining any thing, and advancing eighteen leagues further, reached Melinda, which is only three degrees south of the equator. Here he was more fortunate. Although this city was also peopled with Mussulmans, commerce appeared to have softened their manners; the prince of the country gave the strangers a most favourable reception, and went on board the Portuguese squadron, where he was received with the greatest honours. At this place Gama obtained a pilot, one of the most skdful navigators of the country, called Malemo-Cana, an Indian of Guzerat, to conduct him to Calicut; and having left Melinda, he, in twenty-three days, reached the ⅛> un 'λ cast anchor before Calicut on the 20th of May 1498. Here Gama, as his custom was, sent ashore several of the convicts he carried along with him, accompanied by a Moor who happened to be on board his fleet, and who fortunately discovered a countryman of his own who was then m attendance at the court of Calicut. They were favourably received by the prince or zamorin, who granted the Portuguese permission to enter the port, and consented to receive Gama with the same honours which he rendered to the ambassadors of the greatest monarchs. But this good understanding was soon interrupted. The Mahommedan Moers and Arabs, inflamed with a tierce and bigoted hatred of all Christians, represented the strangers to the zamorin as pirates, who came to disturb the tranquillity of his dominions, with the intention of pillaging them. Distrust and suspicion were thus excited in the mind of the prince; and at length a plot was formed to burn the Portuguese ships and massacre their crews. Apprised of this design by Malemo-Cana, the pilot who had conducted him to Calicut, Gama, who had gone ashore, sent intelligence to his brother Paul de Gama, to be on his guard, and at the same time to keep a considerable offing; and having, by a rare mixture of firmness and address, managed to withdraw his people in safety, he immediately set sail, and having repaired his vessels at the Angedive Isles, situated on the coast to the north of Calicut, he proceeded on his return to Europe. In passing Melinda, he took on board an ambassador of the prince of that country, the only friend whom the Portuguese had yet acquired in India; and coasting along the African continent in the opposite di\n",

      "The term game, in a large sense, seems to comprehend all animals obtained by fowling and hunting, animals feroe naturoe, as contradistinguished to tame animals, such as horses, cows, sheep, and the like, which do not fly the dominion of man, but generally keep within the same pastures and closes; but in its stricter acceptation it applies only to those wild animals which the game laws and other arbitrary constitutions have distinguished by that appellation.\n",
      "The view taken on this subject by Judge Blackstone is this: By the law of nature, says he, every man, from the prince to the peasant, has an equal right of pursuing and taking to his own use all such creatures as are Jera: natur<e, and therefore the property of nobody, but liable to be seized by the first occupant; and so it was held by the imperial law even so late as the time of Justinian. But this right, like others of the same kind, may be restrained by positive laws, and we find has been so restrained by the municipal laws of many nations. Yet however defensible these provisions may in general be, on the footing of reason, or justice, or civil policy, we roust notwithstanding acknowledge, that in their present shape they owe their immediate origin to slavery, having been introduced into Europe along with the féodal system. On the Norman conquest, the right of pursuing and taking such animals as were accounted game was held to belong to the king, or to such only as were authorized by him. And this, the learned commentator says, as well upon the principles of the féodal law, that the king is the ultimate proprietor of all the lands in the kingdom, as upon another maxim of the common law, that these animals are bona vocantia, and, having no other owner, belong to the king by his prerogative. Wherefore, he concludes, all persons, of what property or distinction so-\n",
      "ever, who kill game without the king’s grant, are guilty of encroaching on the royal prerogative; and those persons who do so without having what is called a qualification, are guilty not only of the original offence, but also of the aggravations created by the statutes for preserving the game; which aggravations are so severely punished, and those punishments so implacably inflicted, that the offence against the king is seldom thought of, provided the miserable delinquent can make his peace with the lord of the manor.\n",
      "The doctrine thus promulgated, novel and startling as it was, maintained itself long on the mere name and reputation of the author. It is now, however, admitted to be incorrect. The law of Canute, noticed by Blackstone, “quilibet homo dignus venatione sua, in sylva et in agris sibi propriis et in dominio suo,” was confirmed by many succeeding kings; and there is no instance, civil or criminal, in which a person has been sued or prosecuted on behalf of the king for taking game, unless he took it out of some privileged place. On the contrary, there is a current of dicta and decisions showing that owners of land have uniformly been considered as having a local property in game, and a right to take it whilst upon their own land.\n",
      "However, the legislative provisions are in restraint of the common law right; and these provisions were till lately many and various, and not a little obscure and intricate. But in October 1831 an important act was passed to amend the laws of England relative to game, namely, 1 and 2 Gul. IV. c. 32, which repealed about thirty previous statutes on the subject, and, excepting as to game certificates, may be looked upon as containing nearly the whole law in relation to game.\n",
      "This statute of William begins by enacting that the word game shall, for all the purposes of the act, be deemed to include hares, pheasants, partridges, grouse, heath or moor game, black game, and bustards. It then sets out the days and times during which game shall not be killed, declaring that if any person shall kill or take any game, or use any dog, gun, net, or other engine or instrument for the purpose of killing or taking any game on a Sunday or Christmas day, he shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay, for every such offence, such sum of money, not exceeding L-5, as to the justices shall seem meet, together with the costs of conviction; and prohibiting, under a penalty, the killing or taking any partridge between 1st February and 1st September; pheasant between 1st February and 1st October; black game (except in the county of Somerset or Devon, or in the new Forest of Southampton) between 10th December and 20th August, or in the above excepted places between 10th December and 1st September; grouse or red game between 10th December and 12th August, or any bustard between 1st March and 1st September; and it further declares, that if any person, with intent to destroy or injure any game, shall at any time put any poison or poisonous ingredient on any ground, whether open or enclosed, where game usually resort, or in any highway, every such person shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay such sum of money, not exceeding L.10, as to the justices shall seem meet, together with the costs of conviction; and further, that if any person licensed to deal in game shall buy or sell, or knowingly have in his house, shop, stall, possession, or control, any bird of game after the expiration of ten days (one inclusive and the other exclusive) from the respective days in each year on which it shall become unlawful to kill or take such birds of game respectively as aforesaid, or if any person not being licensed to deal in game, shall buy or sell any bird of game after the expiration of ten days from the respective days in each year on which it shall become unlawful to kill or take such birds of game respectively as aforesaid, or shall knowingly have in his house, possession, or control any bird of game (except birds of game kept in a mew or breeding plaċe) after the expiration of forty days (one inclusive and the other exclusive) from the respective days in each year on which it shall become unlawful to kill or take such birds of game respectively as aforesaid, every such person shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay, for every head of game so bought or sold, or found in his house, shop, possession, or control, such sum of money, not exceeding L.l, as to the justices shall seem meet, together with the costs of conviction. The act then provides that the same, except as therein mentioned, shall not affect or alter the laws respecting game certificates ; and declares that all regulations and provisions contained in any act relative to game certificates, as far as they relate to gamekeepers of manors, and to the amount of duty for game certificates to be charged upon or in respect of gamekeepers of manors in the cases specified in such act, shall apply to all gamekeepers of lands appointed under this act; and it furtherdeclares, that every person who shall have obtained an annual game certificate shall be authorized to kill and take game, but subject to the law of trespass, and provided always that no game certificate on which a less duty than L.3.13s. 6d. is chargeable under the acts relating to game certificates shall authorize any gamekeeper to kill or take any game, or to use any dog, gun, net, or other engine or instrument, for the purpose of killing or taking game, except within the limits included in his appointment as gamekeeper; but that in any case where such gamekeeper shall kill or take any game, or use any dog, gun, net, or other engine or instrument, for the purpose of killing or taking game, beyond such limits, he may be proceeded against as if he had no game certificate whatsoever. Then follow certain clauses which determine the rights of landlords in relation to the game. The act declares, that in all cases where any person shall occupy any land under any lease or agreement made previously to the passing of the act, the lessor or landlord shall have the right of entering upon such land, or of authorizing any other person or persons who shall have obtained an annual game certificate to enter upon such land, for the purpose of killing or taking the game thereon; and no person occupying any land, under any lease or agreement, either for life or for years, made previously to the passing of this act, shall have the tight to kill or take the game on such land, except where the right of killing the game has been expressly allowed to such person by the lease or agreement, or except where, upon the original granting or removal of the same, a fine shall have been taken, or except where, in the case of a term for years, the lease or agreement shall have been made for a term exceeding twenty-one years; provided always that nothing contained in the act shall authorize any person seised or possessed of land to kill or take the game, or to permit any other to do so, where, by any deed, grant, lease, or any written or parole demise or contract, a right of entry on such land for the purpose of killing or taking the game has been or shall be reserved or retrieved by, or given or allowed to, the granter or other person whatsoever; nor shall the act affect any reservation or agreement already made in relation to game, nor in any manner prejudice the rights of manor, forest, chase, or warren, nor any of his majesty’s forest rights, nor the rights of any grantee of the crown; nor shall the act be deemed to give to any owner of cattlegates, or rights of common, upon or over any wastes or commons, any interest or privilege which he had not before, nor authorize him to pursue or kill the game found on such wastes or commons, nor defeat or diminish the rights and privileges of any lord, or of any steward of the crown, of any manor, lordship, or royalty, in or over such wastes or commons; but that the lord or steward of the crown, of any manor, &c. shall have the right to pursue and kill the game upon the wastes or commons therein, and to authorize any other person who shall have obtained an annual game certificate to en\n",

      "the art of playing or practising any game, particularly those of hazard, as cards, dice, tables, and so forth.\n",
      "Gaming was particularly remarked by Tacitus as distinguishing the ancient Germans. “They addict themselves,\" says he, in his treatise De Moribus Germ. c. 24, “to dice, as a serious employment, with such an extravagant desire to win or lose, that when everything else fails they will stake even their liberty and their very persons. The loser goes into a voluntary servitude: though younger and stronger than his antagonist, he suffers himself to be bound and sold; and this perseverance in so bad a cause they call the point of honour.” This passion we seem to have inherited; and by the ancient common law of the land it was not forbidden. Its pernicious consequences, however, are manifest; and both the legislature and the courts have interfered to restrain it.\n",
      "In England there are three principal statutes on the subject, and a multitude of minor ones, the particular descriptions and prohibitions of the law being ever behind the inventions of sharpers and interested men. The first statute, 33 Hen. VIII. c. 9, was directed against the inferior classes, and prohibits to all but gentlemen the games of tennis, tables, cards, dice, bowls, and other unlawful diversions therein specified, unless in the time of Christmas, under pecuniary pains and imprisonment. But this was legislation at once unequal, cruel, and impolitic, and indeed, according to modern experience at least, it is gaming in high life which particularly requires to be restrained. Accordingly, by 16 Car. II. c. 7, it was enacted that if any person shall play at any of the games mentioned in the second section, namely, cards, dice-tables, tennis, bowls, skittles, shovel-board, or cock-fighting, horse-races, dogmatches, foot-races, or other pastimes or games whatsoever, or shall bet on the side or hands of such as play thereat, and shall lose any sum or sums of money or other thing exceeding L.100, at any time or meeting upon ticket, credit, or otherwise, and shall not pay down the same at the time of the loss, the value shall not be recovered; but all contracts for the same, judgments, statutes, recognisances, mortgages, &c. and all other acts, deeds, and securities for the same, shall be void, and the winner shall forfeit treble the value, in addition to the sum of L.100, half thereof to the king and half to the informer. At length came the gaming act (9 Anne, c. 14), which declares that all bonds and other securities given for money won at play, or money lent at the time to play withal, shall be utterly void; that all mortgagee and incumbrances of lands made upon the same consideration shall be and revert to the use of  the heir of the mortgager; that if any person at any time or sitting loses L.10 at play, he may sue the winner, and recover it back by action of debt at law; and in case the loser does not, any other person may sue the winner for treble the sum so lost; and the plaintiff may by bill of equity examine the defendant himself on oath. Moreover, if any person, by cheating at play, shall win any money or valuable thing, or shall at any time or sitting win more than L.10, he may be indicted thereon, and shall forfeit five times the value to any person who will sue for it, and shall be deemed infamous, and suffer such corporal punishment as in the case of wilful perjury. And this statute of 9 Anne is further enforced, and some deficiencies supplied, by 18 Geo. II. c. 34.\n",
      "By the first of the above-named acts also (33 Hen. V∏l. c. 9), to which may now be added 58 Geo. III. c. 70, and\n",
      "3 Geo. IV. c. 114, the keeping a gaming-house was declared a nuisance, which indeed it is held to be, and an indictable offence at common law; and the courts largely construing the word, have held a cockpit a gaming-house within the meaning of the statute (3 Keb. 510, 2 Burr. 1233). By 9 and 10 Will. III. c. 17, all lotteries were declared public nuisances; and all state-lotteries which had in the interval been allowed were to be discontinued after\n",
      "4 Geo. IV. c. 60. As to private lotteries, they were prohibited by various statutes of the reign of George II. under heavy pecuniary penalties. In the same reign, to prevent or restrain horse-racing, another kind of gaming, it was enacted by 13 Geo. II. c. 19, that no plate or match under LAO value shall be run, under a penalty of L.200 to be paid by the owner of each horse running, and L.100 by such as advertise the plate, except at Newmarket and Black Hambleton, where a race may be run for a less sum than LAO: but though such horse-races are lawful, yet they are construed games within 9 Anne c. 14, and consequently wagers above L.10 are illegal. By 7 Geo. II. wagers relating to the present or future price of stocks are declared illegal and void; and it has been held that a wager between two electors upon the success of their respective parliamentary candidates is illegal, because it tends to corrupt the freedom of election (1 T. R. 56). The law of wagers is well and succinctly traced by Mr Christian in his note to 4 Blackstone, 173. Wagers, in general, says he, were by the common law lawful contracts; and all wagers may still be recovered in a court of justice which are not made upon unlawful games, or which are not such as are likely to disturb the public peace, or to encourage immorality, or such as will probably affect the interests, characters, and feelings of persons not parties to the wager, or such as are contrary to sound policy or the general interests of the community. And the recent editor of Blackstone subjoins to this note a case lately decided, to show the comprehensive ground on which one of these doctrines, that of public policy, rests. The case was this. In 1802 the defendant, in consideration of 100 guineas, agreed to pay the plaintiff one guinea a day during the life of Bonaparte. The defendant paid the money for some years, and then stopped. The action was brought to recover the arrears. The jury having found for the defendant, on a motion for a new trial it was contended in support of the verdict that the wager was illegal, inasmuch as it had a tendency to create an interest in the plaintiff in the life of a foreign enemy, and which in the case of an invasion might induce him to act contrary to his allegiance. The court being of opinion that the justice of the case had been satisfied, refused to disturb the verdict; and Lord Ellenborough, chief-justice, expressed a strong opinion against the legality of the wager, as well on the ground before mentioned, as also on the ground that the party suffering under such a contract might be induced to compass and encourage the horrid practice of assassination, in order to get rid of a life so burdensome to him ( 16 East. 150). So likewise, where a person had given L.100 on condition of receiving LA00 if peace were not concluded with France within a certain time, and he afterwards brought his action to recover the L.300, it was held that the wager was void, as being inconsistent with general policy; but he was allowed to recover the L.100 which he had paid, under a count for so much money received by the defendant to his use. Indeed we may remark frequent expressions of regret by the most eminent judges of England, that the law of wagers in that country is not the same witlι that of Scotland; and some, amongst whom was Justice Butler (3 T. R. 697), have thought it was not too late yet to retrace their steps, and to adopt the practice of the Scotch couru. So in Easter term 1825, Chief-Justice Abbot refused to allow a cause to proceed in which a person sought to recover L.100 which had been deposited as a stake on a dog-fight, observing that all such wagers were illegal. In like manner, the chief-justice discharged the jury from giving any verdict in an action to recover a deposit on a wrestling match (Kennedy, K. B. October 29, 1828).\n",
      "The view taken in Scotland is, that courts of justice were instituted to redress wrong in the serious transactions of life; and that wagers and gaming debts do not partake of the character of serious business, but mere pastime and amusement. The judges therefore look upon such contracts as sponsiones ludicra, and will not allow action for the recovery of sums lost or won by wagering or betting in any form; and this is now settled law, and sanctioned by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Bruce v. Ross, 14th February 1788. Where, however, a civil injury arises, though it be out of gaming, the party will be heard. So, in the case of Paterson, 1830 (8 Sh. and D. 573), a party brought an action setting forth that he had fairly won money at cards from the defender, who paid it, but afterwards demanded restitution, alleging the pursuer was a cheat at play; and that the pursuer thereupon repaid the money on condition that the defender should preserve silence on the subject, which he failed to do; and the defender offered to prove the pursuer a cheat. The court found the action relevant, and remitted it to the jury court, where it was tried as a question of defamation.\n",
      "Scotland is also distinguished from England by the paucity of its legislative provisions on gaming. By 1621, c. 14, it was enacted that none play at cards or dice in any common house, town, hostelrie, or cook’s house, and that it should not be lawful to play in any other private man’s house but where the master of the family playeth himself; and if it should happen any man to win a sum exceeding 100 merks within the space of twenty-four hours, or to gain at wagers upon horse-races any sum above 100 merks, the surplus should go to the poor of the parish. This act is not altogether in desuetude, as might be thought from an old case, but it is available only to the poor, and not to the winner (Straiton, 19th July 1688; Maxwell, 14th July 1774). To the above act of 1621 are to be added the acts 9 Anne anti 18 Geo. II. above noticed, which are received in Scotlan\n",

      "oγGarcilasso de I∙ a 1 Y∞ a ∙ “ce ' ebra , ted s P a ≡h poet, was born at Toledo, in 1503. He was the younger son of Garcilaso, counsellor ot state to terdιnand and Isabella, their ambassador at the court of Rome, and grand commander of Leon, and of Sanchette de Guzman, lady of Batres, a considerable property of the illustrious house of Guzman, where may yet be seen a fountain which has existed for several centuries, and still bears the name of Garci)aso. Ferdinand V. conferred on the father of Garcilaso the name of Vega, in memory of a single combat which the former maintained against one of the most valiant of the Moors on the Vega, or plain of Grenada; and which was celebrated in the Spanish romances and histories of that age. Garcilaso was intended by nature for a rural and solitary life, at least if a judgment may be formed from his poetical productions, which all breathe nothing but love and peace, and manifest extreme gentleness of character. But his birth having called him to the profession of arms, his life was passed in camps, and his career was brilliant and tumultuous. He entered early into the army of Charles V., followed that monarch in the war of the Milanese (1521), and, though still young, distinguished himself by his valour, particularly at the battle of Pavia. In 1523 he served in the Spanish corps, which, having joined the imperial army, distinguished itself by its bravery against the Turks. In acknowledgment of his courage, Charles V. conferred on him, at Vienna, the cross of the order of St James. Garcilaso, by his merit, established himself in the good graces of the emperor; but a gallant adventure for ever deprived him of the favour which his talents and bravery had won. One of his cousins having become enamoured of a lady of the court, who, it seems, had gained the affections of Charles, Garcilaso favoured by all means in his power the passion of his relation, whose intentions were honourable. When the fact became known to the emperor, he sent the cousin into exile, and banished Garcilaso to an island in the Danube. During his detention, which was not of long duration, the latter composed one of his Condones, in which he deplores his misfortune, and at the same time celebrates the charms of the country watered by the divine stream of the Danube (Danubio rio divino). In 1535, he served in the expedition which Charles V. undertook against Tunis, whence he brought back nothing but wounds and glory. He then passed some time in Naples and in Sicily, where he indulged in his favourite occupation of poetry. Pouring out maledictions on war, as the bane of nations and the destroyer of human happiness, he pleased himself with creating an imaginary romantic Arcadia, free from all the passions, tumults, and anxieties which distract men in this every-day common-place world; but notwithstanding these benign and peaceful pictures painted by his fancy, he still remained the soldier, and, in addition to his acknowledged courage, evinced considerable military talents. Hence, in 1536, he marched with the imperial army into France, having under his orders thirty companies of Spanish troops. But this was the last campaign of Garcilaso, who, in the disastrous retreat from Marseilles, found a death worthy of his valour. A number of French peasants having occupied a tower, whence they greatly annoyed the imperial army on its retreat, the emperor ordered Garcilaso to carry it by assault. He obeyed, but executing his order with less prudence than valour, he mounted the first to the assault, and was overthrown by a mass of stone, which struck him on the head, and inflicted a mortal wound. He was conveyed in this state to Nice, where, after lingering twenty hours in great agony, he expired in November 1536, being then in the thirty-third year of his age. Arms and letters sincerely deplored his loss; and the emperor himself was so touched, that when the tower had been carried, he caused twenty-eight peasants who remained out of the fifty who formed its garrison to be hanged on the spot where the poet-soldier had fallen. At the age of twenty-eight Garcilaso had married an Aragonese lady, Doña Helena de Zuniga, by whom he had a son, who, like his father, fell in the flower of his age (1569), in a combat with the Dutch.\n",
      "Although the military career of Garcilaso is not without glory, yet he owes his refutation to his literary merit, more especially to the reformation he effected in Spanish poetry, and which forms an epoch in the age in which he lived. For several centuries before the birth of Garcilaso, the Spaniards possessed a species of poetry.^[1. Colcceion de Poesias Castellanas anteriores al Siglo xv. by Don Antonio Sanchez, Madrid, 1782, in 4 vols. 8vo. In this colleetion are contained the poem of the Cid, written towards the middle of the eleventh century; that of Alexander the Great, which belongs to the twelfth; the pieces of the archpries of Fits, who lived at the commencement of the thirteenth; and the poems of Barceo, who died in 1268. ] The first known compositions were romances, produced probably in the mountains of Asturias; and the first people amongst whom a less rude and incorrect kind of poetry appeared, were the Valencians and the Catalans, who wrote in their own particular language. The last of these troubadours was Jago Roig, who died at the commencement of the fifteenth century.^[2. Los Dones de Roig, Valentia. 1735, in 4to. ] In the kingdoms of Leon and Aragon, where the Castillian dialect prevailed, the only poetical compositions at first known were these romances, composed of redondillas or assonantes, ^[3. The redondillas consist of four verses, in which there is an exact and full rhyme, as razon, eorazon, called consonante. The assonante is the echo of the final vowel, and not of the final consonant of the verse to which it corresponds, as sano, raso, claro, &c. when the romance is composed of redondillas, these change rhymes successively; but when it is composed of assonants, a single vowel predominates throughout the whole romance. ] each verse being subjected to a measure consisting of four trochees. Much about the same time appeared the verses of the Arte Mayor, composed of twelve syllables, like the following, in which Alfonso the Wise relates that he had learned from a celebrated alchemist how to make the philosopher’s stone, by means of which he had been enabled to augment his revenues:\n",
      "La piedra que Haman philosophical. Sabia fazer, e mi la ensennδ.. h'izimoβ la juntos, despues solo yí>.. Con que ιnuchas veceβ cresciò mi caudâl.\n",
      "In the same century, that is, about the middle of the thirteenth, a Benedictine named Barceo introduced the verses called Martelliani by the Italians, and Alexandrine by the French:\n",
      "Quiero far una prosa en roman paladino En el quai suele el pueblo hablar a su vecino.\n",
      "But this metre has for a long time fallen into almost total disuse, except in Spain. In fact, it was only under the reign of John II. a great protector of letters, who swayed the sceptre from 1401 to 1454, that Spanish poetry assumed a character truly national. This prince collected around him the ablest Valentian troubadours, and the most renowned Castillian poets; and it was then that the learned Marquis of Villenas, John of Mena, the Marquis Mendoza of Santillane, John of the Encina, and others, appeared, and that versification was subjected to some rules, conformably to the precepts laid down in Arts of Poetry composed by the two authors last named. But this versification was still very rude, when Dante, Petrarch, and Sannazaro had already made themselves admired in Italy and in all Europe, by the excellence and beauty of their compositions. At length came Boscan and Garcilaso, who, united from their earliest infancy in the closest friendship, and alike sensible of the merit of the three great Italian poets, the perusal of whose works had formed at once their taste and their understanding, resolved to effect a general reform in the bad taste which still prevailed in their own country. Boscan was the first to enter the field. He introduced the sonnet, the eanzoni, the stanze, and the endecasyllabic measure of the Italians; and his efforts were crowned with success. Garcilaso merely followed Boscan, but, on the other hand, he had the talent to surpass him, and approached more nearly to the sweetness and softness of Petrarch, whilst his rival imitated the precision and energy of Dante. All the contemporary poets united in opposing a reform the success of which would infer their condemnation; but although they evoked the shades of their illustrious predecessors, the genius of the two wise innovators triumphed over their cabals. Garcilaso and Boscan obtained the title of Fathers of the Good School; Garcilaso was named the Spanish Petrarch, the Prince of Spanish Poetry; and the desired reform was effected. It was followed by good imitators,^[4. These imitators, in adopting the Italian metres introduced by Boβcan and Garcilaso, have nevertheless preserved their redondillas, their assonantes, and their octavés, which had been known in Spain since the fourteenth century. ] till the apparition of Andalous Gongora, who appeared to have undertaken the task of banishing for ever good taste from his country; but, in spite of all his efforts, and those of his partisans, under the reign of Charles V. and the three Philips, his successors, Spain was fertile in good poets; and, in recent times, Iriarte, Cienfuegos, Moralin, Arellano, Quintana, and, above all, Melendez-Valdez, have enabled their countrymen to taste the delights of true poetry. Boscan, who survived Garcilaso six years, collected the works of the latter; but death surprised him before he was enabled to give them to the world. The first known edition is that of Venice, 1553, in 8vo. The celebrated grammarian Sanchez, called in Latin Sanctius, had corrected what he found defective in the oldest edition; but the most esteemed edition is that of M\n",

      "an English prelate of considerable talents, but of a temporising and interested character, was the son of John Gauden, vicar of Mayfield in Essex, where he was born in the year 1605. Having received the rudiments of his education at Bury St Edmund’s in Suffolk, he was removed to St John’s College, Cambridge, where he made considerable proficiency in learning, and took his degree in arts. About 1630 he was presented to the vicarage of Chippenham in Cambridgeshire, and he also obtained the rectory of Brightwell in Berkshire. This last preferment having brought him near Oxford, he entered himself of Wadham College in that university, and became tutor to some noblemen and several young gentlemen who were placed under his care. In 1635, he took his degree as bachelor in divinity, and in 1641 he was received as doctor in the theological faculty. At the commencement of the civil war he had become chaplain to the Earl of Warwick, a Presbyterian leader; and having ranged himself on the same side as his patron, he, in the end of November, after the close imprisonment of Lord Strafford, preached a sermon before the House of Commons, which proved so agreeable to that assembly, that it is said they presented him with a large silver tankard, bearing the inscription, Donum honorarium populi Angli-cani in Parliamento congregati, Johanni Gauden ; a token of their esteem, which, if the story be true, may seem to be the stronger for its singularity and unseemliness.^[1. ' fhe journals make no mention of the tankard, but bear “that the thanks of this house be given to Mr Gaudy and Mr Morley for their sermons last Sunday, and that they be desired, if they please, to print the same.” {Cam. Journ. ii. 40.) ] His discourse seems to have consisted of an invective against the ecclesiastical policy of the court; and it was not only preached at a critical time, but on the solemn occasion of the sacrament being first taken by the whole house. As a reward for so conspicuous a service to the parliamentary cause, he soon afterwards received the valuable living of Bocking in Essex, which he held through all the succeeding changes of government; forbearing of necessity to use the liturgy, and complying with all the conditions which the law then required from the beneficed clergy. He was also chosen one of the assembly of divines who met at Westminster in 1643; but it has been disputed whether he took the covenant, though his own evasive answers seem rather to confirm the opinion that he had. It is said that he wrote a Protestation against the trial of the king in 1648, and likewise an Invective against those of the army and their abettors who murdered Charles I.; but neither of these pieces was published until two years after the Restoration; and even if the former had appeared at the needful time, it would have been disregarded, seeing that the solemn declaration of all the Presbyterian clergy of London against bringing Charles to trial had proved unavailing.\n",
      "But the most remarkable production with which the name of Gauden has been connected is the famous E∕xmi ∣ BαΛλjχi1, or Portraiture of his Sacred Majesty in his Solitude and Sufferings, which appeared after the execution of Charles I., and in the course of a year passed through filly editions. The Eihon Basìliké seems to have been intended to produce a favourable effect during the king’s trial; but its publication was retarded until some days after his death, by the jealous and rigorous precautions adopted by the regicides. The impression made on the public by a work which purported to convey the pious and eloquent language of a dying king could not fail to be very considerable; and though its genuineness was from the beginning doubted or disbelieved by some, including Milton, Goodwyn, and Lilly, yet unbounded faith in its authenticity as the production of Charles himself soon became one of the fundamental articles of the royalist creed. At the Restoration, Gauden was promoted to the see of Exeter, whence he was in 1662 translated to that of Worcester. But he was so far from being satisfied with this promotion, that he looked upon it as an act of injustice. He had, it appears, applied to the king for the rich bishopric of Winchester, which he flattered himself with the hopes of obtaining; and, when he failed, the vexation he suffered on account of this disappointment is believed to have hastened his death, which took place on the 20th of September 1662. Gauden was the author of many controversial pieces, suited to the temper of the times, and to his own views, which were always those of a selfish and temporising divine.\n",
      "The question, Who wrote the Eikon Basilikėĩ which Gauden published as King Charles’s private meditations, has, as our readers must be aware, been long agitated; but the controversy seems at length to have been ended by a verdict upon the whole case in favour of Gauden as the author. At the moment of the Restoration, this complying person, who had thundered before the parliament against the ecclesiastical policy of the court, appears to have had as little public claim on the favour of Charles II. as any clergyman who had conformed to the religious principles of the parliament and the protectorate; and he was accordingly stigmatized by some zealous royalists as “the false apostate.” He was sufficiently a Presbyterian in party to make him no favourite with the court; yet he was not so decided a Presbyterian in principle as to have that influence amongst his party which could make him worth so high a price as a mitre. Those who dispute his claim to be acknowledged as the writer of the Eikon, will not ascribe his preferment to transcendent abilities; he is not mentioned as having ever shown kindness to the royalists; there is no trace of his having corresponded with the exiled court; he contributed nothing to the recall of the king, nor indeed had he the power of performing such atoning services. Yet, though thus without the shadow of a claim to preferment on any public ground, and indeed one of the last persons whom the court might be supposed to have been inclined to promote, Gauden was, nevertheless, on the 3d of November 1660, appointed Bishop of Exeter, and, in a few months, he received no less than L.20,000 for the renewal of leases. Nor was he at all satisfied with this advancement In fact, he had scarcely arrived at his episcopal palace, when, on the 21st of December, he wrote a letter to Lord Chancellor Clarendon, complaining bitterly of the “distress, infelicity, and horror” of such a bishopric, and lamenting “a hard fate which,” he reminds the chancellor, he “had before deprecated.” “I am not so unconscious,\" he adds, “to the service done to the church and to his Majesty’s family, as to bear with patience the ruin heaped on me. Are these the effects of his liberal expressions, who told me I might have what I would desire ?” Five days afterwards (26th December 1660) he wrote another letter, in which he says, “Dr Morley once offered me my option, upon account of some service which he thought I had done extraordinary for the church and royal family, of which he told me your Lordship was informed.” Gauden appears soon afterwards to have written to Sir E. Nicholas, secretary of state, a letter expressed so as to be read by the king; and on the 19th January 1661, he received an answer, in which there is the following sentence: “As for your own particular, he (the king) desires you not to be discouraged at the poverty of your bishopric at present, and if that answer not the expense that was promised you, his Majesty will take you so particularly into his care, that he bids me assure you shall have no cause to remember Bocking.” On the 21st of January the importunate prelate again addressed to Clarendon a letter explicitly stating the nature of the services, which was probably rendered necessary, in his opinion, by the continued silence of the chancellor, and distinctly claiming “what goes under the late blessed king’s name, the or Portraiture of hys Majesty in hys Solitudes and Sufferings,\" as his own production. “This book and figure,” he says, “was wholly and only my invention, making, and designe, in order to vindicate the king’s wisdome, honor, and piety. My wife indeed was conscious to it, and had an hand in disguising the letters of that copy which I sent to the king in the Isle of Wight by favour of the late Marquise of Hertford, which was delivered to the king by the now Bishop of Winchester (Duppa): hys majesty graciously accepted, owned, and adopted it as hys sense and genius, not only with great approbation, but admiration. Hee kept it with hym; and though hys cruel murtherers went on to perfect hys martyrdome, yet God preserved and prospered the book to revive hys honor, and to redeeme hys majesty’s name from that grave of contempt and abhorrence or infamy, in which they aymed to bring hym.” The bishop wrote three more letters to Clarendon on the 25th January, the 20th February, and the 6th March; and, at last, the chancellor replied to his numerous applications in a letter dated the 13th of March 1661, in which Gauden's claim is unequivocally admitted. After many apologies for delay, and professions of good will towards his importunate correspondent, Clarendon says, “The particular which you often renewed, I do confesse was imparted to me under secrecy, and of which I did not take myself to be at liberty to take notice, and truly, when it ceases to be a SECRET, I know nobody will be gladd of it but Mr Milton ; I have very often wished I had never been trusted with it.”\n",
      "Now this, taken in conjunction with Gauden’s immediate promotion to the episcopal dignity after the Restoration, and the letter of the secretary of state, Sir E. Nicholas, above referred to, appears to us to be decisive of the whole question as to the authorship of the Eikon. “It is proper to remark here,” says Sir James Mackintosh,^[2.

      "a learned Scotch Catholic divine and eminent biblical critic, was born in the parish of Ruthven in Banffshire, in the year 1737. His parents were respectable, although not opulent. His father was a farmer, who deemed no trouble too great in order to procure for bis children as liberal an education as possible. Both father and mother were of the Catholic persuasion, and the only book of consequence which the former had in his library was an English translation of the Bible, in which young Geddes was instructed with such care and attention that he was able to give an account of the history of it before he had reached the eleventh year of his age. The first instructions he received, after those of his parents, were communicated by a school-mistress in the vicinity, by whom he was so much distinguished that it became the first mental gratification which, in his own opinion, he ever felt. He was next placed under the tuition of a young man from the city of Aberdeen, who had been engaged by a proprietor for the education of his own children; and afterwards went to a place called Scalan, in the Highlands, where those were to be trained up who designed to devote themselves to the Catholic priesthood, and to finish their education at some foreign university. Here it was, in this obscure retreat, that Geddes laid the foundation of that intimate acquaintance with the learned languages by which he was so eminently distinguished in the subsequent part of his life. He went to the Scotch university at Faris in the year 1758, and soon afterwards began the study of rhetoric in the college of\n",
      "Navarre. By the strength of his genius, and his indefatigable attention, he soon reached the head of this class, although he had to contend with two veterans; and became the favourite of Vicaire, the professor, whose friendship lasted till the close of his life.\n",
      "Instead of entering into the philosophical class at the usual time, Geddes studied that subject at home, in order to facilitate his theological studies, on which he entered under M Μ. Buré and de Sauvent, at the college of Navarre; whilst Lavocat at the Sorbonne was his Hebrew preceptor. His progress in the oriental languages was so great that Professor Lavocat urged him strongly to continue at Paris; but his friends prevailed with him to return to his native country in 1764. His first charge as a priest was in a Catholic chapel in the county of Angus, from which he removed to Traquair in 1765, and became chaplain to the earl of that name, where he remained for about three years. This situation was most agreeable to his literary pursuits, as he had unlimited access to an extensive library, which greatly assisted him in the prosecution of his favourite studies. He left the earl’s house in the year 1768, and returned to Paris, where he devoted his time during the following winter to the perusal of books and manuscripts in the king’s libraries, making large extracts from scarce copies, particularly such as were in the Hebrew tongue.\n",
      "In the spring of 1769 he returned to his native country, and became pastor of a congregation at Auchinhalrig, in Banffshire, where he was for some time involved in pecuniary difficulties, out of which he was extricated by the liberality of the Duke of Norfolk. These were occasioned by the debts he incurred in building a new chapel for his flock, and in making the parsonage house one of the neatest and most convenient in Scotland. With the view of bettering his circumstances he commenced farmer; but as he had to borrow money to stock his farm, and as the crops failed for three successive seasons, he was under the necessity of abandoning this scheme in a much poorer condition than when he first projected it. His unwearied exertions, however, joined to the assistance of friends, again relieved him, and he was enabled to discharge in an honourable manner every claim against him of a pecuniary nature.\n",
      "In the year 1779 he resigned his pastoral charge at Auchinhalrig, which was a heavy blow to the members of his congregation, as the zeal and diligence with which he discharged the duties of his ministerial function had endeared him to all. He was also justly esteemed for his attention to the instruction of youth. Next year the university of Aberdeen conferred on him the degree of doctor of laws, a literary honour which had never been bestowed by that body on any Roman Catholic since the Reformation. He afterwards went to London that he might prosecute his favourite studies with greater facility, and give the world his English translation of the Old and New Testament, to which he had turned his attention for a number of years. He officiated for some months after his arrival at the imperial ambassador’s chapel in Duke Street, until the term of Easter 1782, when it was suppressed by order of the Emperor Joseph II., after which Dr Geddes seems to have declined entirely the exercise of his clerical functions.\n",
      "No sooner had the design of Dr Geddes, relative to a new translation of the Bible, been made public, than he met with formidable opposition from his Catholic brethren; an event which the doctor seems with good reason to have anticipated. His own words on this occasion were, “I expect not excessive profits from excessive exertion. I trust I shall never want meat, and clothes, and fire; to a philosophical and contented mind, what more is necessary ?” He was many years employed in preparing this important work for the press before he had any prospect of adequate success. In addressing the English Catholics on the subject of his translation, he says, “At any rate, I do what I think it my duty to do, and do it fairly and openly. In the following pages ye will find neither palliation nor disguise. I pour out my sentiments with the same sincerity as if I were before the tribunal of Him who is to judge the living and the dead. Mistake I may, but prevaricate I never will.” He discovered this noble spirit in every action of his life, and in all his transactions and intercourse with mankind, although he did not conciliate the regard of those who could have bestowed upon him the most effectual assistance.\n",
      "After spending much of his life in biblical studies, he met with a long and cruel interruption. “I had but little hope of ever living in a situation to resume them,” says he, “when Providence threw me into the arms of such a patron as Origen himself might have been proud to boast of; a patron who, for these ten years past, has, with a dignity peculiar to himself, afforded me every convenience that my heart could desire towards the carrying on and completing of my arduous work.” It is needless to inform the public, that the patron to whom the learned doctor here alludes was Lord Petre. For this munificence, continued throughout the whole of his life, and even beyond it by his will, Christians of every denomination will feel sentiments of gratitude, if they are qualified to form a true estimate of the advantages of free and impartial inquiry. His prospectus of a new translation of the Bible in 4to was published in 1786, and a letter to the Bishop of London on the same subject appeared in 1787. His proposals were printed in 1788.\n",
      "In the year 1792 the first volume of this translation was published, dedicated to his patron Lord Petre, containing the first six books of the Old Testament. Soon after this volume made its appearance, three apostolic vicars, calling themselves the Bishops of Rama, Acanthos, and Centuriae, issued a pastoral letter, addressed to their respective flocks over which they presided, warning them against the reception of Dr Geddes’ translation. In his reply to the Bishop of Centuriae we find these words: “Perhaps, my lord, you wish to have another occasion of exercising your episcopal authority, and of playing with censures as children do with a new ball. I wish your lordship much joy of the bauble; but however, my lord, beware of playing too often with it. Read St Chrysostom on ecclesiastical censures, and learn from him a little more moderation. Permit an old priest to tell you that it is a very great ornament in a young bishop. As to myself, my lord, I am not afraid of your threats, and shall laugh at your censures as long as I am conscious that I deserve them not. You cannot hinder me from praying at home; and at home I will pray, in defiance of your censure, as often as I please. The Chief Bishop of our souls is always accessible; and through him I can, at all times, have free access to the Father, who will not reject me, but for voluntary unrepented crimes. In the panoply of conscious innocence, the whole thunder of the Vatican would in vain be levelled at my head.”\n",
      "The second volume of his translation, owing to a variety of interruptions, did not make its appearance till the year 1797, to which was prefixed a dedication to her royal highness the Duchess of Gloucester, as an early, spontaneous, and liberal encourager of the work. In this volume the doctor gives up, and boldly combats, the absolute inspiration of Scripture, believing that the Hebrew, like all other historians, wrote from such human documents as they could find, and were of consequence liable to similar mistakes. This latitude of thinking naturally led the doctor to give up as fabulous, and wholly unworthy of the divine benevolence, every command, precept, and injunction, which appeared unworthy even of human authority. He denied, of consequence, that the command given to destroy the Canaanites could havę had God for its author.\n",
      "Dr Geddes was a man of extensive literature, uncommon liberality of thinking, and the friend of all mankind; a man of integrity, honour, and benevolence; in the strictest sense of the word a genuine Catholic, one whose love of truth was so invincible, that neither hopes nor fears could induce him to conceal it.\n",
      "As a controversial writer, Dr Geddes was eminently distinguished by his letter to Dr Priestley, in defence of the divinity of Jesus Christ; and by one to \n",

      "----\n",
      "an eminent Italian writer, was born on the 1st of November 1712, at Castiglione, near Salerno, in the kingdom of Naples. From his earliest years he showed an uncommon capacity; but after receiving such education as his native village could afford, his father obliged him to devote himself to the study of scholastic theology, with a view to the ecclesiastical profession. In a short time he distinguished himself as a proficient in dialectics; but having formed an attachment to a young woman, he was on the point of sacrificing to her all his professional prospects, when his father, who had obtained a knowledge of the circumstance, removed him to another village, where he found a priest who diverted his attention to different objects. Having been afterwards excommunicated by the Archbishop of Conza, for acting a part in a comedy, he returned to Castiglione, where, having found his mistress married, he re-assumed the cassock, and took priest’s orders at Salerno in 1736. Here he soon distinguished himself so much by his talents and knowledge, that the archbishop of this town confided to him the chair of eloquence. At this period Genovesi was a mere school theologian; but a friend of his, a young ecclesiastic, now made him aware that there were sources of knowledge beyond the scholastic sphere, more extensive, more interesting, and more real, than those to which he had hitherto applied. Genovesi entered into this new intellectual world by the perusal of some romances; from these he proceeded to the study of history; and, stepping from one subject to another, he finally applied himself to the study of modern philosophy, and read with attention the works of Leibnitz and Locke. In the hope of acquiring still further information, he repaired to the capital; and as he did not possess the necessary means of maintaining himself there, he resolved to exercise the profession of advocate; but having become disgusted with the details of practice, he soon sacrificed his hopes of fortune to the pleasures of study. He improved his knowledge of the Greek, and of several of the modern languages, attended all the most celebrated professors of the university of Naples, and soon perceived the imperfections of the existing system of public instruction.\n",
      "Notwithstanding the progress which philosophy had made in other countries, the kingdom of Naples was, at that period, in a state almost retrograde, or at least stationary. Genovesi felt this, and he resolved to accomplish certain reforms in the system of education, with a view to the amelioration of the condition of his countrymen. None ever succeeded better in this generous design. Although.there existed at Naples a university celebrated for the learning of several of its professors, the pupils had long been accustomed to carry on their studies in private schools. Genovesi having conceived the design of opening one of these seminaries, he procured the appointment of extraordinary professor of metaphysics in the university, in order that he might appear before the public in a known character. He had formed peculiar methods of his own in all the faculties which constitute the philosophical course; and his first essays induced him to publish his Elements of Metaphysics, of which the first volume appeared in 1743, and afterwards, in 1745, his System of Logic.'\n",
      "In these two works he made ample use of the doctrines of Bacon, Descartes, Leibnitz, and Locke; and having substituted philosophical doubt for implicit belief, the observation of nature for the speculations of the schools, and reason for authority, this was sufficient to cause him to be denounced as an infidel, or at least as an irreligious person, by those who still adhered to the scholastic methods. He would probably have fallen a sacrifice to these prejudices, had he not been supported by Galiani, archbishop of Tarentum, grand almoner of the king, and grand master of the university; but notwithstanding this protection, he experienced some trouble and difficulty in obtaining the professorship of moral philosophy: and he was disappointed in an attempt to procure the chair of theology.\n",
      "The unjust and obstinate hostility which he suffered on account of his theological works diverted him, for some time, from this dangerous path of inquiry, and brought him back to that of philosophy. He published a continuation of his Elements of Metaphysics, but, with every new volume, he continued to experience the censures and opposition of the partisans of the scholastic routine. Amongst these were the Cardinal Spinelli, archbishop of Naples, and an Abbé Magli, whom Genovesi covered with ridicule, in his work entitled Lettere a un Amico Provinciale In spite of these continual jarrings, Genovesi obtained the approbation and esteem of Pope Benedict XIV., of several cardinals, and of most of the learned men who at that period flourished in Italy. Of this number was Intieri, a Florentine, who having spent a long time at Naples, became much attached to that country. This man, as distinguished for his philanthropical qualities as for the extent and solidity of his acquirements, was still more estimable on account of the use which he made of his fortune. It is to him that Italy is indebted for her first chair of political economy; he founded it, at his own expense, with the sanction of government, in the university of Naples, under three conditions, namely, that the lectures should be given in Italian, that Genovesi should be the first professor, and that, after his death, no ecclesiastic should succeed him.\n",
      "Genovesi opened his first course of lectures on the 5th of November 1754, with great success. The novelty and the interest of the subject, the eloquent style and agreeable manner of the professor, attracted a crowd of auditors, and made a deep and lively impression. Nothing, indeed, was talked of but agriculture and commerce. To gratify the taste of the public for these new inquiries, he afterwards published his Lectures on Commerce, and Carey’s Account of the Trade of England, translated into Italian by his brother, and enriched with notes by himself. His Lectures on Commerce was indisputably the most interesting work he had hitherto published. There are some errors, indeed, in his method, and even in his doctrines; but the work contains many important truths relative to every department of public administration, and a good application of analysis to subjects which had not hitherto been sufficiently investigated. Finally, it had the merit of being the first work which introduced into Italy, and particularly into the kingdom of Naples, a taste for the study of political economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great success of these lectures, which were deli-livered in Italian, induced Genovesi to draw up a complete code of philosophy in that language. It was at this time the custom in Italy, and particularly at Naples, to teach every thing in Latin; a practice which prevented knowledge from spreading among those classes to whom that language was not familiar; and the Neapolitans, at that period, wanted education perhaps more than any other people. He had published, in Italian, his Meditationi Filosofiche, on religion and morals; and his Lettere Accademiche, on the utility of the arts and sciences; a treatise written in opposition to the well-known work of Rousseau on that subject. Following out his plan, he began to recast all his Latin works, to improve their form, and to give them a more interesting character. The first which he published was his treatise on Logic; a work which went through several editions. He afterwards published his Metaphysics, divided into three parts; the first containing an essay on cosmology, the second on theology, and the third on anthropology. In 1767, he published part of a work on the Science of the Rights and Duties of Man ; but this work was never completed. In all his writings, and particularly in his Meditations and Letters, the style is somewhat affected; at the same time they present us with a good exposition of the ideas and systems of the most celebrated philosophers.\n",
      "After the suppression of the order of the Jesuits, when it became a question with the government whether they ought to be reinstated in their superintendence of public instruction, Genovesi was consulted, and his advice was, to replace the scholastic chairs by schools of mathematics, physics, and history; and he proposed one chair for the illustration of Cicero’s Offices.\n",
      "From the commencement of the year 1763, Genovesi had felt the symptoms of a dangerous malady; but he continued to teach and to write to the last day of his life; and before his death he had the satisfaction of witnessing the great success of his labours. Since the days of Te-lesius and Campanella, no school had attained more credit and celebrity at Naples than that of Genovesi. Pupils, some of them men of the most illustrious rank, flocked to his lectures; and those who heard him generally adopted his ideas and followed his maxims. He handled the most abstruse subjects in the most agreeable manner, and in a style almost poetical; a circumstance which gave him a great command over the attention, as well as over the judgment, of his pupils. Indeed all that Italy has since produced in philosophical and economical science may be said to have originated in the school which he founded. He died of an attack of dropsy, on the 22d of September 1769, aged about fifty-seven.\n",

      "a distinguished critic, satirist, and dramatic annotator, was born at Ashburton, in Devonshire, in April 1757. Although his immediate ancestors possessed considerable property in their native county, and were there accounted gentlemen, yet a series of indiscretions had deprived them of tlιe greater part of their substance; and when the subject of this memoir was born, his father only possessed two small estates. The elder Gifford, whose roving propensities had driven him to sea, and also led him “to wander in some vagabond society,” as his son informs us, established himself after his marriage, as a plumber and glazier, at South Molton. But his habits were unsettled and desultory; he went again to sea, and once more returned without having acquired any wisdom from his misfortunes; and he died at last, “of a decayed and ruined constitution, before he was forty.” When this event happened, his son William had not completed his thirteenth year. He had been sent to school to read, write, and cipher; but, according to his own account of himself, he there made “a most wretched progress.” In less than twelve months after the death of his father, his mother followed her husband to the grave, and after various vicissitudes young Gifford was sent on board of a coasting vessel, by the person under whose guardianship he had been placed. This individual, who was his godfather, and into whose hands the effects of Gifford’s parents had fallen, recalled him from his nautical pursuits, principally, it would appear, on account of the outcry which the people of Ashburton raised against him for the manner in which he had treated his young charge. Gifford was now sent to school, where he made great progress, especially in arithmetic; but from this he was in a short time withdrawn, and apprenticed to a shoemaker. He was now in his fifteenth year, and he was articled to serve until he was twenty-one. But he thoroughly listed his new profession, and whenever leisure afforded him opportunities, he prosecuted his favourite Study of mathematics. Few facilities for study fell to his lot, but his ingenuity supplied the deficiency; and the means which he adopted of improving himself as well as the irrepressible perseverance which he displayed, affords a striking instance of the force of genius in compensating and overcoming the disadvantages of untoward circumstances. He also began to write verses, though not at this Įieriod for amusement, but only when he wanted money for his mathematical pursuits. But his devotedness to his studies seems to have rendered him indifferent to the concerns of his master, whose indignation was accordingly roused. He requested young Gifford to give up his books and papers; and this being refused, he proceeded to the garret of the delinquent, which he thoroughly sacked. Being now deprived of his sole means of improvement, almost of enjoyment, Gifford began to display a degree of sullenness, reserve, and discontent, which made him an object of dislike to his fellow-workmen. However, in this humble and obscure condition, poor beyond the common lot, he attracted the notice of Mr Cookesley, a surgeon of the town in which he resided. This excellent individual deeply interested himself in behalf of Gifford, and set on foot a subscription to purchase his freedom from the latter part of his indentures, and to pay for his education; a scheme which completely succeeded. Thus, by an act of generosity, which it is pleasing to record, was the humble shoemaker rescued from his abject state, and placed in circumstances which enabled him to gain the highest literary honours, and to sit in judgment upon the most gifted men of his time.\n",
      "After having passed two years at school, he was pronounced fit for the university; and by the active benevolence of Mr Cookesley he was enabled to proceed to Oxford, where he obtained the situation of Bible reader in Exeter College. Whilst at this place, he undertook a translation of Juvenal, poetry having now become his delight. A subscription for publishing it was set on foot; but during the progress of this undertaking his benefactor died; a circumstance which ultimately, and perhaps fortunately, prevented him from publishing a translation of the great Roman satirist, at least for a time. By an accidental occurrence, however, he became known to Lord Grosvenor, who invited him to his house. He accordingly quitted Oxford, and took up his residence with that nobleman, under whose hospitable roof he prosecuted the translation of Juvenal, until called upon to accompany the son of his patron to the Continent. With this young nobleman he spent, in two successive tows, many years, “of which,” he says in his autobiography, “the remembrance will always be dear.” Although Mr Gifford was principally engaged upon his translation of Juvenal, its publication was preceded by several other productions, by which at the time he obtained great popularity. The first was the Bavaid, a paraphrase on the first satire of Persius. This production appeared in 1794, and was levelled at a class of poetasters who deluged the daily prints of the time with their weak and effeminate lucubrations, which were likewise deformed by the most fulsome adulation of each other. The satire had the effect of completely extinguishing this tuneless tribe. Mr Gifford’s next production, which appeared the following year, was entitled the Maviad ; an imitation of Horace, and directed against the corruptions of the drama. This work was only partially successful, for the malady which it was intended to cure had its seat in public manners rather than in the affectation of individuals. In both of these works Mr Gifford displays the most caustic severity and personality; and it has been questioned whether the harmless generation of ephemeral songsters and dramatists deserved the abuse with which they were assailed. In 1800 he published his Epistle to Peter Pindar, an attack which brought him little else but disquietude; the laughter of the one satirist being quite as formidable as the gall of the other. About this period Mr Gifford became connected with a set of men of wit and genius, at the head of whom was Mr Canning, who resolved upon establishing a weekly paper for the purpose of exposing to ridicule the political agitators of the time. This print was called the Anti-Jacobin, and Mr Gifford became its editor. The ministerial connection thus formed was of some use to him, as by it he obtained tl>e paymastership of the band of gentlemen pensioners; and at a subsequent period he was made a double commissioner of the lottery. In 1802 appeared his English version of Juvenal, a work which may be said to have engrossed the greater part of his life. It was ushered into the world with every possible advantage, headed by a dedication to Earl Grosvenor, and with the translator’s autobiography prefixed to it. The translation is able and spirited, although it is occasionally diβiιse and unharmonious, and not unfrequently coarse in its diction. In 1805 Mr Gifford published an edition of the Plays of Massinger in four volumes; and in 1816 the Works of Ben Johnson, in nine volumes. In his annotations upon both these dramatic poets he displays great acuteness and industry; but in exposing the blunders of previous commentators, he shows not a little of his characteristic acerbity. In 1821 he published a version of Persius; and since his death his editions of the dramatic works of Ford and Shirley have been given to the world, accompanied with able and acute notes.\n",
      "It was, however, as editor of the Quarterly Review that Mr Gifford became most generally known. The success of the Edinburgh Review, in advocating liberal principles in politics, suggested to the opposite party the idea of a counterpoise in the shape of the journal above named, which was accordingly carried into effect in 1809, and Mr Gifford entrusted with its management. The scheme completely succeeded; and it is allowed by all parties, that as editor of this distinguished journal, Mr Gifford displayed uncommon skill and ability. No man possessed a finer tact in discerning the weak and bad points of an author, when his object was to turn him into ridicule; none could hold them up to laughter with more felicitous acrimony. From the time of his taking the charge of the Quarterly Review until his death, few circumstances of any moment occurred in the life of Mr Gifford, except the publication of the works already mentioned. He continued the editorship until about two years before his death, which took place on the 31st of December 1826.\n",
      "From the prominent position which Mr Gilford occupied in the literary world, his character has been the subject of severe animadversion by one party, and of exaggerated eulogy by another. Of his great talents there can be no doubt. His sagacity and quickness of apprehension were striking, and the rapidity with which he acquired knowledge is proved by his having prepared himself for the university after being only two years at school. His wit was distinguished for caustic severity rather than for brilliancy, and he dealt more in invective than in polished repartee. As a poet he cannot be said to rank very high; but that he had a keen perception of the beauties of the noblest inspirations of the muse, and could point them out with great felicity, provided political feelings did not intervene to pervert his judgment, is proved by his many admirable criticisms, and by the confidence which Lord Byron and others reposed in his opinions. In private life Mr Gifford was modest and unassuming; and amongst the numerous parties, poetical, political, or religious, who occasionally suffered by his castigations, none of them ever ventured to recriminate by attacking the moral character of the editor of the Quarterly Review. The memoir of himself, which he prefixed to his version of Juvenal, is one of the most remarkable pieces of autobiography extant. It is written with ability and m\n",

      "rector of Houghton, distinguished by his extraordinary piety and hospitality, was descended from an ancient and honourable family in Westmoreland, and born in 1517. As he was bred in the Catholic religion, so he for some time defended it against the reformers, and at Oxford held a disputation with Hooper, afterwards bishop of Worcester, and a martyr for the Protestant faith; but he was staggered in another disputation with Peter Martyr, and began seriously to examine the contested points by the best authorities. Accordingly, being presented to the vicarage of Norton, in the diocese of Durham, he soon resigned it, and went abroad to consult eminent professors on both sides; and after three years absence returned, a little before the death of Queen Mary, satisfied with the general doctrines of the Reformation. He was kindly received by his uncle Dr Tonstall, bishop of Durham, who soon afterwards gave him the archdeaconry of Durham, to which the rectory of Ellington was annexed. When repairing to his parish, though the persecution was then at its height, he boldly preached against the vices, errors, and corruptions of the times, especially among the clergy, on which a charge, consisting of thirteen articles, was drawn up against him, and presented in form to the bishop. But Dr Tonstall found a method of dismissing the cause in such a manner as to protect his nephew without endangering himself, and soon afterwards presented him to the rich living of Houghton-le-Spring. He was a second time accused to the bishop, and again protected; when his enemies, enraged at this second defeat, laid their complaint before Dr Bonner, bishop of London, who immediately gave orders to apprehend him. Upon this Mr Gilpin prepared for martyrdom; and having ordered his house-steward to provide him a long garment, that he might make a decent appearance at the stake, he set out for London. Luckily, however, he broke his leg on the journey, which protracted his arrival until the news of the queen’s death freed him from all further apprehension. Being immediately set at liberty, he returned to Houghton, where he was received by his parishioners with the most sincere joy.\n",
      "Upon the deprivation of the Roman Catholic bishops, he was offered the see of Carlisle, which he declined; and confining his attention to his rectory, he discharged all the duties of his function in the most exemplary manner. To the greatest humanity and courtesy, he added an unwearied application to the instruction of those under his care. He was not satisfied with the advice he gave in public, but used to instruct in private, and brought his parishioners to come to him with their doubts and difficulties. He had a most engaging manner towards those whom he thought well disposed; nay, his very reproof was so conducted that it seldom gave offence; the becoming gentleness with which it was urged made it always appear as the effect of friendship. Thus, with unceasing assiduity, he employed himself in admonishing the vicious and engaging the well-intentioned; and by these means he in a few years effected a greater change in his neighbourhood than could well have been imagined.\n",
      "But his hopes were not so much in the existing generation as in the succeeding one. It was an easier task, he found, to prevent vice than to correct it; to form the young to virtue, than to amend the bad habits of the old. He employed much of his time, therefore, in endeavouring to improve the minds of the younger part of his parish, suffering none to grow up in ignorance of their duty, but pressing it as the wisest part to unite religion with labour, and, amidst the cares of this life, to have a constant eye upon the next. He attended to every thing which might be of service to his parishioners. He was assiduous in preventing lawsuits among them. His hall iβ said to have been often thronged with people, who came to him about their differences. He was not indeed much acquainted with law, but he could decide equitably, and that satisfied them; nor could his sovereign's commission have given him greater weight or authority than his own character secured him.\n",
      "His hospitable manner of living was the admiration of the whole country. He spent in his family every fortnight forty bushels of com, twenty bushels of malt, and a whole ox; besides a proportional quantity of other kinds of provision. Strangers and travellers found a cheerful reception. All were welcome who came; and even their beasts had so much care taken of them, that it was humorously said, if a horse were turned loose in any part of the country, it would immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton.\n",
      "Every Sunday, from Michaelmas till Easter, was a sort of public day with him. During this season he expected to see all his parishioners and their families. For their reception, he had three tables well covered; the first being intended for gentlemen, the second for husbandmen and farmers, and the third for day-labourers. This piece of hospitality he never omitted, even when losses, or a scarcity of provision, made its continuance rather difficult to him. He thought it his duty, and that was a decisive motive. Even when he was absent from home, no alteration was made in his expenses; the poor were fed as usual, and his neighbours entertained.\n",
      "But notwithstanding all his painful industry, and the large scope he had for it in so extensive a parish, Mr Gilpin thought the sphere of his benevolence too confined. It grieved him extremely to see everywhere, in the parishes around him, so great a degree of ignorance and superstition, occasioned by the shameful neglect of the pastoral cure among the clergy of those parts. The bad consequences resulting from this induced him to supply, as far as he could, what was wanting in others. For this purpose, he used every year regularly to visit the most neglected parishes in Northumberland, Yorkshire, Cheshire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland; and that his own parish might not in the mean time suffer, he was at the expense of a constant assistant. In each place he staid two or three days; and his method was, to call the people about him, and lay before them, in as plain a way as possible, the danger of leading wicked or even careless lives; explaining to them the nature of true religion, instructing them in the duties they owed to God, their neighbour, and themselves, and showing them how greatly a moral and religious conduct would contribute to their present as well as future happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Gilpin’s generous and hospitable manner of living has been already noticed. The value of his rectory was about L.400 a year; an income, indeed, at that time very considerable, but yet in appearance very disproportionate to the generous things he performed with it; indeed he could not have done these, unless his frugality had been equal to his generosity. His friends, therefore, could not but wonder to find him, amidst his many great and continual expenses, entertain the design of building and endowing a grammar-school; a design, however, which his exact economy soon enabled him to accomplish, though the expense of it amounted to upwards of L.500. His school was no sooner opened than it began to flourish; and so great a number of young people flocked to it, that in a little time the town was not able to accommodate them. He put himself, therefore, to the inconvenience of fitting up, for that purpose, a part of his own house, where he seldom had fewer than twenty or thirty children. Some of these were the sons of persons of distinction, whom he boarded at easy rates; but the greater part were poor children, whom he educated, clothed, and maintained at his own charge. He was at the expense likewise of boarding in the town many other poor children. He used to bring several every year from the different parts where he preached, particularly from Readsdale and Tinedale; places which he was at great pains in civilizing, and in rooting out that barbarism which every year prevailed less and less amongst them.\n",
      "As to his school, he not only placed in it able masters, whom he procured from Oxford, but he himself likewise constantly inspected it; and, that encouragement might quicken the application of his boys, he always took particular notice of the most promising. He would call them ∕us own ιcholars, and would send for them often to his apartment, and there instruct them himself. One method used by him to fill his school was a little singular. Whenever he met a poor boy upon the road, he would make trial of his capacity by a few questions, and if he found it such as pleased him, he would provide for his education. And besides those whom he sent from his own school to the universities, and there wholly maintained, he likewise gave to others, who were in circumstances to do something for themselves, what further assistance they required. By these means he induced many parents to allow their children a liberal education, who would not otherwise have done so. Nor did Mr Gilpin think it sufficient to afford the means only of an academical education to these young people; he endeavoured also to render it as beneficial to them as he could. He still considered himself as their proper guardian; and he seemed to think himself bound to the public for their being made useful members of society, as far as it lay in his power to make them so. With this view he carried on a punctual correspondence with their tutors; and made the youths themselves frequently write to him, and give him an account of their studies. So solicitous indeed was he about them, knowing the many temptations to which their age and situation naturally exposed them, that once every other year he generally made a journey to the universities to inspect their behaviour. Nor was this uncommon care unrewarded; for many of his scholars became ornaments to the church, and men of exemplary piety.\n",

      "in Antiquity, persons who fought chiefly in the arena of the amphitheatre at Rome, for the entertainment of the people. The gladiators were generally slaves, and fought from necessity 5 though sometimes freemen took to the same profession, like our prize-fighters, for a livelihood. Γhe Romans borrowed this cruel diversion from the Asiatics; and some suppose that there was policy m the practice, the frequent combats of gladiators Unding to accustom the people to despise danger and\n",
      "The origin of these combats seems obvious. From the earliest times it had been the custom to sacrifice captives, or prisoners of war, to the manes of the great men who had died in battle. Thus Achilles, in the Iliad, (lib. xxiii.), sacrificed twelve young Trojans to the manes of Patroclus; and in Virgil (lib. xi. ver. 81), AEneas sent captives to Evander to be sacrificed at the funeral of his son Pallas. But in process of time they came also to sacrifice slaves at the funerals of all persons of condition; and this was even esteemed a necessary part of the ceremony; butas it would have appeared barbarous to massacre them like beasts, they were appointed to fight with each other, and to endeavour to save their own lives by killing their adversary. This seemed somewhat less inhuman, because there was a possibility of avoiding death, by an exertion of skill and courage. The profession of gladiator thus became an art; and hence arose masters of the art, men learned in fighting and exercise. These masters, whom the Latins called lanistoe, bought slaves to be trained up to this cruel trade, and afterwards sold them to such as had occasion to present the people with so horrible a show.\n",
      "The exhibitions were at first performed near the sepulchre of the deceased, or around the funeral pile; but they were afterwards removed to the circus and amphitheatres, and became ordinary amusements. The first show of gladiators, called munus gladiatorium, was, according to Valerius Maximus, exhibited at Rome by Marcus and Decius Brutus, upon the death of their father, in the year of the city 490. On this occasion there were probably only three pairs of gladiators. In 537 the three sons of Μ. AEmilius Lepidus the augur, who had been thrice consul, entertained the people with the cruel pleasure of seeing twenty-two gladiators fight in the forum. In 547, the first Africanus diverted his army at New Carthage (Carthagena), with a show of gladiators, which ħς exhibited in honour of his father and uncle, who had begun the reduction of Spain. In process of time the Romans became so fond of these bloody entertainments, that not only the heir of any great and rich citizen lately deceased, but all the principal magistrates, presented the people with shows of this nature, to procure their favour. The aediles, praetors, consuls, and, above all, the candidates for offices, made their court to the people by entertaining them frequently with these fights; and even the priests were sometimes exhibitors of these barbarous shows; for we meet with the ludi pontificales in Suetonius (August, cap. 44), and with the ludi sacerdotales, in Pliny (Ľpist. lib. vii.). As for the emperors, it was so much their interest to ingratiate themselves with the populace, that they obliged them with combats of gladiators upon almost all occasions; and as these multiplied, the number of combatants likewise increased. Accordingly, Julius Caesar, in his aedileship, diverted the people with the exhibition of three hundred and twenty couples. Titus exhibited a show of gladiators, wild beasts, and representations of sea-fights, which lasted a hundred days; and Trajan continued a solemnity of this nature for a hundred and twenty-three days, during which time he brought out a thousand pairs of gladiators. Before this time, and under the republic, the number of gladiators was so great, that when the conspiracy of Catiline broke out, the senate ordered them to be dispersed into the garrisons and secured, lest they should join the disaffected party.\n",
      "These sports at length became so common, and their consequences in a variety of respects proved so dangerous, that Cicero caused a law to be enacted that no person should exhibit a show of gladiators within two years before he appeared as a candidate for any office. Julius Caesar gave orders that only a certain number of men of this profession should be in Rome at a time; Augustus decreed that only two shows of gladiators should be presented in a year, and never above sixty couples of combatants in a show; and Tiberius provided by an order of senate, that no person should have the privilege of gratifying the people with such a solemnity unless he was worth 500,000 sesterces. The same exhibitions were also regulated by Nerva. The Emperor Claudius restrained them to certain occasions; but he soon afterwards annulled what he had decreed; private persons began to exhibit them as usual, and some carried the brutal satisfaction so far as to have them at their ordinary feasts.\n",
      "The master of the gladiators made them all swear that they would fight to death; and, if they failed, they were put to death by fire, swords, clubs, whips, or the like. It was a crime for the wretches to complain when they were wounded, or to ask for death or seek to avoid it when overcome; but it was usual for the emperor or the people to grant them life when they exhibited no signs of fear, but waited the fatal stroke with courage and intrepidity. Augustus even decreed that life should always be granted them.\n",
      "From slaves and freemen the inhuman sport at length spread to people of rank and condition; so that Augustus was obliged to issue an edict providing that none of the senatorian order should become gladiators; and soon afterwards he imposed the same constraint on the knights. Nevertheless Nero is related to have brought upwards of four hundred senators and six hundred Roman knights upon the arena; though Lipsius supposes both these numbers to be falsified, and not without reason reduces them to forty senators and sixty knights. But Domitian refined on the practice of Nero, and exhibited combats of women in the night time.\n",
      "Constantine the Great is said to have first prohibited the combats of gladiators in the East; at least he forbade those who were condemned to death for their crimes being employed in these exhibitions; and there is still extant an order to the profectus proetorii, dated at Berytus in Phoenicia the 1st of October 325.\n",
      "The Emperor Honorius forbade them at Rome on occasion of the death of Telemachus, who coming from the East to Rome at the time of one of these spectacles, went down into the arena, and used all his endeavours to prevent the gladiators from continuing the sport; upon which the spectators of the carnage, fired with indignation, stoned him to death. It must be observed, however, that the practice was not entirely abolished in the West before the time of Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths. Honorius, on the occasion first mentioned, had prohibited them; but the prohibition does not seem to have been enforced. Theodoric, in the year 500, finally abolished them.\n",
      "Some time before the day of combat, the person who presented the people with these shows gave notice of his intention by programmes or bills, containing the names of the gladiators, and the marks by which they were to be distinguished; for each had his peculiar badge, which was commonly a peacock’s feather, as appears from the scholiast of Juvenal on the 158th verse of the third satire, and also from Turnebus (Advers. lib. ii. cap 8). They also gave notice how long the shows would last, and how many couples of gladiators were to exhibit; and it even appears, from the seventh satire of the second book of Horace, that they sometimes made representations of these things in painting, as is practised among us by those who have any thing to exhibit at fairs.\n",
      "The day being come, they began the entertainment by bringing two kinds of weapons; the first being staves or wooden foils, called rudes, and the second effective weapons, as swords, poniards, and the like. The first were called arma lusoria, or exercitoria ; the second decretoria, as being given by decree or sentence by the praetor, or by him at whose expense the spectacle was exhibited. They began to fence or skirmish with the first, which usually formed the prelude to the battle; and from these, when well warmed, they advanced to the second at the sound of the trumpets, with which they fought naked. Then they were said vertere arma. The terms of striking were petere et repetere ; of avoiding a blow, exire : and when one of the combatants received a remarkable wound, his adversary or the people cried out, Habet, or hoc habet. The first part of the engagement was called ventilare, proludere; and the second, dimicare ad certum, or versis armis pugnare ; and some authors think, with much probability, that it is to these two kinds of combat that St Paul alludes in the passage(1 Cor. ix. 26, 27) where he says, “Ifight not as one that beateth the air; but I keep my body, and bring it into subjection.”\n",
      "If the vanquished surrendered his arms, it was not in the victor’s power to grant him life; it was the people during the time of the republic, and the prince or people during the time of the empire, who were alone empowered to grant this boon. The reward of the conqueror was a branch of palm tree, and a sum of money, probably collected amongst the spectators; sometimes they gave him his congé, or dismissed him by putting one of the wooden foils or rudes in his hand; and sometimes they even granted him his freedom, putting the pilaeus on his head. The sign or indication by which the spectators showed that they granted the favour, was premere pollicem, which Μ. Dacier takes to be a clenching of the figures of both hands between one another, and so holding the two thumbs upright, close together; and, when they desired to have the combat finished and the vanquished slain, v\n",

      "the encrusting of earthen ware with a vitreous substance, the basis of which is lead.\n",
      "The workers of common earthen ware, however, are not at the trouble of thus previously making a pure glass of lead. Their usual composition for glazing ware is formed, of white sand forty pounds, of red lead twenty pounds, of pearl ashes twenty pounds, and of common salt twelve pounds. The sand is powdered by grinding, and then the other ingredients are added and ground together; after which they are calcined for some time with a moderate heat, and when the mixture is cold it is reduced to powder, and when wanted for use tempered with water. The proportion of these ingredients may be occasionally varied. The w are, after being turned on the wheel and dried in the open air, is covered over with the above composition by means of a brush; and when set in the furnace the violent heat soon reduces it to a perfect glass, covering the whole internal and external surface of the vessel.\n",
      "We may observe in general, however, that lead ought to be excluded from the composition of glazings, and other fluxes substituted in its stead. A transparent glazing may be prepared without lead, by calcining forty pounds of white sand, twenty-five pounds of pearl ashes, and fifteen pounds of common salt, and proceeding as before; and a more perfect transparent glazing may be made of sand forty pounds, of wood ashes perfectly burned fifty pounds, of pearl ashes ten pounds, and of common salt twelve pounds. The receipts annexed are taken for the most part from Kunckel, who says that they are the true glazings used at Delft, and in other Dutch manufactories.\n",
      "Black is made of red lead eight parts, iron filings three parts, copper ashes three parts, and zaffer two measures. This when melted makes a brown black; and if it be wanted blacker, more zaffer must be added to it.\n",

If it be desired to have it fine and good, put the mixture into a glass furnace for a day or two.\n",
      "Another blue glazing may be formed of one pound of tartar, a quarter of a pound of red lead, half an ounce of zaffer, and a quarter of a pound of powdered flints, which must be fused and managed as in the last receipt. Or, take two pounds of calcined lead and tin, add five pounds of common salt, fi ve pounds of powdered flints, and of zaf-ser, tartar, and Venetian glass, each one pound; calcine and fuse the mixture as before. Or, again, take of red lead one part, of sand three parts, and of zaffer one part. For a violet-blue glazing, take four ounces of tartar, two ounces of red lead, five ounces of powdered flints, and half a drachm of manganese.\n",
      "Brown is made of red lead and flints, of each fourteen parts, and of manganese two parts, fused; or of red lead twelve parts, and manganese one part, fused. A brown glazing, to be laid on a white ground, mav be made of manganese two parts, and of red lead and white glass one part of each, twice fused. Flesh-coloured is made of twelve parts of lead ashes, and one of white glass. To prepare the gold-coloured, take of litharge three parts, of sand or calcined flint one part; pound and mix these well together, then run them into a yellow glass with a strong fire. Pound this glass, and grind it into a subtile powder, which moisten with a well-saturated solution of silver; form it into a paste, then put it into a crucible, and cover it with a lid. Apply at first a gentle degree of fire; then increase, and continue it until a green glass has been obtained. Pound this glass again, and grind it to a fine powder; moisten the powder,with some beer, so that by means of a hair pencil you may apply it upon the vessels or any piece of earthen ware. The vessels which are painted or covered over with this glazing must first be well heated, then put under a muffle; and as soon as the glass runs, they must be smoked, by holding them over burning vegetables, and then taken out. Heinsius of St Petersburg, who sent this receipt to the Royal Society, uses the words afflare debes fumum, which is rendered “smoke them,” in the transactions. (Phil. Trans. No. 465, sect. 6.)\n",
      "Kunckel gives several preparations for a gold-coloured yellow glazing. This may be produced by fusing a mixture of three parts of red lead, two parts of antimony, and one part of saffron of Mars; by again melting the powdered mass, and repeating the operation four times; or by fusing four or five times a composition of red lead and antimony of each an ounce, and of scales of iron half an ounce; or by calcining and fusing together eight parts of red lead, six parts of flints, one part of yellow ochre, one part of antimony, and one part of white glass. A transparent gold-coloured glazing may be obtained by twice fusing red lead and white flints, of each twelve parts, and of filings of iron one part.\n",
      "Green may be prepared from eight parts of litharge or red lead, eight parts of Venice glass, and four parts of brass dust or filings of copper; or from ten parts of litharge, twelve of flint or pebble, and one of as ustum or copper ashes. A fine green glazing may also be produced by fusing one part of the Bohemian granate, one part of filings of copper, one part of red lead, and one part of Venetian glass; or by fusing one part of white glass, and the same quantity of red lead, and of filings of copper, powdering the mass, and adding one part of Bohemian granate to two parts of this powder. A fine green may likewise be obtained by mixing and grinding together any of the yellow glazings with equal quantities of the blue glazings; and all the shades and teints of green will be obtained by varying the proportion of the one to the other, and by the choice of the kind of yellow and blue.\n",
      "Sea-green is made of five pounds of lead ashes, one pound of tin ashes, three pounds of flint, three quarters of a pound of salt, half a pound of tartar, and half a pound of copper dust. Iron colour is prepared from fifteen parts of lead ashes or red lead, fifteen of white sand or flints, and five of calcined copper. This mixture must be calcined and fused. Liver colour is prepared from twelve parts of litharge, eight of salt, six of pebble or flint, and one of manganese. Purple brown consists of lead ashes fifteen parts, clean sand or powdered flints eighteen parts, manganese one part, and white glass fifteen measures, to which some add one measure of zaffer. Red is made of antimony three pounds, litharge or red lead three, and rust of iron one, which are ground to a fine powder; or take two pounds of antimony, three of red lead, and one of calcined saffron of Mars, and proceed as before.\n",
      "The white glazing for common ware is made of forty pounds of clear sand, seventy-five pounds of litharge or lead ashes, twenty-six of potashes, and ten pounds of salt; and these are thrice melted into a cake, quenching it each time in clear cold water. Jθr it may be made of fifty pounds of clean sand, seventy of lead ashes, thirty of wood ashes, and twelve of salt. For a fine white, take two pounds of lead and one of tin; calcine them to ashes; of this take two parts, calcined flint, white sand, or broken white glass, one part, and salt one part; mix them well together and melt them into a cake for use. The trouble of calcining the tin and lead may be prevented by procuring them in a proper state. A very fine white glazing may be obtained by calcining two parts of lead and one part of tin; and taking one part of this mass, and of flints and common salt one part each, and fusing the mixture. A white glazing may also be prepared by mixing a hundred pounds of masticot, sixty pounds of red lead, twenty pounds of calcined tin or putty, and ten pounds of common salt, and calcining and powdering the mixture several times.\n",
      "Yellow is prepared of red lead three pounds, calcined antimony and tin two pounds of each; or, according to some, of equal quantities of the three ingredients. These must be melted into a cake, then ground to a fine powder, and this operation must be repeated several times; or it may be made of fifteen parts of lead ore, three parts of litharge of silver, and fifteen parts of sand. A fine yellow glazing may be procured by mixing five parte of red lead, two parte of powdered brick, one part of sand, one part of the white glazings, and two parts of antimony, calcining the mixture and then fusing it. Or take four parts of white glass, one part of antimony, three parts of red lead, and one part of iron scales, and fuse the mixture; or fuse sixteen parts of flints, one part of iron filings, and twenty-four parte of litharge. A light-yellow glazing may be produced with ten parte of red lead, three parte of antimony and three of glass, and two parte of calcined tin. A citronyellow is made of six parts of red lead, seven parte of fine red brick dust, and two parts of antimony. This mixture must be calcined day and night for the space of four days, in the ash-hole of a glass-house furnace, and at last urged to fusion.\n",
      "The Romans had a method of glazing their earthen vessels, which in many respects appears to have been superior to ours. The common brown glazing easily scales off, cracks, and in a short time becomes disagreeable to the eye; besides, it is very easily destroyed by acids, nor can vessels glazed in this manner be even employed to hold water, without part of it oozing through their pores. Lead is also very destructive to the human body; and if acids are unwarily put into vessels glazed with lead, the liquors will receive a dangerous impregnation from the metal. The Roman glazing, which is still to be seen upon urns excavated in several places, appears to have been made of some kind of varnish; and Pliny gives us a hint that it was mad\n",

      "von, a man of commanding influence in the literature of modern Germany throughout the latter half of his long life, and possessing two separate claims upon our notice; one in right of his own unquestionable talents; and another much stronger, though less direct, arising out of his position, and the extravagant partisanship put forward on his behalf for the last forty years. The literary body in all countries, and for reasons which rest upon a sounder basis than that of private jealousies, have always been disposed to a republican simplicity in all that regards the assumption of rank and personal pretensions. Valeat quantum valere potest, is the form of license to every man's ambition, coupled with its caution: let his influence and authority be commensurate with his attested value: and, because no man in the present infinity of human speculation, and the present multiformity of human power, can hope for more than a very limited superiority, there is an end at oncfe to all absolute dictatorship. 1 i he dictatorship in any case could be only relative, and in relation to a single department of art or knowledge; and this for a reason stronger even than that already noticed, viz. the vast extent of the field on which the intellect is now summoned to employ itself. That objection, as it applies only to the degree of the difficulty, might be met by a corresponding degree of mental energy; such a thing may be supposed, at least. But another difficul ty there is, of a profounder character, which cannot be so easily parried: those who have reflected at all upon the fine arts, know that power of one kind is often inconsistent, positively incompatible, with power of another kind. For example, the dramatic mind is incompatible with the epic. And though we should consent to suppose that some intellect might arise endowed upon a scale of such angelic comprehensiveness as to vibrate equally and indifferently towards either pole, still it is next to impossible, in the exercise and culture of the two powers, but some bias must arise which would give that advantage to the one over the other which the right arm has over the left. But the supposition, the very case put, is baseless, and countenanced∙by no precedent. Yet, under this previous difficulty, and with regard to a literature convulsed, if any ever was, by an almost total anarchy, it is a fact notorious to all who take an interest in Germany and its concerns, that Goethe did in one way or other, through the length and breadth of that vast country, establish a supremacy of influence wholly unexampled; a supremacy indeed perilous in a less honourable man, to those whom he might chance to hate, and with regard to himself thus far unfortunate, that it conferred upon every work proceeding from his pen a sort of papal indulgence, an immunity from criticism, or even from the appeals of good sense, such as it is not wholesome that any man should enjoy. Yet we repeat that German literature was and is in a condition of total anarchy: with this solitary exception, no name, even in the most narrow section of knowledge or of power, has ever been able in that country to challenge unconditional reverence; whereas, with us and in France, name the science, name the art, and we will name the dominant professor; a difference which partly arises out of the fact that England and France are governed in their opinions by two or three capital cities, whilst Germany looks for its leadership to as many cities as there are residenzen and universities: for instance, the little territory with which Goethe was connected presented no less than two such public lights; Weimar, the restdem or privileged abode of the Grand Duke, and Jena, the university founded by that house. Partly, however, this difference may be due to the greater restlessness, and to the greater energy as respects mere speculation, of the German mind. But no matter whence arising, or how interpreted, the fact is what we have described: ab-Sblute confusion, the “anarch old” of Milton, is the one deity whose sceptre is there paramount; and yet there it was, in that very realm of chaos, that Goethe built his throne. That he must have looked with trepidation and perplexity upon his wild empire and its ’ * dark foundations,” may be supposed. The tenure was uncertain to him as regarded its duration; to us it is equally uncertain, and in fact mysterious, as regards its origin. Meantime the mere fact, contrasted with the general tendencies of the German literary world, is sufficient to justify a notice, somewhat circumstantial, of the man in whose favour, whether naturally by force of genius, or by accident concurring with intrigue, so unexampled a result was effected.\n",
      "Goethe was born at noonday on the 28th of August 1749, in his father’s house at Frankfort on the Maine. The circumstances of his birth were thus far remarkable, that, unless Goethe’s vanity deceived him, they led to a happy revolution hitherto retarded by female delicacy falsely directed. From some error of the midwife who attended his mother, the infant Goethe appeared to be still born. Sons there were as yet none from this marriage; everybody was therefore interested in the child's lite and the panic which arose in consequence, having survived its immediate occasion, was improved into a public resolution (for which no doubt society stood ready at that moment) to found some course of public instruction from this time forward for those who undertook professionally the critical duties of accoucheur.\n",
      "We have noticed the house in which Goethe was born, as well as the city. Both were remarkable, and fitted to leave lasting impressions upon a young person of sensibility. As to the city, its antiquity is not merely venerable, but almost mysterious; towers were at that time to be found in the mouldering lines of its earliest defences, which belonged to the age of Charlemagne, or one still earlier; battlements adapted to a mode of warfare anterior even to that of feudalism or romance. The customs, usages, and local privileges of Frankfort, and the rural districts adjacent, were of a corresponding character. Festivals were annually celebrated at a short distance from the walls, which had descended from a dateless antiquity. Every thing which met the eye spoke the language of elder ages; whilst the river on which the place was seated, its great fair, which still held the rank of the greatest in Christendom, and its connection with the throne of Caesar and his inauguration, by giving to Frankfort an interest and a public character in the eyes of all Germany, had the effect of countersigning, as it were, by state authority, the importance which she otherwise challenged to her ancestral distinctions. Fit house for such a city, and in due keeping with the general scenery, was that of Goethe’s father. It had in fact been composed out of two contiguous houses; that accident had made it spacious and rambling in its plan; whilst a further irregularity had grown out of the original difference in point of level between the corresponding stories of the two houses, making it necessary to connect the rooms of the same suite by short flights of steps. Some of these features were no doubt removed by the recast of the house under the name of “repairs” (to evade a city bye-law), afterwards executed by his father; but such was the house of Goethe’s infancy, and in all other circumstances of style and furnishing equally antique.\n",
      "The spirit of society in Frankfort, without a court, a university, or a learned body of any extent, or a resident nobility in its neighbourhood, could not be expected to display any very high standard of polish. Yet, on the other hand, as an independent city, governed by its own separate laws and tribunals (that privilege of autonomy so dearly valued by ancient Greece) and possessing besides a resident corps of jurisprudents and of agents in various ranks for managing the interests of the German emperor and other princes, Frankfort had the means within herself of giving a liberal tone to the pursuits of her superior ci-tiaens, and of co-operating in no inconsiderable degree with the general movement of the times, political or intellectual. The memoirs of Goethe himself, and in particular the picture there given of his own family, as well as other contemporary glimpses of German domestic society in those days, are sufficient to show that much knowledge, much true cultivation of mind, much sound refinement of taste, were then distributed through the middle classes of German society; meaning by that very indeterminate expression those classes which for Frankfort composed the aristocracy, viz. all who had daily leisure, and regular funds for employing it to advantage. It is not necessary tα add, because that is a fact applicable to all stages of society, that Frankfort presented many and various specimens of original talent, moving upon all directions of human speculation.\n",
      "Yet, with this general allowance made for the capacities of the place, it is too evident that, for the most part, they lay inert and undeveloped. In many respects Frankfort resembled an English cathedral city, according to the standard of such places seventy years ago, not, that is to say, like Carlisle in this day, where a considerable manufacture exists, but like Chester as it is yet. The chapter of a cathedral, the resident ecclesiastics attached to the duties of so large an establishment, men always well educated, and generally having families, compose the original nucleus, around which soon gathers all that part of the 4ocal gentry who, for any purpose, whether of education for their children, or of social enjoyment for themselves, seek the advantages of a town. Hither resort all the timid old ladies who wish for conversation, or other forms of social amusement; hither resort the valetudinarians, male or female, by way of commanding superior medical advice at a cost not absolutely ruinous to themselves; and multi\n",

      "an eminent English poet and general writer, was born on the 29th of November 1728, at a place called Pallas, in the parish of Forney and county of Longford, in Ireland. His father, the Reverend Charles Goldsmith, was a clergyman of the established church, who had been educated at Dublin, and afterwards held the living of Kilkenny West, in the county of Westmeath. By his wife, Anne, daughter of the Reverend Mr Jones, master of the diocesan school of Elphin, he had five sons and two daughters. His eldest son Henry entered the church, and to him the Traveller is dedicated; the second was Oli- ver, who is supposed to have faithfully represented his father in the character of the village preacher in the poem of the Deserted Village. Oliver was originally intended for some mercantile employment, and with this view he was instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, at a common school; but, as he had shown an early predilection for poetry, and betrayed some inequalities of temper and conduct which seemed to indicate a disposition more favourable to the pursuits of genius than the regularity of business, he was put to a school of reputation to qualify him for entering the university with the advantage of suitable preparation. In June 1744, being then in his fifteenth year, he was entered as a sizer at Trinity College, Dublin; and in this seminary he continued a few years, when he took a bachelor’s degree; but his brother not being able to obtain any preferment after he left the college, Oliver, by the advice of a relation, turned his thoughts to the study of physic; and, after attending some courses of anatomy in Dublin, proceeded, in the year 1752, to Edinburgh, where he studied the several branches of medicine under the different professors in that university. But his thoughtless disposition soon involved him in difficulties; and he was obliged to leave Scotland precipitately, in consequence of engaging to pay a considerable sum of money for a fellow student. A few days afterwards, about the beginning of the year 1754⅛ he arrived at Sunderland, near Newcastle, where he was arrested at the suit of a tailor in Edinburgh, to whom he had given security for his friend. But by the good offices of Mr Laughlan Maclane and Dr Sleigh, he was soon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his passage on board a Dutch ship to Rotterdam, where, after a short stay, he proceeded to Brussels. He then visited the greater part of Flanders; and, after passing some time at Strasburg and Louvain, where he obtained the degree of bachelor of physic, he accompanied an English gentleman to Berne and Geneva, in Switzerland.\n",
      "It is undoubted that this ingenious but unfortunate person travelled on foot during the greater part of his tour. He had left England with very little money; and being of a philosophical turn, and at that time possessing a body capable of sustaining every fatigue, and a heart not easily appalled at danger, he became an enthusiast in the design he had formed of seeing the manners of different countries. He had some knowledge of the French language and of music, and he played tolerably well on the German flute; which, from an amusement, became at some times his only means of subsistence. His learning produced him a hospitable reception at most of the religious houses; and his music made him welcome to the peasants of Flanders and other parts of Germany. “Whenever I approached a peasant’s house towards night-fell,” said he, “I played one of my most merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day; but in truth I must own, whenever I attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance odious, and never made me any return for my endeavours to please them.”\n",
      "On Goldsmith s arrivai at Geneva, he was recommended as a proper person for a travelling tutor to a young man who had been unexpectedly left a considerable sum of money by his uncle, formerlyan eminent pa wnbroker near Holborn. Inis youth, who had been articled to an attorney, determined, on receipt of his fortune, to see the world; and, on his engaging with his preceptor, made a provision that he should be permitted to govern himself; but Goldsmith soon found his pupil understood extremely well the art of managing his money concerns, avarice being, in fact, his ruling passion. His questions were usually how money might be saved, which was the least expensive course of travelling, and whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again in London. Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing he was ready enough to look at; but if the sight of them required to be paid for, he usually asserted that he had been told they were not worth seeing. A companion of this turn could not be much to Goldsmith's taste, and in truth must have been intolerable to any one. During his continuance in Switzerland he assiduously cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given some proofs even whilst at Edinburgh. It was from this country that he sent the first sketch of his poem called the Traveller to his brother the clergyman in Ireland, who, giving up fame and fortune, had retired with an amiable wife, to happiness and obscurity, on an income of only L.40 a year. From Geneva Mr Goldsmith and his pupil visited the south of France, where the young man, upon some disagreement with his preceptor, paid him the small part of his salary which was due, and embarked at Marseilles for England. Our wanderer was thus left once more at large in the wide world, and passed through a variety of difficulties in traversing the greater part of France. At length his curiosity being satiated, he bent his course towards England, and arrived at Dover in the year 1756.\n",
      "When he reached London, his stock of cash did not amount to a couple of shillings; and being an entire stranger in the metropolis, his mind was filled with the most gloomy reflections on his embarrassed situation. With some difficulty he discovered the part of the town in which his old acquaintance Dr Sleigh resided. This gentleman received him with the warmest affection, and liberally invited him to share his purse until some establishment could be procured for him. Unwilling, however, to be a burden to his friend, Goldsmith, a short time afterwards, embraced an offer which was made him to assist Dr Milner in instructing young gentlemen at an academy at Peckham; and for a short time he acquitted himself greatly to the doctor’s satisfaction. But having obtained some reputation by some criticisms he had written in the Monthly Review, Mr Griffith, the proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of that work; and, resolving to pursue the profession of writing, he returned to London, as the mart where abilities of every kind were sure to meet distinction and reward. As his finances were by no means in a good state, he determined to adopt a plan of the strictest economy, and took lodgings in an obscure court in the Old Bailey, where he wrote several ingenious little pieces. Mr Newberry, who was at that time a great encourager of men of literary abilities, became a patron of our author, and introduced him as a writer in the Public Ledger, in which his Citizen of the World originally appeared, under the title of Chinese Letters.\n",
      "Fortune now seemed to bestow some notice on a man whom she had long neglected. The simplicity of his character, the integrity of bis heart, and the merit of his productions, made his company acceptable to a number of respectable families; and he emerged from his shabby apartments in the Old Bailey to the politer air of the Temple, where he took handsome chambers, and lived in a genteel style. The publication of his Traveller, and his Vicar of Wakefield, was followed by the performance of his comedy of the Good-Natured Man at Covent Garden Theatre; a production which placed him in the first rank of the poets of the age.\n",
      "Amongst many persons of distinction who were desirous to know him was the Duke of Northumberland; and the circumstance which attended his introduction to that nobleman is worthy of being related, as showing a striking trait of his character. “I was invited,” said the doctor, as he was then universally called, “by my friend Mr Percy, to wait upon the duke, in consequence of the satisfaction he had received from the perusal of one of my . productions. I dressed myself in the best manner I could, and, after studying some compliments I thought necessary on such an occasion, proceeded to Northumberland House, and acquainted the servants that I had particular business with his grace. They showed me into an antichamber; where, after waiting some time, a gentleman very genteelly dressed made.his appearance. Taking him for the duke, I delivered all the fine things I had composed in order to compliment him on the honour he had done me; when, to my great astonishment, he told me I had mistaken him for his master, who would see me immediately. At that instant the duke came into the apartment, and I was so confused on the occasion, that I wanted words barely sufficient to express the sense I entertained of the duke’s politeness, and went away extremely chagrined at the blunder I had committed.” Absence, simplicity, credulity, and entire ignorance of the world, appear to have formed the principal elements in the character of this amiable but somewhat eccentric man of genius. He was indeed “in wit a man, simplicity a child.”\n",
      "Previously to the publication of his Deserted Village, the bookseller had given him a note for a hundred guineas for the copyright, which the doctor mentioned a few hours afterwards to one of his friends, who observed, it was a very great sum for so short a performance. “In truth,” replied Goldsmith, “I think so too; I have not been easy since I received it, therefore I will go back and return him his note.” This he absolutely did, and left it entirely to the bookseller to pay him acc\n",

      "a portion of Andalusia, in Spain, being one of those four districts denominated kingdoms, into which that rich province is divided. It is bounded on the west by Seville, on the north by Jaen and Murcia, on the east by Murcia, and on the south by the Mediterranean Sea. Its extent is 805 square leagues, and the number of its inhabitants 1,097,098. The density of the population on the plains is greater than in any other part of Spain; but as a great proportion of the country is covered with lofty, and in many parts uninhabitable mountains, it is not much more thickly peopled than the general average of the kingdom. The mountains of Granada are much higher than any other range in Europe; for though the extreme summit of Mont Blanc is somewhat higher than the most elevated peak of the Sierra Nevada, yet none of the other points in the Alps attains the same altitude. The ridge called, from its being perpetually covered witlι snow, the Sierra Nevada, runs from north-east to south-west. .Geometrical levels were taken in 1804, and the highest peaks were found to be, Mulahacen, 12,762 feet, and Picacho de Veleta, 12,459 feet, above the level of the sea. The height at which perpetual snow is’ to be found is 9915 feet. In the winter indeed it descends considerably lower, but above that line it never wholly melts so as to discover the surface. This range of mountains declines gradually towards the south till it approaches Almeria, where it again rises to the height of 7800 feet on the Sierra de Gador. This sierra is a solid rock of marble, without any other covering than the snow, which lies on the higher parts of it three quarters of the year, and only totally melts in the hottest months of summer. Near it is the singular rock called Filabres, which appears to be an enormous pyramid of white marble, 2000 feet in height, and four miles in circumference at the base; and has no mixture of any other stones or earth with it. To the eastward of the range of the Sierra Nevada the mountains called the Apuxarras extend to the sea, and stretch from Almeria to Motril on the coast of the Mediterranean, about seventeen leagues. This range of mountains may be considered as a very sterile tract of country in general, but on it are mixed plains and valleys which are highly fruitful, and nourish considerable herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats, and besides feed great abundance of pigs, which furnish hams in considerable quantities. The plains interspersed in this mountain range afford great quantities of mulberry trees, on which silk worms are reared, and their produce is one of the foundations of the silk manufactories of the capital. It was to these mountains that the Moorish race was removed on the final subjection of their capital to Ferdinand; and the industry they displayed seems to have been continued by the other inhabitants, after the remainsof that singular race were most impoliticly and wickedly banished from these mountain retreats to the shores of Africa.\n",
      "Besides these mountains on the eastern division, there are many ranges between the capital and Gibraltar, which, though they do not equal them in height, exhibit a grandeur and sublimity both pleasing and awful. Amongst these may be classed the Sierra Vermcja and the Sierra de Ar-boto, which approach the coast near Marvella, and the Sierra Junquilla on the road to Ronda. These, though slightly sprinkled with snow, have no permanent covering of that substance, except during the winter months.\n",
      "The rivers of Granada are the Xenil and the Darro, issuing from the Sierra Nevada; the Guadalhora, which rises in the mountains near Antequera, and waters the most fertile of its valleys; and the Guadiaro, which issues from the mountains near Ronda.\n",
      "The valleys of Granada deserve attention, from being perhaps the most fertile spots in Europe, and yielding with but little labour the richest productions of nature in the greatest abundance. Amongst these is prominent the Vega or plain of Granada, if that can be called a valley which is 2400 feet above the level of the sea. This plain, however, is so surrounded by the loftiest mountains, that it is in effect, and has in appearance, all the properties of a rich valley. The melted snow from the Sierra Nevada is perpetually descending in the form of transparent rivulets; and the industry of the inhabitants has been constantly directed to conducting these into such channels as can most effectually irrigate the lands. As the melting of the ice and snow proceeds most rapidly in the warmest weather, the summer months, the parched land, which most requires moisture, is thus provided with it most copiously. The decomposition of the rocks which surround the plain is constantly proceeding, and the rapid torrents derived from the melting of the snow bring into the plain a constant succession of new soil, which in spreading itself over the land by the process of irrigation, refreshes the earth, and invigorates vegetation. The highest enjoyment a practical agri culturist of good observation can have, is in riding over this plain, and viewing the rapid progress of vegetation, the rich productions of the soil, and the admirable skill displayed in dispensing the refreshing streams which descend from the lofty mountains.\n",
      "In the midst of this plain, and in the most fruitful and delightful part of it, is that estate which, by the gratitude of the Spanish nation, has been conferred on the Duke of Wellington. The Sota de Roma is a fine tract of land, about five miles in length and two miles in breadth. It was retained by Ferdinand at the conquest of Granada, and made an appendage to the crown; and several successive monarchs used it as a retreat from the cares of a throne. Having been granted to Wall when prime minister of Spain, he rebuilt the mansion in part, and fitted it up in the best taste. He improved the grounds, laid out gardens, and made roads through the woods, which he stocked with game of all kinds, but especially pheasants, a species of bird which does not generally thrive in other parts of Spain. At his decease it reverted to tl>c crown, and was afterwards granted to Godoy, prince of the peace; but on his forfeiture it came again into the possession of the government, when it was granted in perpetuity to the Duke of Wellington. More than four thousand acres are woodland, and abound with good elm trees, the right of cutting which used to be reserved by the crown. The other part of this domain is excellent cultivated land, with great facilities of irrigation, and produces most extraordinary crops of wheat, barley, hemp, flax, and fruits of all kinds.\n",
      "The parts of the plain near Alhama yield prodigious crops of wheat and barley. They are cultivated in open fields at a distance from towns or even villages. At seed time the proprietors with their labourers pitch tents on the ground, and remain at the fields till the seed is deposited. At the harvest, tents are again pitched; the inhabitants of the town fill them, and continue in the fields till the whole of the produce is cut and thrashed out. This last operation is performed on a thrashing floor in the open air. In each large division of com-land there is a circular portion, very level, paved with large stones; on these thrashing floors the com is piled in the straw, and a number of unbroken horses, or more commonly mares, are held by long reins, and driven round the circle. By their treading the corn is separated from the straw with great facility. The dry state which the straw is brought to by the time it is cut makes it separate with but little labour; and from this dryness of the straw, it is so broken in the operation of thrashing, that it becomes like our chopped straw, and is carefully preserved in that condition as food for cattle in those dry months when no vegetation is visible in the meadows. This plan of thrashing the com on floors in the fields where it grew is derived from high antiquity, and its practicŧ may be seen in the sacred writings at the time of the patriarch Abraham. So dry is the climate of Spain, that the corn could not be carried to a distance, even if the roads were good and wheel carriages were used, without shaking out the greater part of the grain. After this description of the mode of harvesting the grain, it need not be added that bams are not necessary appendages to a com farm. The straw in the broken state here described is formed into stacks, and the grain, when separated from the straw, and by a flapping wheel from the chaff, is deposited in paniers, and conveyed on the backs of asses to the granaries of the proprietors in the towns, where, for the most part, and not on their farms, they reside. In some parts of Granada there is a mode of preserving wheat for many years without its sustaining any injury. In caves hewn in the granite rocks they carefully line the bottom and sides with chaff or the finest of the broken straw; the caverns are then filled with the grain in bulk, and the top covered with chaff to the thickness of about eighteen inches. In tlιis state no humidity can reach it from without; and the heat of the climate having perfectly dried it in the process of harvesting, it may remain secure for almost any period. Some repositories of this kind made by the Moors three centuries ago have been discovered within recent periods, and the grain was as good as when first deposited. It was the practice of the’ Moors, on the birth of a child, to lay up its future portion in grain, concealed in these caves, which, from the turbulent state of the country, were usually in as secret spots as they could select. When the child reached maturity his property was pointed out and his provision appropriated; but sometimes those who knew of the secret deposit were cut off, and the grain remained bŵried without discovery.\n",

      "Sir Henry Wotton recommends that a granary should be made to look towards the north, because that quarter is the coolest and most temperate. Mr Worlidge observes, that the best granaries are built of brick, with quarters of timber wrought in the inside, to which the boards, with which the inside of the granary must be lined, must be nailed so close to the bricks that there may not be any room left for vermin to shelter themselves. There may be many storeys one above another, but these should be near the one to the other, because the shallower the corn lies, it is the better, and the more easily turned.\n",
      "The two great cautions to be observed in the erecting of granaries are, to make them sufficiently strong, and to expose them to the most drying winds. In many parts of England, particularly in Kent, corn is ordered in this manner. To separate it from dust and other impurities after it is thrashed, it is tossed with shovels from one end to the other of a long and large room; the lighter substances fall down in the middle of the room, and the com only is carried from side to side or from end to end of it. After this the corn is screened, and being then brought into the granaries, it is spread about half a foot thick, and turned from time to time about twice in a week; the screening of it is also repeated once a week. This sort of management is continued about two months, after which it is laid a foot thick for two months more; and during this time it is turned once a week, or twice if the season be damp, and now and then screened again. After about five or six months, it is raised to two feet thickness in the heaps, and then turned ouce or twice in a month, and screened now and then. After a year, it is laid two and a half or three feet deep, and turned once in three weeks or a month, and screened proportionally. When it has lain two years or more, it is turned once in two months, and screened once a quarter; and how long soever it be kept, the oftener the turning and screening are repeated, the better the grain will be found to be preserved. It is proper to leave an area of a yard wide on every side of the heap of corn, and other empty spaces, into which the corn may be turned and tossed as often as required. In Kent two square holes are made at each end of the floor, and a round one in the middle, by means of which the corn is thrown out of the upper into the lower rooms, and so up again, that it may be the better turned and aired. Their screens are made with two partitions, to separate the dust from the corn, which falls into a bag; and when sufficiently full this is thrown away, whilst the pure and good corn remains behind. Corn has by these means been kept in our granaries thirty years; and it is observed, that the longer it is kept the more flour it yields in proportion to the corn, and the purer and whiter the bread is, the superfluous humidity only evaporating in the keeping. At Zurich in Switzerland, corn has been kept eighty years, or longer, by methods of a similar description.\n",
      "The public granaries at Dantzick are seven, eight, or nine storeys in height, having a funnel in the midst of each floor, to let down the corn from one to another. They are built so securely, that though every way surrounded with water, the corn contracts no damp, and the vessels have the convenience of coming up to the walls to be loaded. The Russians preserve their corn in subterranean granaries of the figure of a sugar-loaf, wide below and narrow at the top, the sides being well plastered, and the top covered with stones. They are careful to have the corn well dried before it be laid into these storehouses, and often dry it by means of ovens, the summer dry weather being too short to effect this sufficiently. Dantzick is the grand storehouse or repository of the fruitful kingdom of Ppland. The wheat, barley, and rye, of a great part of the country, are there laid up in parcels of twenty, thirty, or sixty lasts in a chamber, according to the size of the room; and this is turned every day or two, to keep it sweet and fit for shipping.\n",
      "According to the rules of Vitruvius, a granary should always be at the top of a house, and have its openings only to the north or east, that the corn may not, be exposed to the damp winds from the south and west, which are very destructive to it; but the contrary winds are very necessary and wholesome, serving to cool it and absorb all external humidity. There must also be openings in the roof, to be set open in dry weather, partly to let in fresh air, and partly to let out the warm effluvia which are often emitted by the corn. The covering of the roofs should always be of tiles, because in the worst seasons, when the other openings cannot be safe, there will always be a considerable inlet for fresh air, and an issue for the vapours by their joinings, which are never close. If there happen to be any windows to the south, great care must be taken to shut them in moist weather, and in the time of the hot southern winds. There must not be a cellar or any other damp place under a granary, nor should it ever be built over stables; for in either of these cases the corn will certainly suffer by the vapours, and be rendered damp in one, and ill tasted in the other.\n",
      "Μ. Duhamel and Dr Hailes recommend various contrivances for ventilating or blowing fresh air through corn laid up in granaries or ships, in order to preserve it sweet and dry, and to prevent its being devoured by weevils or other insects. This may be done by nailing wooden bars or laths on the floor of the granary, about an inch distant from each other, when they are covered with hair-cloth only, or at the distance of two or three inches, when coarse wire-work, or basket-work of osiers, is laid under the haircloth, or when an iron plate full of holes is laid upon them. These laths may be laid across other laths, nailed at the distance of fifteen inches, and two or more inches deep, that there may be a free passage for the air under them. The under laths must come about six inches short of the wall of the granary at one end, on which a board is to be set edgewise, sloping against the wall; for, by this disposition, a large air-pipe is formed, which having an open communication with all the interstices between and under the bars, will admit the passage of air below forcibly through a hole at the extremity, and consequently carry off the moist exhalations of the corn. The ventilators for supplying fresh air may be fixed against the wall, on the inside or outside of the granary, or under the floor, or in the ceiling; but wherever they are fixed, the handle of the lever that works them must be out of the granary, otherwise the person who works them would be in danger of suffocation when the corn is fumigated with burning brimstone, as is sometimes done for destroying weevils. Small moveable ventilators will answer the purpose for ventilating corn in large bins in granaries, and may easily be moved from one bin to another. If the granary or corn ship be very long, the main air-pipe may pass lengthwise along the middle of it, and convey air on both sides under the corn. In large granaries, double ventilators laid upon each other may be fixed at the middle and near the top of the granary, that they may be worked by a windmill fixed on the roof of the building, or by a water-mill. The air is conveyed from the ventilators through a large trunk or trunks, reaching down through the several doors to the bottom of the granary, with branching trunks to each floor, by means of which it may be made to pass into a large trunk along the adjoining cross walls; and from these tnιnks several lesser trunks, about four inches wide, branch off, at the distance of three or four feet from one another, and reach through the whole length of the granary, their farther ends being closed. Scams of one tenth or one twelfth of an inch should also be left open at the four joinings of the boards, where they are nailed together, that the air may pass through them into the corn. In some of these lesser trunks there may be sliding shutters, to stop the passage of the air through those trunks which are not covered with iron, or to ventilate one part of the granary more briskly than others, as there may be occasion. There should also be wooden shutters, hung on hinges at their upper part, so as to shut close of themselves; and these should be fixed to openings in the walls of the granary on their outside; by which means they will readily open to give a free passage for the ventilating air, which ascends through the corn, but will instantly shut when the ventilation ceases, and thereby prevent any dampness of the external air from entering. The ventilation should be made only in the middle of dry days, unless the corn, when first put in, be cold and damp.\n",
      "In lesser granaries, where the ventilators must be worked by the hand, if these granaries stand on straddles, so as to have their lowest floor at some distance from the ground, the ventilators may be fixed under the lowest floor, between the straddles, so as to be worked by men standing on the ground without or within the granary. A very commodious and cheap ventilator may be made for small granaries, by constructing a ventilator of the door of the granary, which may be easily effected by making a circular screen, of the size of a quarter of a circle, behind the door; but in order to this, the door should open, not inwards, but outwards, so that when it falls back, it may be worked to and fro in the screen, which must be exactly adapted to it in al) parts of the circular side of the screen, as well as at the top and bottom. But there must be a stop at about eight or ten inches distance from the wall, to prevent the door falling farther back, and that there may be room for a valve in the screen to supply it with air, which will b\n",

      "an illustrious Irish orator and statesman, was born at Dublin in the year 1750. His father followed the profession of barrister, and, though not remarkable for shining qualities, was industrious and prudent. Being a Protestant, the corporation of Dublin extended to him its patronage, in consequence of which he was elected as representative of the city in parliament, and made recorder. After passing through the usual course of scholastic discipline, which he did with much reputation, young Grattan was entered as a fellow-commoner in Trinity College, Dublin. Here he also greatly distinguished himself amongst contemporaries who afterwards became the chief ornaments of the senate and the bar. His original intention was to have studied for a fellowship, but the persuasions of his relatives induced him to remove to England, where he entered himself as a student of the Middle Temple. When the requisite number of terms had expired, he returned to his native country, and in the year 1772 was called to the Irish bar. His practice seems to have been small; but that his talents had already begun to make an impression, is proved by the fact, that in 1775 he was brought into the Irish parliament under the auspices of Lord Charlemont. From this period the life of Grattan became a portion, and a very conspicuous one, of the history of his country. He joined the ranks of the opposition, and the accession of strength which it thereby acquired soon became apparent. The effect of his commanding eloquence was not confined to those who listened to it in the house. He infused the patriotic spirit, with which he was himself actuated, into the country at large. It is allowed, indeed, that the volunteer bands who had begun to assemble in various parts of Ireland, acquired new confidence from the bold, uncompromising tone assumed by the young speaker; and in the course of a few years, their ranks swelled to the number of eighty thousand men, armed, disciplined, and prepared for the field. The menacing attitude which Ireland assumed at this critical period, and the boldness with which the members of the Irish opposition, particularly Grattan, contested the supremacy of the sister kingdom, induced the British legislature, in the year 1782, to repeal the statute of the 6th of George I. By this law it had been enacted that the crown of Ireland should be inseparably annexed to that of Great Britain; that Ireland should be bound by British acts of parliament, if named therein; that the Irish House of Lords should have no appellate jurisdiction; and that the last appeal, in all cases of law and equity, should lie to the British House of Peers. For Grattan's exertions in getting this statute rescinded, his country was profuse in laudatory addresses to him; and the parliament rewarded his services by a grant of L.50,000. A more magnificent donation was intended, but Grattan declined to accept it. That bestowed was large enough to inspire envy and provoke misconstruction. The following sessions of parliament were stormy; and the young patriot had to contend, amongst others, with Mr Flood, an antagonist formidable alike by his acknowledged talents and the unscrupulous virulence of his attacks. The latter maintained that the act of repeal did not involve a renunciation of the British claims, and that therefore they might be resumed and exercised at any time. This sophistry found supporters \"in both houses of parliament, and the reputation of Grattan actually began to wane. But the energy and success with which he opposed Mr Ord’s celebrated propositions, brought forward in 1785, fully re-established his fame. One of these was, that the Irish legislature should, from time to time, adopt and re-enact such statutes of the British parliament as related to the regulation of commerce. In opposing this proposal Grattan put forth all his powers, and from this period he began to be acknowledged as the leader of the country party, and as the head of the Irish Whig Club. The members of this association were reciprocally bound not to accept office under any administration which had not for its avowed principle the conceding of certain popular measures. These consisted of a bill to make the great officers of the crown responsible for their proceedings; a bill to prevent revenue officers from voting at elections; and a place and pension bill. Several other important subjects engaged the attention of Grattan at this period; and amongst these was the establishment of a provision for the clergy independently of tithes. He also brought in a bill to encourage the improvement of barren lands, by exempting reclaimed wastes from paying ecclesiastical dues during the space of seven years. But both these measures were rejected by the legislature, principally through the influence of the established church.\n",
      "About the same period Grattan strenuously advocated an extension of civil rights to his Roman Catholic countrymen. That a Protestant statesman should exert himself in behalf of those who professed a religious creed different from his own, was, at the time when Catholic emancipation was at length conceded by the British parliament, a matter of such frequent occurrence, that no personal claim to distinction could be raised upon that ground. To entertain such sentiments was not considered as sufficient to subject the person entertaining them to public suspicion as one infected witlι pernicious opinions. But during the early career of Grattan, the subject was viewed in another aspect, and through a different medium. In Ireland, whilst the heads of the Protestant church, with the majority of the Protestants, were arrayed in opposition to any concession to the Catholics, in England the tide of vulgar prejudice ran so strongly in the same direction, that a great civil convulsion had nearly arisen out of it. When these facts and circumstances are taken into consideration, the conduct of Grattan will appear in its true light, as that of a wise statesman, and a fearless patriot. His principal object was to obtain the elective franchise for the Catholics; but the administration of that day indignantly rejected the prayer of their petitions.\n",
      "On the arrival of Earl Fitzwilliam, as lord-lieutenant, in 1795, Mr Grattan attached himself to that highly popular nobleman, and under his auspices originated many plans which had for their object to promote the peace and prosperity of his native land. But the recall of his lordship put a stop to all amelioration, and at the same time generated universal discontent, which was increased by the creation of new sinecures and the lavish profusion of titles. The consequences were memorable and instructive. The society of United Irishmen, whose ostensible object was reform, but who really aimed at the independence of Ireland, acquired new courage from these dissensions, and some even proposed to establish a republic in that country. The triumph of the French Revolution had no doubt inspired these daring projectors with hopes of success. A large portion of the people adopted their principles; military associations were formed, and numbers disciplined and armed; whilst an intercourse was opened with France, by which succours and assistance were liberally promised. From the commencement of the rebellion which ensued, Mr Grattan advised measures of conciliation; and when he saw that there was no hope of stemming the general movement, he withdrew from parliament, and retired to his country residence.\n",
      "But the grand project of Mr Pitt for effecting a union between Great Britain and Ireland summoned him from his retirement. He obtained a seat in parliament for the express purpose of opposing that measure, which, he maintained, would prove fatal to the best interests of Ireland. Its success did not, however, prevent him from accepting a seat in the imperial parliament, and there employing his talents and eloquence for the benefit of both countries. He was chosen, in 1805, to represent the small borough of Malton; and in the year following he was returned as one of the members for Dublin. Throughout the remainder of his career, his public conduct continued to evince the purest patriotism and the most undeviating consistency, illustrated by an eloquence fraught with the finest inspirations of genius and liberty. Notwithstanding the uniform and vehement opposition of the corporation of the city which he represented, he continued to advocate the Catholic claims with equal zeal and ability. Accordingly, towards the close of his life, we find him complying with an unanimous requisition on the part of the Catholics of Ireland, to present their petition to the British parliament, and to give it his support. Some of his friends represented the fulfilment of this duty as incompatible with his health, which had now begun to decline; but he nobly replied, that “he would be happy to die in the discharge of his duty.” This event did actually take place; for he expired on the 14th of May 1820, soon after his arrival in London; and bis remains were interred in Westminster Abbey.\n",
      "It is comparatively easy for posterity to judge for themselves of the moral and political qualities of a statesman's character, because these can be dispassionately determined from the information afforded by history as to the course of conduct which he had pursued, and the measures which he had supported. If Mr Grattan be thus estimated, he must ever be accounted one of the most ardent, consistent, and patriotic of modern statesmen. Viewing him as an orator, we can only judge of his excellence by the report of contemporaries, who but rarely agree in such matters. We are informed· that he had to contend with an indifferent voice, which was thin, and, considered simply as an organ of sound, unequal to the expression of impassioned feelings. His action, too, was seldom elegant or graceful, but it possessed a far higher character; it was forcible and energetic. Animation and ardour predominated in his\n",

      "one of the most distinguished men of letters that the kingdom of Naples ever produced, was bom at Rogiano, a small town near Cosenza, in Calabria-Ulteriore, on the 20th of January 1664. His parents, who, by their station and their fortune, held the first rank in the place, neglected nöthing to promote his early education; but the precocity of mind, the vivacity of imagination, and the ardour to instruct himself evinced by their son, soon made them sensible that he required other cares at their hands, and needed to be restrained rather than stimulated. Gregorio Caloprese, his uncle, after having cultivated, with success, at Naples, poetry and philosophy, had retired to his native place, Scalea, a maritime city in that part of Calabria. The education of a nephew, who inspired so high hopes, appeared to him an agreeable task, and he willingly undertook it. Under the auspices of his uncle, young Ġravina learned Latin, rhetoric, history, and the principles of geometry; acquisitions well calculated to pave the way for the study of philosophy, which was then beginning to cast off the yoke under which it had languished in the schools. Thus occupied, Gravina attained his sixteenth year, when Caloprese, finding that the education of his nephew, on which he had bestowed so great care, required his removal to another and wider field, desired to conduct him to Naples; but some domestic embarrassments obstructed the proposed arrangement, and the young student might have been left to his fate, had not his generous relation taken on himself the expense of carrying this proposal into effect, and sent him to the capital, with a strong recommendation to Seraphino Biscardi of Cosenza, then considered as the head of the Neapolitan bar. Charmed with the dispositions evinced by Gravina, Biscardi divided his attentions between him and Cajetano Argentin, particularly directing the application of the former towards Greek, in which he had only received a few lessons from his uncle, but of which he soon acquired a perfect knowledge under Gregorio Massere, then regarded as the first Hellenist of Naples. In the mean time Biscardi taught them all the secrets of the art of oratory, not forgetting that of declamation; but Gravina, who at the same time cultivated poetry', did not so far abandon this pursuit as to devote himself exclusively to the study of eloquence.· It was about this time in fact that he composed, on the subject of the Passion, a drama, entitled Tragedia di Cristo ; a piece which has not been printed, but which he most probably translated, with some additions, from the Greek drama of the same name attributed to Gregory of Nazianzen. Of another drama also composed by Gravina, there remains only the title, Sanť Atanasio. As the relations of Gravina had destined him for the profession of the law, the time was now approaching when it would be necessary to make jurisprudence a serious study; but for that science he had conceived an aversion which appeared to be insurmountable. The barbarous language of chicane, as he considered the technical nomenclature of the law, appeared to him an offence committed against the worship of the muses, and the riches which the bar often produces, a sordid means of existence. Biscardi had much difficulty in convincing him of the difference which exists between the science of laws, and the mere conduct of processes, or ordinary practice. He repeated, for some time in vain, that this science rests on a profound knowledge of the classics; and that, if modern jurisconsults had corrupted the Latįnity of the schools, it might still be brought back to the standard of the purer ages of Alciat and Cujas. The prejudices of Gravina at length vanished; he applied himself vigorously to the study of the civil and canon law, and at the same time extended his knowledge of theology by an attentive perusal of the works of the Fathers. He sought the conversation of the learned, and continually studied the five books which he regarded as the sources of the knowledge to which he aspired; we mean the Holy Scriptures, the body of the civil law, the works of Plato, those of Cicero, and the poems of Homer. Gravina had long desired to visit Rome; but his uncle, Caloprese, who still superintended his education, opposed his wish until he should have completed his course of study. When this was accomplished, he repaired to the ancient capital of the world in 1689. Paolo Coardo, of Turin, afterwards chamberlain to Clement XI. received him into his house, where he remained several years, and also procured him the acquaintance of the most celebrated men of their time, Cianιpini, Fabretti, Bianchini, Buonaroti, Emmanuel Martino, and Father Miro. In conversation, they were accustomed to discuss the most important questions; and aβ it often turned upon the relaxation of morals, Gravina undertook to treat this subject, applying to it the theological knowledge which he had acquired in the course of his studies. Accordingly, in 1691, he published, under the supposititious name of Priscus Censorinus, a dialogue, entitled De corrupta Morali Doctrina, Naples, 4to, the object of which was to prove that the corrupters of morals do more injury to the church than the boldest heresiarchs. Gravina was then only twenty-six years of age. But the eloquence of the style and the solidity of the reasonings ensured the success of the book, which at the same time excited lively dissatisfaction amongst the numerous partisans of convenient doctrines and loose practice. Father Concina has inserted this dialogue almost entire in his treatise De Incredulis. Nor did poetry escape the contamination which had so deeply infected morals. A single writer, Alessandro Guidi, a friend of Gravina, struggled at Rome against the prevailing debasement of taste, and, at the request of Christina, queen of Sweden, had, under the Arcadian name of Erillo Cleoneo, written a comedy, entitled Endimione. As this piece became the object of the most virulent attacks, Gravina, under the name of Bione Crateo, undertook the defence of his friend, which he read in a literary assembly, and which was afterwards printed under the title of Discorso sσpra Endimione, Rome, 1692. This little work, in which he laid down excellent’ principles, drew upon the author new adversaries, who considered it equally strange and unpardonable that Gravina should attempt to constitute himself at once the censor of morals and the reformer of taste. A jealousy, almost amounting to fury, was excited against the young Neapolitan; whilst his disposition to censure the works of others, and the confidence which he appeared to repose in his own opinions, were but little calculated to calm the spirits of his enemies. Gravina sometimes commended, but he more frequently censured, and his decisions were often expressed in contemptuous terms. This tendency made him a host of enemies. His least actions were watched in order to calumniate him, and he was assailed with the most malignant invectives. Then appeared in succession, under the name of Quintio Settano, the Arcadian alias of Ludovico Sergardi, sixteen satires against Philodemus, the name under which Gravina was therein designated. These satires, which were equally spirited and bitter, obtained great success, and were circulated in profusion. Gravina at first affected indifference. It is a fault of the age, said he, to take pleasure in outraging merit. But as this tranquillity did not reduce his enemies to silence, he could no longer restrain his resentment, and composed some declamations of the nature of verrine, and also some iambics; but he has not published these retaliatory effusions, probably because he thought them inferior to the satires of Settano. The malignity of the enemies of Gravina did not lessen the esteem which he had inspired, nor abate his zeal for useful and wholesome pursuits. He united with several other literary men who had associated together for the purpose of cultivating poetry in silence. There were only fifteen of them, but their number soon increased, and Gravina assembled them for the first time, in November 1695, at a house which he had provided for the purpose on Mount Janiculum. They framed for the association a democratic constitution, and took the name of Arcadi, or Area-dians. In summer, they were to assemble in the gardens, and there invoke the Muses: and, by their manner of living and the simplicity of their writings, they were to endeavour to imitate the ancient shepherds, without distinction of rank or fortune. Each assumed a pastoral name. As the number of members increased, it became necessary to give laws to the association, and decemvirs were named for the purpose of preparing them. Called to discharge this duty, Gravina reviewed the numerous and incoherent regulations adopted by the Arcadians, and reduced them into a single code. These laws, written in Latin, with an elegant conciseness, and rare propriety in the selection of terms, in imitation of those of the Twelve Tables, soon spread throughout Europe, and were universally admired. Lastly, on the 20th of May 1696, the Arcadi held a general assembly on the Palatine Hill. Gravina, after an eloquent discourse, presented the marble tablets containing the laws, which he established with the expressions consecrated in the Roman jurisprudence, and on this occasion also he assumed the name of Opizio Eri-manteo. During this period, Gravina had composed several dissertations, which he collected under the title of Opuscula, Rome, 1696, and in which are included, 1. Specimen prisci Juris; 2. De Lingua Latina dialogus; 3. Epistola ad Gabrielern Reignerium à Gallum; 4. De contemptu Mortis; 5. Epistola ad Trojanum Mirabellam; and, 6. Delie Favole Antiche, which has been translated into French by Joseph Regnauld. After the death of Alexander VIII.

      "a mixed colour partaking of the two extremes of black and white. See Dyeing. Gray, Lady Jane. See Grey. Gray, Thomas, an eminent English poet, was the youngest and only surviving son of Philip Gray, a citizen and money-scrivener of London, and was born in Cornhill, on the 20th of December 1716. He was educated at Eton, where he contracted a friendship with Horace Walpole, afterwards Earl of Orford, and with Mr Richard West, son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Mr West and Mr Gray were both intended for the bar; but the former died early in life, and the latter was diverted from that pursuit by an invitation to accompany Mr Walpole in his travels, which he accepted, without any fixed plan for his future life. During his travels, which included the customary tour through France and Italy, he wrote a variety of letters to Mr West and to his parents, which are printed with his poems, and full of interest. Architecture, Gothic as well as Grecian, painting and music, with the manners and customs of the people, were all studied by him with success. But, whilst at Reggio, an unfortunate difference took place between him and Walpole, and they parted in mutual displeasure. A great deal has been said of this quarrel, but the real cause of it has never been sufficiently explained. Walpole, however, affected to take the blame on himself, and in doing so he was very probably right. On his return, Gray finding himself in narrow circumstances, yet with a mind indisposed to active employment, retired to Cambridge, where he devoted himself to study; and soon afterwards his friend West died. The melancholy impressed on him by this event may be traced in his admired Elegy written in a Country Churchyard; which is believed to have been begun, if not finished, about this time, though the conclusion, as it stands at present, is certainly different from what it was in the original manuscript copy. The first impulse of hie sorrow for the death of his friend gave birth to a tender sonnet in English, written on the model of Petrarch; and also to a sublime apostrophe in hexameter verse, with which he intended to commence one of his books De Principiis Cogitandi.\n",
      "From the winter of the year 1742 till the day of his death, his principal residence was at Cambridge, whence he seldom was absent for any considerable time, except between the years 1759 and 1762, when, on the opening of the British Museum, he took lodgings in Southampton Row, in order to have access to the Harleian and other manuscripts there deposited, from which he made several curious extracts, amounting in all to a tolerably sized folia volume.\n",
      "About the year 1747, Mason, afterwards the editor of his poems, was introduced to Gray. The former had written, a year or two before, some imitations of Milton’s juvenile poems, particularly a Monody on the Death of Pope, and two pieces entitled II Bellicoso and II Pacifico, on the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle; and the latter had revised them at the request of a friend. This laid the foundation of an intimacy which continued without interruption until the death of Gray.\n",
      "About the year 1750, Mr Gray having put the last touches to his Elegy written in a Country Churchyard, communicated it to Walpole, who was too much charmed with it to withhold it from his acquaintance. Accordingly it was shown about for some time in manuscript, and received with all the applause which it so justly merited. At last the publisher of one of the magazines having surreptitiously obtained a copy, Gray wrote to Walpole, desiring that he would put the manuscript into the hands of Mr Dodsley, and order him to print it immediately. This proved the most popular of all our author’s publications. It passed through eleven editions in a very short space of time, and was translated into Latin, first by Ansty and Roberts, and afterwards by Lloyd.\n",
      "From July 1759 till the year 1762, Gray resided generally in London, with the view, as we have already mentioned, of having more ready access to the British Museum. In the summer of 1765 he undertook a journey to Scotland for the benefit of his health, which was then in a precarious state, and having passed through Edinburgh and Perth, he proceeded to Glammis Castle, the seat of Lord Strathmore, where he resided for some time; after which he visited the north, where he formed an acquaintance with Dr Beattie, then but little known beyond the immediate circle of his friends at Aberdeen. Gray’s account of this journey is praised by Dr Johnson as curious and elegant; “for,” says the doctor, “as his comprehension was ample, his curiosity extended to all the works of art, all the appearances of nature, and all the monuments of past events.” Part of the summers of 1766 and 1767 he passed in journeys in England; and he had intended to make a second tour in Scotland, but returned to London without accomplishing his design. In July 1768 his grace the Duke of Grafton wrote him a polite letter, informing him that his majesty had been graciously pleased to offer to him the professorship of modem history in the university of Cambridge, then vacant by the accidental death of Mr Brocket. This place was valuable in itself, as the salary amounted to L.400 a year; but what rendered it particularly acceptable to Mr Gray was its being given him without solicitation. He was indeed remarkably disinterested or indifferent about money in all his pursuits. Though his income, before this addition, was but small, he never read oι wrote with a view of rendering his labours useful to himself. He may be said to have been one of the few personages connected with literature, especially the poetical department, who are devoid of selfishness, and at the same time attentive to economy; and he was also amongst mankind in general one of those rare economists, who possess that talent, untinctured with the slightest stain of avarice. When his circumstances were at the lowest, he gave away such sums in private charity as would have done credit to an ampler purse. But what chiefly deterred him from seeking any advantage by his literary pursuits, was a certain degree of pride, which led him to despise the idea of being thought an author by profession.\n",
      "It is probable, however, that early in life he had an intention of publishing an edition of Strabo; for his papers contain a great number of notes and geographical disquisitions on that author, particularly respecting that part of Asia which comprehends Persia and India. The indefatigable pains which he had bestowed on the writings of Plato, and the quantity of critical as well as explanatory observations which he left upon almost every part of that ancient philosopher’s works, plainly indicate that no man in Europe was better prepared to republish and illustrate them than Mr Gray. Another work, on which he had bestowed uncommon labour, was the Anthologie. In an interleaved copy of that collection of Greek epigrams, he has transcribed several additional ones, which he selected in his extensive reading, inserted a great number of critical notes and emendations, and also subjoined a copious index. But whether he intended this performance for the press or not, has not been ascertained. The only work which he meditated with a direct view to publication from the beginning, was a history of English Poetry, upon a plan sketched out by Pope. He has mentioned this himself in an advertisement to the three fine imitations of Norse and Welsh poetry which he gave the world in the last edition of his poems. But after he had made considerable preparations for the execution of this design, and Mason had proffered his assistance, he was informed that Mr Wharton, of Trinity College, Oxford, was engaged in a work of the same kind. The undertaking was therefore relinquished by mutual consent; and s∞n afterwards, upon that gentleman desiring a sight of the plan, Gray readily sent him a copy of it.\n",
      "Amongst other sciences which he cultivated, Gray had acquired a great knowledge of Gothic architecture. He had seen and accurately studied on the spot, whilst abroad, the Roman proportions, both in ancient times, and in the works of Palladio. In his later years he applied himself to study those stupendous structures of more modem date which adorn our own country, and which, if they have not the same grace, undoubtedly possess at least equal dignity, with those of ancient times. He endeavoured to trace this mode of building from its commencement through the various changes it underwent, until it arrived at its perfection in the reign of Henry VIII. and ended in that of Elizabeth. For this purpose, he did not so much rely upon written accounts, as on that internal evidence which the buildings themselves exhibit of their respective antiquity; since they constantly furnish to the well-informed eye, arms, ornaments, and other marks, by which their several ages may be ascertained. On this account he applied himself to the study of heraldry as a preparatory science; and he has left behind him a number of genealogical papers, more than sufficient to prove him a complete master of that subject. By these means he attained such prompt sagacity in architectural matters, as to be enabled to pronounce, at first sight, the precise time when every particular part of any of our cathedrals was erected. But the favourite study of Gray for the last ten years of his life was natural history, which he then rather resumed than commenced; for, by the instructions of his uncle An-trobus, he was a considerable botanist at the age of fifteen. The marginal notes which he has left on Linnaeus and other writers on the vegetable, animal, and fossil kingdoms, are very numerous; but the most considerable are those on ' Hudson’s Flora Anglica, and the tenth edition of the Systema Natura·, which he interleaved and filled almost entirely. Whilst employed on zoology, he read with great care Aristotle’s treatise on that subject, and explained many difficult passages of that obscure ancie\n",

      "a famous alchemist and enthusiast of the sixteenth century, was born in 1493, at Einsiedeln, a small town of the canton of Schwitz, distant some leagues from Zurich. His father, who practised medicine at Villach in Carinthia, was a near relative of George Bombast de Hohenheim, who afterwards became grand-prior of the order of Malta; so that Paracelsus was not sprung from the dregs of the people, as his sworn enemy, Erastus, pretends. His early education appears to have been neglected, and he passed a part of his youth leading the life of a strolling schoolman of that period; in other words, he wandered from country to country, predicting future events by inspecting the stars and the lines of the hand, conjuring up the dead, and repeating various operations in alchemy and magic, into which he had been initiated either by his father, or by different ecclesiastics, amongst whom he mentions the abbot Trithcim, and several German bishops. As Paracelsus everywhere shows himself ignorant of the most common and elementary parts of knowledge, it is not probable that he had ever seriously studied in the schools. He contented himself with visiting the universities of Germany, France, and Italy; and although he boasts of having been the ornament of these schools, there is no evidence of his having legitimately acquired the title of doctor, which he chose to assume. All we know is, that he laboured for a long time in the house of a certain rich man, named Sigismond Fugger de Schwatz, in order to learn from him the secret of the philosopher’s stone. According to the usage of the alchemists, Paracelsus travelled into the mountains of Bohemia, Sweden, and the East, to inspect the labours of the miners, get himself initiated into the mysteries of the oriental adepts, and observe the wonders of nature, particularly the celebrated magnetic mountain. He is also said to have traversed Spain, Portugal, France, Prussia, Poland, and Transylvania, communicating not only with the physicians, but also with the old women, quacks, and magicians of these different countries. It is even believed that he extended his travels as far as Egypt and Tartary, and that he accompanied the son of the Khan of the Tartars to Constantinople, in order to learn of a Greek who resided in that capital the secret of the tincture or elixir of Trismegistus. This vagabond life naturally left Paracelsus very little time for reading; and, in fact, he has himself stated, that during the space of ten years he .did not open a single book, and that all his medical library consisted of about a dozen pages. Nor did his desire of knowledge increase with his years; for an inventory made after his death shows, that the only books which he left behind him were a Bible, a Concordance, a New Testament, the Commentaries of St Jerome on the Gospels, a volume on medicine, and some seven manuscripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not known at what period he returned to Germany; but it appears that, about the age of thirty-three, several remarkable cures, which he wrought on persons of distinction, gave him such celebrity, that in 1526, he was, on the recommendation of OEcolampadius, called to fill the chair of physic and surgery in the university of Basil. Here Paracelsus commenced his career by burning publicly in the hall the works of Avicenna and Galen; assuring his auditors, that his shoe-ties knew more than these two physicians, that all the universities, and all the writers united, were less instructed than the hairs of his beard, and that he should be regarded as the sole monarch of physic. The novelty of his doctrine, the confidence with which he spoke of his success, the power to which he pretended of prolonging life, and curing the most inveterate diseases, and the use of the vulgar tongue in his discourses, attracted to Basil a crowd of credulous persons, equally indolent and enthusiastic. The prelections which he delivered on practical medicine have fortunately been preserved; they are in a mixed jargon of German and barbarous Latin, and contain nothing but a multitude of empirical remedies, indicated with the greatest pretension. So much impudence, however, far from diminishing his renown, served only to increase it, insomuch that Erasmus, who had long suffered from gravel, applied to Paracelsus; and this circumstance led to a correspondence (which has been preserved) between these two men, who enjoyed such opposite kinds of celebrity. But even at Basil people soon began to discover that the new professor was an impudent and presumptuous quack. Scarcely had a year elapsed when his prelections were deserted. As soon as the novelty wore off, his jargon was found to be incomprehensible, and his empiricism a mere cloak for ignorance. But what contributed more than any other cause to ruin his reputation was the crapulous life which he led. According to Oporin, who lived two years with him, he almost never appeared in his lecture-room without being half drunk, and seldom dictated to his secretaries except under the influence of wine. If called to visit a patient, he rarely did so without having first gorged himself with liquor. He had the custom of sleeping in his clothes, and sometimes passed whole nights in low taverns drinking with peasants, so that in the morning he had not the slightest recollection of what had passed during the night. On one occasion, however, having exceeded the ordinary license of his orgies, he assailed a magistrate with the grossest abuse; and, dreading punishment for such an outrage, found himself under the necessity of decamping from Basil, towards the end of the year 1527. He took refuge in Alsace, whither he was followed by his secretary Oporin, with all his chemical apparatus, and then resumed the same kind of strolling life which he had led in his youth.\n",
      "Being thus cast loose again upon the world, he appeared at Colmar in 1528, at Nuremberg in 1529, at Saint-Gall in 1531, at Pfeffers in 1535, and at Augsburg in 1536. He then made some stay in Moravia, where he once more compromised his reputation by the loss of some distinguished patients, and was in consequence obliged to take his departure for Vienna. From that capital he passed into Hungary, and, in 1538, appeared at Villach, where he dedicated his Chronicle to the states of Carinthia, in gratitude for the favours which they had bestowed on his father. But his stay here appears to have been short; for, in 1540, we find him at Mindelheim, whence he pro- , ceeded to Saltzburg, the ultimate term of all his wanderings. On the 24th of September 1541 he died in the hospital of St Stephen at that place, in the forty-eighth year of his age, and in a state of abject poverty; notwithstanding he pretended to the possession of the double secret of transmuting metals, and prolonging life even to the extent of several centuries.\n",
      "The life of this man forms a curious chapter in the history of self-delusion and imposture. Yet in order to judge rightly of Paracelsus, as well as of the reform which he wished to effect in medicine, it is necessary to dismiss all prejudice, and to disregard alike the hostility of Erastus and the exaggerations of Murr. It is also proper to keep in view the predominant spirit of the age in which he lived, and to remember that this epoch was famous for the reign of astrology and alchemy, the abuse of all sorts of superstitious practices, the apparition of spectres, ghosts, and hobgoblins, frequent demoniacal possessions, and the juggleries of a crowd of seers and fanatics, who, throughout all Europe, and particularly in Germany, practised on the credulity of the people. Such were the causes which prepared the way for the system of Paracelsus, and inflicts ed a severe blow on that of Galen. To speak in a vulgar language, to write rather for the people than for the learned, to introduce the cabbalistical art into medicine, as a substitute for that knowledge which is only acquired by study, to employ a crowd of mystical and barbarous terms, which make the greater impression on the multitude the less they are understood; such were the means of which Paracelsus availed himself, and which, but for his own indiscretion and misconduct, would most probably have been attended with triumphant success.\n",
      "His philosophical and medical system is curious, even by reason of its absurdity. He takes as his primary supports religion and the sacred books. He assures us that the contemplation of the perfections of the Deity is sufficient to procure all knowledge and all wisdom; that the Holy Scriptures conduct to all kinds of truth; that the Bible furnishes a key to the theory of diseases; and that magical medicine can only be learned by the study of the Apocalypse. The man who blindly obeys the will of God, and who succeeds in identifying himself with the celestial intelligences, possesses the philosopher’s stone; he can cure all diseases, and can prolong his life at pleasure, because he holds in his possession the tincture which Adam and the patriarchs employed before the Deluge to prolong the term of human existence to eight or even nine centuries. Paracelsus professed the grossest pantheism. He admitted the existence of pure spirits without souls. According to him, all beings, even the minerals and fluids, take aliments and drink, and expel faeces. His physiological theory, a confused mass of the most incoherent ideas, is founded on the application of the law of the cabbala to the demonstration of the functions of the human body. The Sun has an influence on the heart, the Moon on the brain, Jupiter on the liver, Saturn on the spleen, Mercury on the lungs, Mars on the bile, and Venus on the kidneys and the organs of generation. Before attempting to explain the functions, or to cure diseases, the physician should know the planets of the microcosm, their meridian, their zodiac, their rising and setting; and it is by means of this knowledge that he attains to the discovery of the most hidden secrets of nature.

      "formerly a province of the viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres, in South America, but declared an independent republic first in 1816, and again in 1826. It is bounded on the north by the province of Matto Grosso, in Brazil, from which it is separated partly by a river, and partly by a mountain ridge, its most northerly point being between the twentieth and twenty-first degrees of south latitude. The river Parana constitutes its boundary on the east, southeast, and south, with the exception of a comparatively small tract of country, called the Missions, which lies to the eastward, on the right bank of the Parana; and along the whole of the western side of the country flows the Paraguay, the confluence of which with the Parana, in latitude 27. 27. south, marks the limits of the country in this direction. In longitude it extends from 54.40. to 58.30. west from Greenwich, and comprehends an area of above 25,000 square miles, which is about half the superficies of England, exclusive of Wales.^[1. In drawing up this article we have been indebted for much valuable information to Mr W. P. Robertson, author of Letters on Paraguay, who was detained a considerable time in the country by Francia, and experienced in his own case the rigour of that suspicious despotism under which it now groans. ]\n",
      "The history of Paraguay, from the time of its discovery until it unfurled the standard of independence, along with the other provinces, and shook itself free from European domination, presents but little except the usual story of the oppression and aggrandisement of the whites, with the fierce struggles and the ultimate submission of the Indians. But its annals since the revolution, when its destinies were intrusted to Dr Francia, one of the most remarkable men of his time, are replete with events equally interesting and instructive. According to Techo, the word Paraguay signifies the Crowned River; a name which it obtained from the Indians who inhabited the shores of the river wearing coronets made of feathers. Dr Southey, however, is of opinion that it is the same word as Paraguazu, or Great River; and this is supported by the fact, that the same word for a river is observed in the Para and the Parana. On the other hand, Azara informs us that the river and country of Paraguay derive their name from the Payaguas, who formerly inhabited that part of Brazil through which the river flows in the early part of its course, and are now the most domesticated and useful of all the Indian tribes, with the exception of the Guaranis. This name was altered a little by the Spaniards, who, substituting one letter for another, made it Paraguay instead of Payaguay. The country was discovered in 1526, by Sebastian Cabot, who was then in the service of Spain. This intrepid navigator ascended the Paraguay thirty-four leagues above its junction with the Parana, and there met an agricultural people, inhabiting the banks, but found them too fierce, warlike, and sagacious to be ensnared by promises, or induced to come to terms. After five years of fruitless attempts at negotiation, he was compelled to abandon the enterprise; and for some time the country remained almost unnoticed. In the year 153(>, however, the Spaniards, after a sanguinary struggle with the natives, succeeded in forming a settlement; and in memory of the event, as well as in honour of the Virgin Mary, they called their fortified port Assumption. This was the origin of the capital city of that name, which increased so rapidly, that in eleven years afterwards it was considered as of sufficient importance to be constituted the seat or see of a bishop. The history of the country for fifty years after the first settlement presents merely a series of acts of hypocrisy and violence. The Guarani tribes, who inhabited Paraguay, and some other parts, were a brave but docile people; and though many lives were lost before the superiority of the Spanish power was acknowledged, yet, of all the tribes, the Guaranis, who were the most numerous, proved in the end the most easily and effectually reduced to obedience. But, satisfied with their subjugation, the Spaniards did little or nothing for their improvement; and it was not until towards the end of the sixteenth century that the Jesuits brought all the zeal and influence of their order to the task of civilizing the Guaranis, or, in other words, reducing them from a state of savage independence to one of civilized but complete subjugation. In the year 1586, the first settlement or mission of the Society of Jesus was formed in Guayra; and so rapidly did these settlements increase, that, in the year 1629, they amounted to twenty-one in number. These communities were of a threefold character, namely, religious, military, and manufacturing; for, whilst the Jesuits instructed the Indians in the elements of education and the truths of religion, they likewise trained them to habits of industry, and even taught them the art of self-defence. Each of the settlements was a considerable town laid out with straight streets. The houses, generally consisting of earth, where whitened, covered with tiles, and provided with verandas on either side, to preserve them from the sun and the rain. Each mission had a mother church, which was generally built of stone, and magnificently ornamented. Two curates, both Jesuits, were the only ecclesiastics who exercised parochial functions, and at the same time acted as inspectors of all civil economy.\n",
      "In attempting to extend their spiritual conquest still further, the Jesuits were compelled by the Paulistas to fall back to the south of the Serra Maracaju, and concentrate their establishments between the Parana and Uruguay, in that part where these rivers approximate most closely. But at a subsequent period the Jesuits acquired an ascendency in Paraguay, as far as ecclesiastical authority was concerned,; and for more than a century their influence remained unshaken. In the year 1752, when seven of the Jesuit missions were detached from Spain and annexed to Portugal, so averse were the Indians to this separation, that they had recourse to arms, and a war ensued, which is known by the name of the War of the Seven Settlements. But, after five years of hostility and bloodshed, they were entirely subdued, and their spiritual teachers, who had at first vainly urged them to submission, resumed their beneficent sway. The Jesuits, it is well known, were finally expelled from Brazil in 1760, under circumstances of unexampled cruelty; and in 1768, this was followed by their complete expulsion from Paraguay, as we learn from Cazal and the despatches of Bucarelli. During more than thirty years after this event the affairs of the country continued in a state of frightful disorder; cruelty, plunder, and misery in various forms prevailed; and the population of the Reductions, from having been upwards of 100,000, sunk to less than half that number.\n",
      "With the change of masters which followed this event, the spell that bound the Indians was broken; and by the new plan of government there was established in the Guarani towns a system which in a few years led to the total ruin of the Jesuits’ establishments. The successors of these missionaries appear to have been thoroughly embued with the worst spirit of religious bigotry, and to have possessed none of their redeeming qualities. Doblas, one of the administrators of the new system, and by far the most enlightened and efficient of their number, as well as the able historian of the Missions of Paraguay, strenuously urged the Spanish government to sanction such a change of management as would insure their preservation; and ultimately the king of Spain showed a disposition to adopt his suggestion. But it was then too late. The depopulation of the Missions was complete; and, in many places, the ruins of their churches and buildings are all that now remain to attest their having ever existed. The Jesuits have often been attacked and unsparingly calumniated by those who were interested in destroying the reputation of that celebrated order; but some authentic documents recently published will probably go far to correct many of the erroneous impressions which have thus been produced in disfavour of that body. It must always be kept in view, however, that, excepting the truly impartial testimony of Doblas, the records alluded to are the productions of decided partisans of the company of Jesus.^[2. These religionists, who acted as missionaries in Paraguay, were certainly not so bad as their enemies represented them, and yet by no means so philanthropic and disinterested as their friends have described them. Aggrandisement for themselves, and complete dependence upon the part of the Indians, were the undeviating principles of their government. Uniform and constant labour was exacted from their subjects on the one hand; and a humane, mild, paternal, and wise rule was exercised in return; in tact, the chains of the Indians sat so lightly upon them as to be wholly imperceptible to their simple and guileless minds. ]\n",
      "From the commencement of the present century until the year 1810, the country continued tranquil; but when the tocsin of revolt was sounded throughout South America and Mexico, an attempt upon the part of Buenos Ayres to supplant the governor of Paraguay led ultimately to the establishment of an independent government in that country. In the month of October 1810 the junta of Buenos Ayres despatched a thousand men under the command of Manuel Belgrano,for the purpose of vindicating their authority in Paraguay, and attaching it to the republic of the United Provinces. This army penetrated without interruption into the heart of the country, and halted within about two days’ march of Assumption, the capital. In the mean while the Paraguayans collected together a force of from five to six thousand armed men, and the hostile forces came in sight of each other at the village of Paraguany. A battle ensued, in which Be\n",

      "a vast river of South America, originating in those mountainous ranges which traverse the Brazilian provinces of Minas Geraes and Goyas. Like the Paraguay, it is formed of a great number of small streams, the sources of which extend over several degrees, probably from the sixteenth to the twentieth of south latitude. Before the Parana reaches the parallel of south latitude under which the Paraguay commences, it has drained an immense tract of country, and become swelled to a mighty stream. About this point, which is the verge of the great table-land which forms the inner part of Brazil, it tumbles over a precipitous rocky channel, at a place called Setequedas, or Seven Falls. Some have spoken of a continued rapid and broken advance of the river for several leagues; but Cazal, a high authority, represents it as here narrowed from a league in breadth to a hundred yards, by six small rocky islands, between which the water rushes, foams, and falls. But the hundred yards mentioned must refer only to the breadth of that part of the river which is wholly uninterrupted by the islands; between all of them various minor currents must of course flow, and these are certainly not included in the statement of the width of the Parana at this part. Azara describes these stupendous cataracts under another name. The first, called Sant de Canendigu, which was the name of a cacique who inhabited this part of the country at the time of the coñquest, and Sant de Guayra, from the vicinity of the province of that name, is situated not far from the tropic of Capricorn, in 24. 4. 27. of south latitude. It is a frightful cascade, and worthy of being described by the poets. Immediately before this immense river falls over the precipice, or rather inclined plane, it is suddenly contracted from above two hundred toises to about thirty toises in breadth, and descends into the frowning abyss with frightful fury, causing the solid earth to tremble around. The fall is not vertical, but at an angle of fifty degrees, the perpendicular descent being fifty-two French feet. The vapours which rise from the shock of the waters, and the pointed rocks situated in the channel of the precipice, are seen at the distance of many leagues, in the form of columns. Rainbows of the most lively colours, formed by the rays of the sun, appear suspended over the cataract; and in these a quivering movement may be perceived. The sound is heard at the distance of six leagues; and the clouds which are formed by the ascending vapours form an eternal rain in the vicinity. There are other cataracts either belonging to the Parana or its tributaries, but they are not of such magnitude as the Setequedas. The general bearing of the Parana, in by far the greater part of its course, is southerly. About the twentyseventh parallel it takes a westerly direction, in which it continues to flow until its junction with the Paraguay. Not far from the point where it takes a great bend from southwest to nearly due west, it meets with a rocky edge, over which it is precipitated at the island of Apipé, and here navigation for large vessels terminates. But when the waters are large, the passage is free for galliotes and small craft. Near this is the lake. Ibera or Ybyera, one of the most considerable in the country, and which, like the Xarayes of Paraguay, is said to be formed by the water of the upper part of the Parana. Azara, however, asserts that it has no connection with that river. It is thirty leagues in breadth at its northern extremity, where it is parallel with the Parana, and to which it is very near, though without having any visible communication with that river. Thirty leagues to the south, there is formed what has been called the Gorge of Yuquicua; after which it again enlarges in proportion as it advances southward, until it terminates by forming the river Miriñay, which is considerable, and flows into the Uruguay. From Yuquicua the lake Ybyera also stretches thirty leagues to the west, and there three rivers issue from it, called the Saint Lucie, the Corrientes, and the Bateles. It has no apparent source, receiving neither river nor rivulet, and continues during the year almost without any variation, being filled with aquatic plants, and even with some trees. A great part of it must therefore partake more of the character of a marsh than a lake; and it is to be observed that several recent authorities maintain that it is connected with the river Parana, and follows the rise and fall of its waters. “In the dry season,” says Luccock, “it covers an extent of about a hundred and fifty square leagues, and all around the land supplies an abundance of food for cattle; but about a month after the rains have commenced in the upper country, that is, in December, the Ybyera swells to a vast extent, covering hardly less than two thousand square leagues. At this period it is said to communicate both with the Parana and the Uruguay; a circumstance which, if correctly stated, indicates that these streams once united there, and that the lower grounds have been formed by their concurrent operation continued for ages.” Higher up on the same river, and in the midst of the woods, is another lake called the Jagape, but little more is known of it than its name, and that chiefly from the report of people dwelling in its neighbourhood, who occasionally find their way to Rio de Janeiro.\n",
      "After the confluence of the Parana and Paraguay, in latitude 27. 27., the river under the former name assumes a grand and majestic appearance. It is studded with innumerable islands, some of which are of considerable size, thickly clothed with trees and shrubs, and forming a refuge for foxes, tigers, and other wild animals. The volume of its waters is of course very great. It is above two miles in breadth, of considerable depth, and has a current more rapid than that of the Paraguay before its junction. “The Parana and Paraguay,” says Air Luccock, “rolling impetuously through a very extended course, bring down a great quantity of wreck, and soil of a reddish colour. When they have arrived at the more level grounds, and their currents are become comparatively slow, much of it is deposited; there it remains until the next wet season, when it is again urged onward by a resistless torrent, which not only sweeps the bottom, but frets and tears the banks, which had before been raised.” The main current is never less than two fathoms and a half in depth; and it is near the sides of the river, not in the centre, that the channel is deepest. Its periodical rise commences in December, which is some time after the commencement of the rainy season in the countries situated between the tropic of Capricorn and the equator; and it continues rising without interruption till the month of April, when decreasing till July, with somewhat more rapidity than it rose, it again shrinks within its legitimate bounds. In the latter month it is usual to perceive a slight rising, which the inhabitants of the country call “Èl repunte ;” and which is attributed to the waters which the river receives from the streams pouring down from the temperate zone, where the season of winter is almost always rainy. But the “repunte” is of such trivial moment that it never overflows the lands even in the lowest situations. The rains, although invariable as to their recurrence, are greater in some years than in others; and the height to which the river rises, of course, corresponds with the quantity of rain which falls. The navigation of this river is of considerable importance. “There are three causes which regularly impede the navigation of rivers,” says Don Ignacio Nuñez, in his work on the united provinces of the Rio de la Plata, “the great rapidity of their currents, the shallowness of their waters, and the shoals, rocks, or banks which obstruct their passage. None of these inconveniences are met with in the Parana, till reaching the island of Apipé. The rapidity of its course varies with the state of the river, and the conformation of its channel. When the rising is at its greatest height, the velocity of its current is greater than when it is on the decrease; and, in both seasons, it is always greatest in those parts where its channel is the narrowest. In the Rosario, in Punta Gorda, and in Hernan de Arias, which are the places where it is the most straitened in width, six observations made during the time of its rising gave for its average velocity a foot and a half per second. When the river is in its natural bed its stream has much less velocity, and that is not alike in all places in its breadth. In the centre of the channel it is greater than on the shore towards the bogs; and there, on account of its being very accessible, it is greater than in the places near the islands, where the velocity is almost null; which is not the case in the Rio de la Plata, in which the currents are invariably in proportion to, and in direction with, the winds which blow. It is therefore evident that the rapidity of the current of the Parana is no impediment to its navigation; which, indeed, experience has long since proved. As regards the depth, no person is ignorant of its capability for the navigation of vessels of all burdens as far as the island of Apipé; and it would continue with depth enough for that object for a great distance farther, did not a cataract situated in that place impede its progress.” He then goes on to state, that its depth at the shallowest is quite sufficient for very large vessels; and that the greater part of its sinuosities and arms are not only navigable in the rainy season, but even when the river is at the lowest. “From Cape Saint Maria to the island of Apipé,” he continues, “is a distance by water of five hundred leagues, navigable without any other reef than the English Bank (Banco Ingles), which will cease to be dangerous as soon as a vigilant and protecting government shall watch over the commerce and prosperity of the country.

But afterwards, when the sentiments of mankind became more corrupt, they began to form images, and to entertain the opinion, that by virtue of consecration, the gods were called down to inhabit or dwell in these statues.

      "a Greek term, literally signifying substance, or subsistence, and used in theology for person. The word is Greek, ⅛00τα07ς, compounded of υ ι ro, sub, under, and ίΰτημι, sto, existo, I stand, I exist; as if we were to say subsistentia. Thus we hold that there is but one nature or essence in God, but three hypostases or persons. The term hypostasis is of a very ancient standing in the church. St Cyril repeats it several times, as also the phrase “union according to hypostasis.” The first time it occurs is in a letter from that father to Nestorius, where he uses it instead of πξοϋωπον, the word we commonly render person, which did not seem expressive enough. “The philosophers,” says St Cyril, “have allowed three hypostases. They have extended the divinity to three hypostases; they have even sometimes used the word trinity ; and nothing was wanting but to have admitted the con substantiality of the three hypostases, to show the unity of the divine nature, exclusively of all triplicity in respect of distinction of nature, and not to hold it necessary to conceive any respective inferiority of hypostasesP\n",
      "This term occasioned great dissensions in the ancient church; first amongst the Greeks, and afterwards amongst the Latins. In the council of Nice, hypostasis was defined to denote the same thing with essence or substance; so that it was heresy to say that Jesus Christ was of a different hypostasis from the Father; but custom altered the meaning of the term. In the necessity they were under of expressing themselves strongly against the Sabellians, the Greeks made choice of the word hypostasis, and the Latins of the word persona ; a change which proved the occasion of endless disagreement. The phrase rguς o¶o- ΰταΰίΐς, used by the Greeks, scandalized the Latins, whose usual way of rendering ύποΰταΰις in their language was by substantia. The barrenness of the Latin tongue in theological phrases allowed them but one word for the two Greek ones, òuď/aand υττοΰταας, and thus disabled them from distinguishing essence and hypostasis; for which reason they chose rather to use the term tres personae, and tres hypostases. But an end was put to disputation, in a synod held at Alexandria about the year 362, at which St Athanasius assisted; and from this time the Latins made no great scruple of saying tres hypostases, nor the Greeks of saying three persons. \t\t a sect of heretics in the fourth century, who were so called from the profession they made of worshipping the Most High God.\n",

      "an ancient Latin writer, who flourished in the time of Augustus. Suetonius, in his work De Illustribus Grammaticis, says that he was by birth a Spaniard; but some think that he was a native of Alexandria in Egypt. He was originally a slave of Julius Caesar, who brought him to Rome; but having distinguished himself by his literary acquirements, he was emancipated by Augustus, and placed at the head of the library which that sovereign had founded in the temple of the Palatine Apollo. Whilst in this situation, he became intimate with Ovid the poet; and Caius Licinius, a man of consular rank, has informed us that he died very poor, having been supported by the bounty of his friends; but some think that Caius Licinius is a mistake for Caius Asinius, who wrote a history of the civil war, and served as consul with Cneius Domitius Calvinus, in the year of the city 723. It is doubtful whether the works which have been preserved under his name are really the productions of the freedman of Augustus. These are Fabularum Liber, a collection of two hundred and seventy-seven fables, principally derived from Greek sources, and which are of great value in mythological inquiries; and Poeticon Astronomicon, an astronomical and mathematical work in prose. He is also supposed to have written on the subject of agriculture, and to have composed a book of Genealogies, of which mention is made in the Poeticon Astronomicon. Of this last work, the first book treats of the world and the doctrine of the sphere, and the second of the signs in the zodiac; the third contains a history and description of the constellations, and the fourth treats of the several things relating to the planets. But whilst Hyginus describes the constellations in the heavens, and enumerates the stars belonging to each, he takes occasion to explain the fables of the poets from which these constellations were supposed to have originally derived their names, and it is probably owing to this circumstance that the work has been denominated Poeticon Astronomicon. It has however come down to us in a very imperfect state; and all that part of it which treated of the month, the year, and the reasons for intercalating the months, has been entirely lost. To the Poeticon Astronomicon is usually appended a book of fables, containing a compendium of the heathen mythology; but this is also imperfect, and is moreover suspected to be spurious. Υ ∖∖ c Liber Fabularum and the Poeticon Astronornicon have been published together at Basle, 1555, and at Hamburg, 1674; and separately at Paris, 1578, and at Leyden, 1670. The best editions are those which appeared with the commentary of Muncker, in a collection entitled MythographiLatini, Amsterdam, 1681, reprinted with new notes by Van Staveren, Leyden, 1763. There are other works under the name of Hyginus, but they all belong to a later age: De Limitibus constituendis, published in a collection entitled PeiAgrariae Auctores, cura Goesii, Amsterdam, 1674; a Fragment on the proper mode of pitching a camp, published firstby Scriverius, along with Vegetius, Leyden, 1607, and reprinted with a learned commentary by Schelius, Amsterdam, 1661, and also by Graevius in his Thesaurus. Angelo Maio, the learned librarian of the Vatican, has added three new works on mythology to those which we already possessed, and one of these is under the name of Hyginus, but evidently by a writer of the fifth century. Other manuscripts of the same works have since been discovered at Göttingen, Gothe, and Paris; and Dr Bode has published a new edition, with a careful collation of these manuscripts, Scriptores Perurn Mythicarum Latini tres Pomae nuper reperti, Celle, 1834. For the life of Hyginus, freedman of Augustus, consult Scheffer, De Hygini Script. Fαbιιl. oetate atque stylo ; and Muncker, De αuctore, stylo, ct atate Mythologue quce C. Hygini nomen pr<rfert.\n",
      " \t\t a learned and beautiful lady of antiquity, the daughter of Theon, a celebrated philosopher and mathematician, and president of the Alexandrian school, was born at Alexandria about the end of the fourth century. Her father, encouraged by her extraordinary genius, had her not only educated in all the ordinary accomplishments of her sex, but instructed in the most abstruse sciences. In philosophy, geometry, and astronomy she made such progress, that she was justly accounted the most learned person of her time. At length she was thought worthy to succeed her father in the government of the school of Alexandria, and to teach from that chair where Ammonius, Hierocles, and many other great men, had taught before; and this at a time too when men of great learning abounded both at Alexandria and in many other parts of the Roman empire. Her fame was so extensive, and her worth so universally acknowledged, that her prelections were attended by a crowded auditory. One cannot represent to himself, without pleasure, the flower of all the youth of Europe, Asia, and Africa, sitting at the feet of a very beautiful woman (for such we are assured Hypatia was), all greedily imbibing instruction from her mouth, and many of them, doubtless, love from her eyes; though we are not sure that she ever listened to any solicitations, since Suidas, who talks of her marriage with Isiodorus, at the same time relates, not very consistently, that she died a maid.\n",
      "Her scholars were as eminent as they were numerous. One of them was the celebrated Synesius, who afterwards became bishop of Ptolemais. This ancient Christian Platonist everywhere bears the strongest as well as the most grateful testimony to the virtue of his tutoress; and never mentions her without the most profound respect, and sometimes in terms of affection little short of adoration. But it was not Synesius and the disciples of the Alexandrian school alone who admired Hypatia for her virtue and learning. Never was woman more caressed by the public, and yet never woman maintained a more unspotted character. She was held as an oracle for her wisdom, which made her be consulted by the magistrates in all important cases; and this frequently drew her into the greatest intercourse with men, without the least censure of her manners. In a word, when Nicephorus intended to pay the highest compliment to the Princess Eudocia, he thought he could not do it better than by calling her another Hypatia.\n",
      "Whilst Hypatia thus reigned as the brightest ornament of Alexandria, Orestes governed the same place for the Emperor Theodosius, and Cyril was bishop or patriarch. Orestes having received a liberal education, could not but admire Hypatia; and, as a wise governor, he frequently consulted her. But this, together with an aversion which Cyril entertained to Orestes, proved fatal to the lady. One day about five hundred monks having assembled, attacked the governor, and would have killed him, had he not been rescued by the townsmen; and the respect which Orestes entertained for Hypatia causing her to be traduced amongst the Christian multitude, they dragged her from her chair, tore her in pieces, and burned her limbs. Cyril is more than suspected of having fomented this tragedy. Cave indeed endeavours to remove from the patriarch the imputation of so horrid an action, and lays it upon the Alexandrian mob in general, whom he calls levissimum hominum genus, a very fickle, inconstant race. But though Cyril should be allowed to have been neither the perpetrator, nor even the contriver, of the murder, yet it is strongly suspected that he did not discountenance it in the manner he ought to have done; and this suspicion is greatly confirmed by reflecting that he was so far from blaming the outrage committed by the monks upon Orestes, that he afterwards received the dead body of Ammonius, one of the most forward in that outrage, who had grievously wounded the governor, and who was justly punished with death. \t\t Score: 0.5723\n",

Of these, some held that there was only one life, which they called a plastic nature, presiding regularly and invariably over the whole corporeal universe, represented by them as a kind of large plant or vegetable. These were called the cosmoplastic and stoical atheists, because the Stoics believed such a nature, though many of them supposed it to be the instrument of the Deity. But others thought that every particle of matter was endowed with life, and represented the mundane system as depending upon a certain mixture of chance and plastic or orderly nature united together. These were called the Strato-ηιci, from Strato Lampsacenus, a disciple of Theophrastus, called also Physicus (Cicero Be Nat. Dear. lib. i. cap. 1 3), who was first a celebrated Peripatetic, and afterwards formed this new system of atheism for himself. Besides these two forms of atheism, some of the ancient philosophers were Hylopathians, or Anaximandrians, deriving all things from dead and stupid matter, in the way of qualities and forms, generative and corruptible; and others again adopted the atomical or Democritical system, by which the production of the universe is ascribed to atoms and figures. \t\t a Greek term, literally signifying substance, or subsistence, and used in theology for person.

      "an ancient Latin writer, who flourished in the time of Augustus. Suetonius, in his work De Illustribus Grammaticis, says that he was by birth a Spaniard; but some think that he was a native of Alexandria in Egypt. He was originally a slave of Julius Caesar, who brought him to Rome; but having distinguished himself by his literary acquirements, he was emancipated by Augustus, and placed at the head of the library which that sovereign had founded in the temple of the Palatine Apollo. Whilst in this situation, he became intimate with Ovid the poet; and Caius Licinius, a man of consular rank, has informed us that he died very poor, having been supported by the bounty of his friends; but some think that Caius Licinius is a mistake for Caius Asinius, who wrote a history of the civil war, and served as consul with Cneius Domitius Calvinus, in the year of the city 723. It is doubtful whether the works which have been preserved under his name are really the productions of the freedman of Augustus. These are Fabularum Liber, a collection of two hundred and seventy-seven fables, principally derived from Greek sources, and which are of great value in mythological inquiries; and Poeticon Astronomicon, an astronomical and mathematical work in prose. He is also supposed to have written on the subject of agriculture, and to have composed a book of Genealogies, of which mention is made in the Poeticon Astronomicon. Of this last work, the first book treats of the world and the doctrine of the sphere, and the second of the signs in the zodiac; the third contains a history and description of the constellations, and the fourth treats of the several things relating to the planets. But whilst Hyginus describes the constellations in the heavens, and enumerates the stars belonging to each, he takes occasion to explain the fables of the poets from which these constellations were supposed to have originally derived their names, and it is probably owing to this circumstance that the work has been denominated Poeticon Astronomicon. It has however come down to us in a very imperfect state; and all that part of it which treated of the month, the year, and the reasons for intercalating the months, has been entirely lost. To the Poeticon Astronomicon is usually appended a book of fables, containing a compendium of the heathen mythology; but this is also imperfect, and is moreover suspected to be spurious. Υ ∖∖ c Liber Fabularum and the Poeticon Astronornicon have been published together at Basle, 1555, and at Hamburg, 1674; and separately at Paris, 1578, and at Leyden, 1670. The best editions are those which appeared with the commentary of Muncker, in a collection entitled MythographiLatini, Amsterdam, 1681, reprinted with new notes by Van Staveren, Leyden, 1763. There are other works under the name of Hyginus, but they all belong to a later age: De Limitibus constituendis, published in a collection entitled PeiAgrariae Auctores, cura Goesii, Amsterdam, 1674; a Fragment on the proper mode of pitching a camp, published firstby Scriverius, along with Vegetius, Leyden, 1607, and reprinted with a learned commentary by Schelius, Amsterdam, 1661, and also by Graevius in his Thesaurus. Angelo Maio, the learned librarian of the Vatican, has added three new works on mythology to those which we already possessed, and one of these is under the name of Hyginus, but evidently by a writer of the fifth century. Other manuscripts of the same works have since been discovered at Göttingen, Gothe, and Paris; and Dr Bode has published a new edition, with a careful collation of these manuscripts, Scriptores Perurn Mythicarum Latini tres Pomae nuper reperti, Celle, 1834.

These were called the cosmoplastic and stoical atheists, because the Stoics believed such a nature, though many of them supposed it to be the instrument of the Deity. But others thought that every particle of matter was endowed with life, and represented the mundane system as depending upon a certain mixture of chance and plastic or orderly nature united together. These were called the Strato-ηιci, from Strato Lampsacenus, a disciple of Theophrastus, called also Physicus (Cicero Be Nat. Dear. lib. i. cap. 1 3), who was first a celebrated Peripatetic, and afterwards formed this new system of atheism for himself. Besides these two forms of atheism, some of the ancient philosophers were Hylopathians, or Anaximandrians, deriving all things from dead and stupid matter, in the way of qualities and forms, generative and corruptible; and others again adopted the atomical or Democritical system, by which the production of the universe is ascribed to atoms and figures. \t\t a sect of heretics in the fourth century, who were so called from the profession they made of worshipping the Most High God.\n",
      "The doctrine of the Hypsistarians may be considered as an assemblage of Paganism, Judaism, and Christianity. They adored the Most High God with the Christians; but they also revered fire and lamps with the heathens, and observed the sabbath, and the distinction of clean and unclean things with the Jews.\n",
      "The Hypsistarii bore a near resemblance to the Euchites, or Massalians. \t\t Score: 0.5167\n",

      "a song or ode in honour of God, or a poem, proper to be sung, composed in honour of some deity. The word is Greek, ú/xvo¢, hymn, formed from the verb io«, celebro, I celebrate. Isidore remarks on this word, that hymn is properly a song of joy, full of the praises of God, by which, according to him, it is distinguished from threna, which is a mourning song, full of lamentation.\n",
      "St Hilary, bishop of Poictiers, is said to have been the first who composed hymns to be sung in churches; and he was followed by St Ambrose. Most of those contained in the Roman breviary were composed by Prudentius. They have been translated into French verse by Messieurs de Port-Royal. In the Greek liturgy there are four kinds of hymns; but the word is not employed in the sense of a praise offered in verse, but simply of a laud or praise. The angelic hymn, or Gloria in excelsis, is of the first kind; the trisagion is of the second; the Cherubic hymn is of the third; and the hymn of victory and triumph, called ⅛∕wx∕oς, the last.\n",
      "The hymns or odes of the ancients generally consisted of three sorts of stanzas; one of which, called strophe, was sung by the band as they walked from east to west; another, called antistrophe, was performed as they returned from west to east; and the third part, or epode, was sung before the altar. The Jewish hymns were accompanied with trumpets, drums, and cymbals, to assist the voices of the Levites and the people. \t\t in Antiquity, a partition under the pulpit or logeum of the Greek theatre, appointed for the music. \t\t Score: 0.5122\n",

      "Idleness in any person whatsoever is a high offence against the public economy. In China it is a maxim, that if there be a man who does not work, or a woman that is idle, in the empire, somebody mu 1 ,i suffer cold or hunger upon that account, the produce of the lands not being more than sufficient, with culture, to maintain the inhabitants; and therefore, though the idle person may shift off the want from himself, yet it must in the end fall somewhere. The court of Areopagus at Athens likewise punished idleness, and exerted a right of examining every citizen as to the manner in which he spent his time; the intention of this being, that the Athenians, knowing they were to give an account of their occupations, should follow only such as were laudable, and that there might be no room left for those who lived by unlawful arts. The civil law expelled all sturdy vagrant from the city; and, in the English law, all idle persons or vagabonds, whom our ancient statutes describe to be “such as wake on the night and sleep on the day, and haunt customable taverns and ale-houses, and routs about; and no man wot from whence they come, ne whether they go ;” or such as are more particularly described by the statute 17 Geo. II. c. 5, and divided into three classes, namely, idle and disorderly persons, rogues and vagabonds, and incorrigible rogues; all these are offenders against the good order, and blemishes in the government, of any kingdom. They are therefore all punishable by the statute last mentioned; idle and disorderly persons with one month’s imprisonment in the house of correction; rogues and vagabonds w>ith whipping, and imprisonment not exceeding six months; and incorrigible rogues with the like discipline, and confinement not exceeding two years. Persons harbouring vagrants are liable to a fine of forty shillings, and to pay all expenses brought upon the parish thereby; in the same manner as, by our ancient laws, whoever harboured any stranger for more than two nights, was answerable to the public for any offence that might be committed by his inmate. \t\t a species of punishment amongst the Romans, by which the offender suffered public shame, either by virtue of the praetor’s edict, or by order of the censor. This punishment, besides the disgrace, deprived the party of the privilege of bearing any offices, and of almost all the other rights of a Roman citizen. \t\t Score: 0.5112\n",
