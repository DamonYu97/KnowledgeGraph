The old town lies about a mile to the north of the new, at the mouth of the river Don, over which is a fine bridge, of a single arch, which rests at both sides on two rocks. The old town was formerly the seat of the bishop, and had a large cathedral church, commonly called St Macher's. This cathedral had anciently two rows of stone pillars across the church, and three turrets; the steeple, which was the largest of these turrets, rested upon an arch, supported by four pillars. In this cathedral there was a fine library; but about the year 1560 it was almost totally destroyed. But the capital building is the King's-college, on the south side of the town, which is alarge and stately fabric. The steeple is vaulted with a double cross arch, above which is an imperial crown, supported by eighstone pillars, and closed with a globe and two gilded crosses. In the year 1631 this steeple was thrown down by a storm, but was soon after rebuilt in a more stately form. This college was founded by Bishop Elainston in the year 1500; but James IV. claimed the patronage of it, and it has since been caled King's Fellege. This college, and the Marishall-college in the new town, form one university, called the University of King Charles. The new town is the capital of the shire of Aberdeen. For largeness, trade and beauty, it greatly exceeds any town in the North. It stands upon a hill or rising ground. the buildings are generally four stories high, and have, for the most part, gardens behind them, which gives it a beautiful appearance. On the high street is a large church, which formerly belonged to the Franciscans. This church was begun by Bp William Elphinston, and finished by Gavinus Dunbar, Bishop of Aberdeen, about the 1500. Bp Dunbar is said likewise to have built the bridge over the Dee, which consists of seven arches. The chief public building in the new town is the Marishall-college, founded by George Keith Earl of Marshall, in the year 1593; but has since been greatly augmented with additional buildings.

The old town lies awont a mile to the north of the new, at the mouth of the river Don, over which is a . ■fine bridge, of a Angle arch, which rests at both sides on two rocks. The old tov/n was formerly the seat of the biihop, and had a large cathedral church, commonly called St Macher's. This cathedral had an. ciently two rows of Hone pillars across .the church, and three turrets ; the steeple, which was the largest of these turrets, felled upon an arch, supported by four pillars. In this cathedral there was a fine library; but about the year 1560 it was almost totally delboyed But the capital building is the King’s-college, on the south side of the town, which is a large and (lately fabric. The fteeplc is vaulted with a double cross arch, above which is an imperial crown, supported by eight stone pillars, and closed with a globe and two gilded crolfes. In the year 1631 this steeple was thrown down by a storm, but was (bon after rebuilt in a more (lately form. This college was founded by Bishop El • phindpn in the year 1500; but James IV. claimed the patronage of it, and it has since been called the King's Colldge. This college, and the M.arifiiall-college in the new town, form-one university, called the Univer Jity of King Charles. The new town is the capital of the (hire of Aberdeen. For largeness, trade, and beauty, it greatly exceeds any town in the North. It (lands upon a hill or rising ground. The buildings are generally four (lories high, and have, for the mod part, gardens behind them, which gives it a beautiful appearance. On tire high dreet is a large church, which formerly belonged to the Franciscans. This church was begun by Bp William Elphindon, and finished by Gavinus Dunbar, Bidiop of Aberdeen, about the 1500. Bp Dunbar is said likewise to have built the bridge over the Dee, which Confids of seven arches.. The chief public building in the new town is the Maridrall-college, founded by George Keith Earl of Mar (hall, in the year 1593; but has since been greatly augmented with additional buildings.

This talent is peculiarly necessary in the present state of literature ; for many writers have acquired the dexterity of spreading a few tritical thoughts over several hundred pages. When an author hits upon a thought that nleases him, he is apt to dwell upon it, to view it in different lights, to force it in improperly, or upon the slightest relations. Though this may be pleasant to the writer, it tires and vexes the reader. There is another great source of diffusion in composition. It is a capital object with an author, whatever be the subject, to give vent to all his best thoughts. When he finds a proper palce for any of them, he is eculiarly happy. But,  rather than sacrifice a thought ta in sad of he ferves it in by thery of diprertses or superfluous illustration. If none of these expedients answer his purpose , he has recourse to the marin, a very convenient apartment for all manner of pedantry and impertinence. There is not an author, however correct, but is more or less faulty in this respect. An abridger, however, is not subject to these temptations. The thoughts are not his own ; he views them in a cooler and less affectionate manner ; he discovers an impropriety in some, a vanity in others, and a want of utility in many. His business, therefore, is to retrench superfluities, digressions, quotations, pedantry, etc. and to lay before the public only what is really useful. This is by no means an easy employment : To abridge some books, requires talents equal, if not superior, to those of the author. The facts, manner, spirit, and reasoning, must be preserved ; nothing essential, wither in argument or illustration, ought to be omitted. The difficulty of the task is the principal reason why we have so few good abridgements : Wynne\\'s abridgement of Locke\\'s Essay on the Human Understanding is, perhaps, the only unexceptionable one in our language.

It would be foreign to our plan to give examples of abridgements for the public : But, as it may be useful, especially to young people, to know how to abridge books for their own use, after giving a few directions, we shall exhibit and example or two, to shew with what ease it may be done .\" Read the book carefully ; endeavour to learn the principal view of the author ; attend to the arguments employed : When you have done so, you will generally find, that what the author uses as new or additional arguments, are in reality only collateral ones, or extensions of the principal argument. Take a piece of paper, or a common-place book, put down what the author wants to prove, subjoin the argument or arguments, and you have the substance of the book in a few lines. For example, In the Essay of Miracles, Mr Hume\\'s design is to prove, That miracles which have not been the immeliate objects of our senses, cannot reasonably be believed upon the testimony of others. Now, his argument, (for there happens to be but is, That experience, which in some things is vari\" able, in others uniform, is our only guide in rea\" oning concerning matters of fact. A variable ex\" perience gives rise to probability only ; an uniform \" experience amounts to a proof. Our belief of any \" fact from the testimony of eye-witnesses, is deri\" ved from no other principle than our experience \" in the veracity of human testimony. If the fact \" attested be miraculous, here arises a contest of \" two opposite experiences, or proof against proof. \". Now, a miracle is a violation of the laws of na\" ture ; and as a firm and unalterab;e experience has \" established these laws, the proof against a miracle, \" from the very nature of the fact, is as complete as \" any argument from experience can possibly be imagined; and if so, it is an undeniable consequence, \" that it cannot be surmounted by any proof what\" ever derived from human testimony. In Dr campbell\\'s Dissertation on Miracles, the author\\'s principl aim is to shew the fallacy of Mr Hume\\'s argument ; which he has done most successfully by another single argument, as follows : The evidence arising from human testimony is \" not solely derived from experience : on the contra\" ry, testimony hath a natural influence on belief an\" tecedent to experience. The early and unlimit\" ed assent given to testimony by children gradually \" contracts as they advance in life : it is, therefore, \"\" more consonant to truth, to say, that our dissidence \" in testimony is the result of experience, than that \" our faith in it has foundation. Besides, the \" uniformity of experience, in favour of any fact, is \" not a proof against its being reversed in a particular \" instance. The evidence arising from the single te\" stimony of a man of known veracity will go far to \" establish a belief in its being actually reversed  :If \" his testimony be confirmed by a few others of the \" same character, we cannot with-hold our assent to \" the truth of it. Now, though the operations of na\" ture are governed by uniform laws, and though wo \" have not the testimony of our senses in favour of a\" ny violation of them, still, if, in particular instan\" ces, we have the testimony of thousands of our fel\" low-creatures, and those too men of strict intenri. \" ty, swayed by no motives of ambition or interest, \" and governed by the principles of common sense, \" That they were actually  eye-witnesses of these vio\" lations, and the constitution of our nature obliges us to w. bisie theits. These two examples contain the substance of about t0o nages. — Making private abridgements of this kind has many advantages ; it engages us to read with accuracy and attention ; it fixes the subject in out minds ; and, if we should happen to forget, instead of reading the books again, by glancing a few lines, ve are not only in possession of the chief arguments, but recall in a good measure the author\\'s method and manner. Abridging is peculiarly useful in taking the sub stance of what is delivered by Professors, &c.

According to this regulation, the academy was to be composed of ten honorary academicians, eight strangers associates, twenty pensionaries sellows, twenty eleves or scholars, and twelve French associates ; these were to be divided into six classes, viz. geometricians, astronomers, mechanics, anatomists, chemists, and botanists; the honorary academists to be all inhabitants of France, the pensionaries and eleves all to reside at Paris.

The principal fubjedt is thus kept out of view, and we are left to discover it by refiedtion. In other words, an allegory is, in every refpedt, fimilarto an hicroglyphical painting, excepting only that words are used instead of colours. Their effedts are precisely the same : An Hieroglyphic taifes two images in the mind; one seen, that represents one that is not seen : An allegory does the same; the representative fubjedt is described; and the resemblance leads us to apply the description to the fubjedt represented. . There cannot be a finer or-more corredt allegory than the following, in which a vineyard is made to re ptefent God’s own people the Jews “ Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou “ hast cart' out the heathen, and planted it. Thou “ didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the “ land. The hills were covered with its ftiadow, and “ the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. “ Why hart thou then broken down her hedges, so “ that all that pass do pluck her ? The boar out of V the wood doth waste it, and the wild heart doth de“ vour it. Return, we beseech thee, O God of horts: “ Jook down from heaven, and behold, and visit this “ vine and the vineyard thy right hand hath planted, “ and the branch thou madeft strong for thyself.” Nothing gives greater pleasure than an allegory, •when the representative fubjed bears a strong analogy, in all its circumstances, to that which is represented. But moll writers are unlucky in their choice, the analogy being generally so saint and obscure, as rather to puzzle than to please. Allegories, as well as metaphors and fimilies, are unnatural in exprefling any severe palfion which totally occupies the mind. For this reason, the following speech of Macbeth is julily condemned by the learned author of the Elements of Methought I hea/d a voice cry, Sleep no more !

The head of the amphilbaena is small, smooth, and blunt; the nostrils are very small; the eyes are minute and blackiffi ; and the mouth is furnifted with a great number of small teeth. The body is cylindrical, about a foot long, and divided iiito about 200 annular convex fegments like those of a worm ; and it has about 40 longitudinal streaks, of which 12 on each side are in the form of small crosses like the Roman X; the anus is a transverse slit; and the last ring or segment of the belly has eight small papilla?, forming a transverse line before the anus; the tail, i. e. all the space below the anus, is ffiort, consisting of thirty annular fegments, without being marked with the cross-lines, and is thick and blunt at the point. The colour of the whole animal is black, variegated with white; but the black prevails most on the back, and the white on the belly. It has a great resemblance to a worm, living in the earth, and movin' * equally well with either end foremost. There are but two species, viz. 1. the fuliginofa, which answers exaftly to the above defeription, and is found dn Lybia, and in different parts of America. 2. The riba, which is totally white, is a native of both the Indies, and is generally found in ant-hillocks. The bite of the amphiffisena is reckoned to be mortal by many authors; but as it is not furniffied with dogfangs, the usual instruments of cpnveying the poison of serpents, later writers esteem it not to be poisonous. They feed upon ants and earth-worms, but particularly the latter.

XIV. Of the GENESIS and RESOLUTION of EQUATIONS in general ; and the number of Roots an Equation of any Degree may heve. AFTER the same manner, as the higher powers are roduced by the multiplication of the lower powers of the same root, eqnations of superior orders are generated by the multiplication of equations of inferior orders involving the same unknown quantity. And \" an equa\" tion of any dimension may be considered as prodaced \" by the mulriplication of as many simple equations as \" it has dimersions, or of any orher equations what\" soever, if the sum of their dimensions is equal to the \" dimension of that equation. Thus, any cubic equaFor extracting the higher roots of a binomial, whose tion may be conceived as generated by the multiplication. of three simple equations, or of one qundratic and one simple equation. A biqnacrutic is generated by the nultiplication of four simple equations, or of twwo quadratic equations, or, lastly, of one cubic and one simple equation. If the equations which yuu suppose multiplied by one \" of is divisible by AA--BB, the quotient being Q. another are the same, then the equation generated will be nothing else but some power of those equations, and the operation is mergly involuti-n; of which we have \" number, which suppose to be r. Divide AO by treated already ; ane, when any such equation is given, \" its greatest rational divifor, and let the quotient tes, the simple equation by whose multiplication it is produ\" and let ÆKE. in the nearest integer number, be ced is found by evolution, or the extraction of a root. But when the equations that are supposed to be multiplied by each other are different, then other equations. than powers are generated; which to resolve into the simple equations whence they are generated is a different operation from involution, and is what is called, the resolution of equations. But as evolution is performed by observing and tracing back the steps of involution ; so to discover the rules for the resolution of equations, we must carefully observe their generation. Suppose the unknown quantity to be 2, and its values in any simple equations to be a, b, e, d, &c. then those simple equations, by bringing all the terms to one side, become X--azto, N--bano, &eno, &c. And, the product of any two of these, as x--axx-lco will give a quadratic equation, or an equation of two dimeasions. the product of any three of them, as 2--4 XK-UXN--C2O, will give a cubic equation, or one of three dimensions. the product of any four of them will give a biguadratic equation, or one of four dimensions, as N-ANK-ENK-CNN-dæO. And, in general, \" in the equation produced, the highest dimension of \" the unknown quantity will be equal to the number \" of simple equations that are multiplied by each ots thers. When any equation, equivalent to this biquadratic K-MOXK-EXK--CXK-d2O, is proposed to be resolved, the whole difficulty consists in finding the simples equations K--4 20, K---FanO, N-- C2O, &-d a0, by whose multiplication it is produced ; for each of these simple equations gives one of the values of x, and one soution of the proposed equation. For, if any of the values of x, deduced from those simple equations, be substiuted in the proposed equation in place of X, then all the terms of that equation will vanish, and the whole be found equal to nothing. Because, when it is supposed that xca, or xazb, or xaze, or xaxnd, then the product N--ANY-UXK-CXX--d does vanish, because one of the factors is equal to nothing. There are therefore four suppositions that give K--AXX-BXX-CXX-o eso according to the proposed equation ; that is, there are four roots of the proposed equation. And after the same manner, \" any other equation admits of as many \" solutions as there are simple equations multiplied by \" one another that produce it, or, as many as there are \" units in the highest dimension of the unknown quanti\" ty in the proposed equation\" But as there are no other quantities whatsoever besides these four Je. b, e, 4 that substituted in the product Y-K- AXK-EMK-ENN---A, in the place of a, vill make the product vanish ; therefore the equation. N--ANK-BXY-CXY--dæO, cannot possibly have more than these four roots, and cannot admit of more solutions than four. If yon substitute in that product a quantity neither equal to a, nor 6, nor e, nor d, which suppose e then since neither e-a, e--h, r-ce, nor e-d is equal to nothing; their product e--4XK-EXE--CXC-d cannot be equal to nothing, but must be some real product; and therefore there is no supposition beside one of the foresaid four that gives a just IO1 value of a according to the proposed equation. S that it can have no more than these four roots. And after the same manner it appears, that \" no equation can \" have more roots than it contains dimensions of the un\" known quantity\" To make all this still plainer by an example, in numbers ; suppose the equation to be resolved, to be N. IOxl T. 35N --- 5ON-T2G2O, and that you discover that this equation is the same with the product of K--IXX---3X K- 3XN---4, then you certainly infer that the four values of x are 1, 2, 3, 4; seeing any of these numbers placed for x makes that iduct, and consequently 2tIOxl-P35N\\'--5ON-L24, equal to nothing, according to te proposed equation. And it is certain that there can be no other values of a besides these four : since when you substitute any other number for x in those factors A---I, 2-z, &-3, a--4, none of the factors vanish ; and therefore their product cannot be equal to nothing, according to the equation. It may be useful sometimes to consider equations as generated from others of an inferior fort besides simple ones. Thus a cubie equation may be conceived as generated from the quadr tie N-pN-Towo, and the simple equation 2--rmo, multiplied by each other ; whose product Nl --pN\\'  gy--- n8 )2n0 may express any cubic eANY apx. quation whose roots are the quantity Ia) the value of x in the simple equation, and the two roots of the quadratic equation, viz. CEX CE and CadEEs, as appears from Chap. 12. And, according as these roots are real or impossible, two of the roots of the cubicequation are real or impossible. In the doctrine of involution, we shewed, that \" the \" square of any quantity, positive or negative, is always \" positive; and therefore \" the square root of a nega\" tive is impossible or imaginary. For example, the oal is either -Fa, or --a; but of --alcan neither be Ta nor a, but must be imaginaty. Hence is understood, that \" a quadratic equation may have no impossible \" expression in its coefsicients ; and yet, when it is re\" solved into the simole equations that produce it, they \" may involve impossible expressions. Thus, the quadratic equation æl-batmo has no impossible coefsicient ; but the simple equations from which it is produced, viz. N-Lof --amo, and K--W--alwo, both involve an imaginary quantity; as the square ---at is a real quantity, but its square root is imaginary. After the same manner, a biquadratic equation, when resolved, may give four simple equations, each of which may give an impossible value for the root : and the same may be said of any equation that can be prodoced from quadratic equations only, that is, whose dimensions are of the even mumbers. But, \" a cubic equation swhich cannot be generated \" from quadratic equations only, but requires one sim\" ple equation besides to produce ity if none of its coef\" ficients are impossible, will have, at least, one real \" root the same with the root of the simple equation Se whence i cy. whence it is produced. The square of an impossible quantity may be real, as the square of of al is 41; but \" the cube of an impossible quantity is still impossi\" ble as it still involves the square root of a negative: as, of -al X o-asxof--al wo-ab aealof--T, is plainly imaginary. From which it appears, that though two simple equations involving impossible expressions, multiplied by one another, may give a product where ne impelsible expression may appear ; yet \" if three such simple equations be multiplied by each other, the im\" possible expression will not disappear in their product. And hence it is plain, that though a quadratic equation. whose coefsicients are all real may have its two roots impossible, yet \" a cubic equation whose coefsicients are real cannot have all its three roots impossible. In general, it appears, that the impossible expressions cannot disappear in the equation produced, but when their number is even ; that there are never in any equations, whose coessicients are real quantities, single impossble roots, or an odd number of impossible roots, but \" that the roots become impossible in pairs, and that \" an equation of an odd number of dimensions has always one real root.\" \" The roots of equations are either positive or negative, \" according as the roots of the simpse equations whence \" they are praduced are positive or negative. If you suppose K--w, Nb, NC, 2d, &c. then shall NPao, æThazo, æreao, x-hdmo; and the equation. N-TANN-TEXY -FeXN-Td2O will have its roots, ra, ---b, c, -od, &c. negative. But to know when the roots of equations are positive, and when negative, and how many there are of each kind, shall be explained in the next chapter. CHAP. XV. Of the SIONS and COEEEICIENTS of Equat ons. WHEN any number of simple equations are multiplied by cach other, it is obvious that the highest dimension of the unknown quantity in their product is equal to the number of those simple equations; and the term involving the highest dimension is called the sinst term of the equasion generated by this multiplication. The term involving the next dimension of the unknown quantity, less than the greatest by un\\'s is called the sicond term of the equation ; the term involving the next dimension of the unknown quantity, which is less than the greatest by two, the third term of the equation, etc. ; and that term which involves no dimension of the unknown quantity, but is some known quantity, is called the last term of the equation. The number of terms is always greater than the \" highest dimension of the unknown quantity by unit o, And when any term is wanting, an asterisk is marked in its place. the signs and coefsicients of equations will be understood by considering the following table, where the simple equations K-a 2-8, &c. are multiplied by one another, and produce successively the higher equations. Biuns. Be-rab 520, a quadratic. cies. 3l. xKLLacy NK-abezo, a cubic. The ) e) Nr dtco cier ilg o iust The ; Thd 1 IedJ. Abrites thes eNT-Tadl Pae The Tha Lhe Fee. pdel cids. athe 1 acdl ade ) Nellorne;. beal. -hee p -bdel edeA &c. ta sursolid ) From the inspection of these equations it is plain, that the coefficient of the first term is unit. The coefsicient of the second term is the sum of all the roots ta, b, cy d, e laving their signs changed. The coefficient of the third term is the sum of all the pbroducts that can be made by muttipying any twoo of the roots ta, b, e d. ea) by one another. The coefficient of the fourth term is the sum of all the products that can be made by multiglying ints one another any three of the reots, with their signs changed. And after the same manner all the other coefficients are formed. The last term is always the product of all the roots having their signs changed, multiplied by one another. Although in the table such simple equations only are multiplied by one another as have positive roots, it is ealy to see, that : the coefsicients will be formed according to the same rule when any of the simple equa\" tions have negative roots. And, in general, if Npy\\'-ToN-rwo represent any cubic equation, then shall 9 be the sum of the roots ; 9 the sum of the products made by multiplying any two of them ; r the product of all the three: and, if -P. Te. T. Ts. T, Tu, &c. be the coefsicients of the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, &c. terms of any equation, then shall g be the sum of all the roots, 9 the sum of the products of any two, r the sumof the products of any three, 1 the sum of the products. of any four, 1 the sum of the products of any sive, n the sum of the products of any six, &c. When L. When therefore any equation is proposed to be resolved, it is easy to find the sum of the roots, (for it is equal to the coefsicient of the second term having its sign changed) ; or to find the sum of the products that canbe made by multiplying any determinate number of them. But it is also easy \" to find the sum of the squares, or \" of any powers, of the roots. The sum of the squares is always pl--2g. For calling the sum of the squares A, since the sum of the roots is p; and \" the square of the sum of any quantities is always equal to the sum of their squares added to \" double the products that can be made by multiplying \" any two of them, therefore pIzst-r2y, and consequently Bap\\' --2g. For example, a-Th-ro\\'mat-bbe-TNTzab-Tzac-kabe; thatis, glzg-l2y. And a-Tb-Te-a ea --Th-Tes-pas aXaL-FaC-TadThe-Khd-Ted, that is again, prB-h2g, or Banpl-29. And so for any other number of quantities. In general therefore, \" l the \" sum of the squares of the roots may always be found \" by subtracting, 27 from p1; the quantities p and 9 being always known, since they are the coefsicients in the proposed equation. The sum of the cubes of the roots of any equation is equal to Pl-3poF3r, or to Bp-Pg-Tar. For I--gxp gives always the excess of the sum of the cubes of any, quantities above the triple sum of the products. that can be made by multiplying any three of them. Thus, of FoL-Fel---n E--ge--Sexa LhTe taull -- yyphas aL-TMl-be l---gzabe. Therefore if the sum of the cubes is called C, then shall E--gypaC--3r, and Cezsp-gp Fora shecause Beapl --24)mpl.---Sho-l3r. After the same manner, if D be the sum of the 4th lowers of the roots, you will find that Dizph---yhTps 4s, and if E be the sum of the 5th powers, then shall ELpD---yC-Trh-pi-Tyt. And after the same manner the sum of any powers of the roots may be found ; the progression of these expressicus of the sum of the powers being obvious. As for the signs of the terms of the equation produced, it appears, from inspection, that the signs of all the terms in any equation in the table are alternately T and : these equations are generated by multiplying contiqually N--a, N--b, &c, Xd, &c. by one another. The first term is always some pure power of X, and is positive; the second is a power of x multiplied by the quantities --va, -b, -c, &c. And fince these are all negative, that term must therefore be negative. The third term has the products of any two of these quantities (--a, ---b, --c, &c. ) for its coefficient ; which products are all positive, because --K-- gives T. For the like reason, the next coefficient, consisting of all the products made by multiplying any three of these quantities must be negative, and the next positive. So that the coefficients, in this case, will be positive and negative by turns. But, \" in this case the roots are all positive ; since vaa, azzh, wize, xzd, 22zze, &c. are the assumed imple equations. It is plain then, that \" when all the \" roots are positive, the sigus are alternately F and But if the roots are all negative, then K-Taxx-Fix NTeXA-Td, &c. 20. will express the equation to be produced ; all whose terms will plainly be positive; so that, \" when all the roots of an equation are negative, it is \" plain there will be no changes in the signs of the terms \"e of that equation.\" In general, \" there are as many positive roots in any e\" quation as there are changes in the signs of the terms from T to , or from  to F; and the remaining \" roots are negative. The rule is general, if the imossible roots be allowed to be either positive or negative ; and may be extended to all kinds of equations. In quadratic equations, the two roots are either both positive, as in this C-ANKE--soy a1-N-Taleso, Bx where there are two changes of the signs : Or they are both negative, as in this Ce-axePheny 2 Ægl acalio, where there is not any change of the signs : Or there is one positive and one negative, as in K-ANK-Thay 2 -d Th) N---AtbO, where there is necessarily one change of the signs ; because the first term is positive, and the last negative, and there can be but one change whether the 2d term be TOf -\" Therefore the rule given in the last paragraph extends to all quadratic equations. In cubic equations, the roots may bes,, 10. All positive, as in this, V--axx-EyK --gao, in which the signs are alternately T and -, as appears from the table ; and there are three changes of the signs. 20. The roots may be all negative, as in the equation N-FaxK-TENN-Tezo, where there can be no change of the signs. Or, 37. There may be two positive roots and one negative, as in the equation X--axK--byx-Temo ; which gives N l-a ) Tal 3 2L.--ac e x-Palezto. Fe) -he) Here there must be two changes of the signs ; because if a-kh is greater than e, the second term must be negative, its coefsicient being -a---B-Fe. And if a-Kh is less than e, then the third term must be negative, its coefsicient Tal-at---lelab-exXA-Thy being in that case negative. And there cannot possibly bo three changes of the signs, the first and last terms having the same sign. There may be one positive root and two negative, as in the equation N-TaxX-TIXK--e-o, which gives Nl-Fa) Tab) PLOXS.--nC b k--alewo. e) -he) where Because the rectongle axb is less than the square ATOXA-Tb, and therefore much less than aThxe. where there must be always one change of the signs, since the first term is positive and the last negative. And there can be lut one change of the signs, since if the 2d term is negative, or a-Kh less than e, the third must be negative also, so that there will be but one change of the signs. Or, if the second term is affirmative, whatever the third term is, there will be but one change of the signs. It appears therefore, in general, that in cubic equations, there are as many affirmative roots as there are changes of the signs of the terms of the equation. There are several consectaries of what has been already demonstrated, that are of use in discovering the roots of equations. But before we proceed to that, it will be convenient to explain some transformations of equations, by which they may often be rendered more simple, and the investigation of their roots more easy. CRAP. XVI. Of the Transformation of Equations; and exterminating their intermediate Terms. We now proceed to explain the transformation of equations that are most useful : and, first, \" The affirma\" tive roots of an equation are changed into negative \" roots of the same value, and the negative roots into \" affirmative, by only changing the signs of the terms \" alternately, beginning with the second. Thus, the roots of the equation 2L---xI--ION--P49N---3oero are TI, T2, T3, 5; whereas the roots of the same equation having only the signs of the second and fourth terms changed, viz. 26Fx L--IONLT49N3ONo are I, 2, -3. T5. To understand the reason of this rule, let us assume an equation, as aK-axK-Eyx--XK-dy--T, &c. 220. whose roots are Ta, Th, Te, Td, Te, &c. and another, having its roots of the same value, but affected with contrary signs, as XTaxx-P-UxNTexN-TANN-Te, &c. 2n0. It is plain, that the terms taken alternately, beginning from the first, are the same in both equations, and have the same sign, \" being products of an even number \" of the roots; the product of any two roots having the same sign as their product when both their signs are changed ; as Fax-haL--aX-Th. But the second terms, and all taken alternately from them, because their coessicients involve always the products of an odd number of the roots, will have contrary signs in the two equations. For example, the product of four, viz. abed, having the same sign in both, and one equation in the fifth term having abedx-ke, and the other abedx-e, it follows, that their product abede omust have contrary signs in the two equations; these two equations therefore that have the same roots, but with contrary signs, have nothing different but the signs of the alternate terms, beginning with the second. From which it follows, \" that if any equation is given, and \" you change the signs of the alternate terms, begin\" ning with the second, the new equation will have roots \" of the same value, but with contrary signs. It is often very useful \" to transform an equation into \" another that shall have its roots greater or less than \" the roots of the proposed equation by some given dif\" ference.. Let the equation proposed be the cubic 2l--pN\\'-T9x riO. And let it be required to transform it into another equation whose roots shall be less than the roots of this equation by some given difference (O), that is, suppose yazy---e, and consequently xany-Te; then, instead of w and its powers, substitute -Fe and its powers, and there will arise this new equation. LbLL3o\\'-T3elyFT e1) Spey.-pe L2nO, T tyrge whose roots are less than the roots of the preceding epuation by the difference (e). If it had been required to find an equation whose roots should be greater than those of the proposed equation by the quanuity (o), then we must have supposed yaax-Te, and consequently xiy--e, and then the other equation would have had this form. (y l--3eylT3elyly.Tapey--pe1 6 2O. r U-Te C If the proposed equation be in this form XL-LpN\\'-Tge Frwo, then, by supposing x-Leny, there will arise an equation agreeing in all respects with the equation LA), but that the second and fourth terms will have contrary signs. And by supposing K--e-y, there will arise an equation greeing with (fy in all respects, but that the second and fourth terms will have contrary signs to what they nave in 1D) The first of these suppositions gives this equation, CCyl-zeyl T3ely- ebhy. --opey Tpe 6. 2co. T gy -ge Tr The second supposition gives the equation, DylP3O\\'-L3elyT e?) o-Eacly-The (o. F arge ( r 3 The first use of this transformation of equations is to shew \" how the second for other intermediate) term may \" be taken away out of an equation. It is plain, that in the equation (A) whose second term is 3C-poy\\', if you suppose exip, and consequently Se--pero, then the second term will vanish In the equation (C) whose second term is --3eTD7y), supposing eap, the second term also vanishes. Now the equation L) was deduced from :L--pæT-I9N---r-o, by supposing yaey-e: and the equation (Cy was deduced from al-Ppa\\'-Tox-Freo ; by supposing yw ATe. From which this rule may easily be deduced for exterminating the second term out of any cubic equation. RULE. RULS. Add to the unknown quantity of the given equation the third part of the coefsicient of the second term with its proper sign, viz. ercip, and suppose this nggregate equal to a new unknown quantity (7). From this value of y find a value of 2 by transposition, and substitute this value of 2 and its powers in the given equation, and there will arise a new equation that shall want the second term. EXAMP. Let it be required to exterminate the second term out of this equation, al.-ONL-P2GN--34,, suppose N-3iy, or y-lgwx; and substituting according to the rule, you will find W-LQy\\'-TaT-La. 9yl-54y--SII La6y-T--ys 3d. ao, then, according to the role, suppose p-kipons, substiuting this value for x, you will aod, WLPpy-Lip? w ip 6 2t0. E 3 ) roy and In which there is no term where y is of two dimensions, and an asterisk is placed in the room of the 2d term, to shew it is wanting. Let the equation proposed be of any number of dimensions represented by In); and let the coessicient of the second term with its sign prefixed be --p, then supposing K--2zy, and consequently Ny-L-ke, and substituting this value for x in the given equation, there will arise a new equation that shall want the second term. It is plain from what was demonstrated in chap. 15. that the sum of the roots of the proposed equation is Th; and since we suppose yzzxy---s, it follows, that, in the new equation, each value of y will be less than the respective value of a by Æ; and, since the number of the roots is n, it follows, that the sum of the values of y will be less than Tp, the sum of the values of X, by nxEe, the difference of any two roots, that is, by Ip: therefore the sum of the values of y will be ao. But the coessicient of the second term of the equation of y is the sum of the values of y, viz. Th--p, and therefore that coessicient is equal to nothing ; and consequently, in the equation of 7, the second term vanishes. It follows then, that the second term may be exterminated out of any given equation by the following RULE. Divide the coefficient of the second term of the proposed equation by the number of dimensions of the equation ; and assuming a new unknown quantity , add to it the quotient having its sign changed. Then suppose this aggregate equal to a the unknown quantity in the proposed equation ; and for x and its powers, substitute the aggregate and its powers, sor shall the new equation that arises want its second term. of Sul I. And from this example the use of exterminating the ad term appears : for commonly the solution of the equation that wants the 2d term is more easy. And, if youcan find the value of y from this new equation, it is easy to find the value of 2, by means of the equation y-Pipazy., For example, Since 7LLo-FpIæ0, it follows, that Ptanlpl--y, and 7-zE3. EPT--y, so that acy-Pep-ypaliof spr -3; which agrees with what we demonstrated, chap. 12. If the proposed equation is a biquadratic, as 2f.-pæ l PON\\'-TA-Piano, then, by supposing 2-zpmy or xay Ten, an equation shall arise having no second term. And if the proposed equation is of 5 dimensions, then fou must suppose xaakcip. And so on. When the second term in any equation is wanting. it follows, that \" the equation has both affirmative and ne\" gative roots and that i the sum of the affirmative \" roots is equal to the sum of the negative roots o? by which means the coessicient of the 2d term, which is the sum of all the roots of both sorts, vanishes, and makes the second term vanish. In general, \" The coefficient of the 2d term is the \" difference between the sum of the affirmative roots \" roots and the sum of the negative roots \" and the operations we have given serve only to diminish all the roots when the sum of the affirmative is greatest, or increase the roots when the sum of the negative is greatest, so as to balance them, and reduce them to an equality. It is obvious, that in a quadratic equation that wants the second term, there must be one root affirmative and one negative; and these must be equal to one another. In a cubic equation that wants the second term, there must be either two affirmative roots equal, taken together to a third root that must be negative ; or, two negative equal to a third that must be positive. \" Let an equation Kl--px\\'-Toy-rao be proposed, \" and let it be now required to exterminate the third \" term.\" By supposing ya--e, the coessicient of the 3d term in the equation of y is found (see equation A) to be 3e8 Spe-Lo. Suppose that coessicient equal to nothing, and by resolving the quadratic equation 3e --ape-Tgino, vou will find the value of e, which substituted for it in the equation yx-e, will shew how to transform the proposed equation into one that shall want the third term. The quadratic ge --apeTso, gives eLEAE35. So that the proposed cubic will be transformed into an equation wanting the third term by supposing jzexF LLN ES. If the proposed equation is a quadratic, as a--pK-Ty Dd L. If the proposed equation is of n dimensions, the value of e, by which the 3d term may be taken away, is had by resolving the quadratic equation o¬-L-E. Xe-J--2. AACiI 0, supposing --p and Fo to be the coessicients of the 2d and 3d terms of the proposed equation. The 4th term of any equation may be taken away by solving a cubic equation, which is the coefficient of the gth term in the equation, when transformed, as in the former part of this chapter. The fifth term may be taken away by solving a biquadratic ; and after the same manner the other terms can be exterminated if there are any. There are other transmutations of equations that, on some occasions, are useful. An equation, as Xl-pK\\'-TIN--rwo, \" may be trans\" formed into another that shall have its roots equal to \" the routs of this equation multiplied by a given quan\" tity as f, by supposing y2isx, and consequently wily, and substituting this value for x in the proposed formed into the equation yl---13y-FIAN3NN-FIGXomo, or yl--TR9Y-TAZY-TI44,O. Then finding the roots of this equation, it will easily he discovered what are the roots of the proposed equation, ince 3wizy, or xaxty. And therefore, since one of the values of y is ---z, it follows, that one of the values of N is ---F. By the last rule, \" an equation is easily cleared of \" fractions. Suppose the equation proposed. is 2I. iroif. Multiply all the terms by the tiplying all by TI. y.TnyL-Ff 14y-Ttrazo, where the coefsicient of the 2d term of the proposed equation. qnultiplied into f, makes the coefsicient of the 2d term of the transformed equation ; and the following coefsicients are produced by the following coefficients of the aroposed equation, (as 4, r, &c.) multiplied into the powers of f Ur\\'. 1 ), &C.). Therefore \" to transform any equation into another whose roots shall be equal to the roots of the proposed equation multiplied by a given quantity Uf )f you need only multiply the terms of the proposed equation, beginning at the 2d term, by 6 f\\'. FI. fs, &c. and putting y instead of N, there will arise an equation having its roots equal to the roots of the proposed equation multiplied by Uf ) as required. The transformation mentioned above is of use when the highest term of the equation has a coefficient different from unity ; for, by it, the equation may be transformed into one that shall have the coefficient of the highest term unit. If the equation proposed is arL-PNL-Tox-v-no, then transform the equation into one whose roots are equal to the roots of the proposed equation multiplied by (a). That is, suppose yizax or xad and there will arise 1.-Fig,. TE--ao; so that 7L-py\\'-L9ay--ra\\'anc. From which we easily draw this RULE. Change the unknown quantity x into another y, presix no coessicient to the highest term, pass the 2d, multiply the following terms, beginning with the 3d, by a, a, 21, &S, &c. the powers of the coefsiciens of the highest term of the proposed equation, respectively. Thus the equation 3NL-I3NLPIANTIGmo, is tranf product of the denominators, you find mnexxl---nepxa\\'-LmegxXN-mnr-o. Then kas abovey transforming the equation into one that hall have unit for the coessicient of the highest term, you find Yl--nepxy:-Pmse\\'ngxy-mlnlelrwo. Or, neglecting the denominator of the last term-you need only multiply all the equation by mn, which will give mnxx l-upxx L-Lmgxæ- -St2n0. And then. 7l--npxy l-Tm kng Ny-s m0. Now after the values of y are found, it will be easy to discover the values of N; since, in the first case, VE ; in the second, 2zz. For example, the equation. Y-- Ly ao, is first reduced to this form 3N I..-4N- g120, and then transformed into 7IT.--1Z---146-NO. Sometimes, by these transformations, \" surds are taken away. As for exampie, The equation NL--posaxæ\\'-ToN-orofamo, by purting yoaxx, orx-nig , is transformed into this equation, 2.. PUaNC.-TONZ.-Toanco. Which, by multiblying all the terms by ana, becomes 7 l--pay-Tgay ra 2o, an equation free of surds. But in order to make this succeed, the surd (oay must enter the alterpate terms, beginning with the second. An equation, as aL-pN\\'-Fox----o, may be trans\" formed into one whose roots shall be the quantities re\" ciprocal of 2o by supposing 72z-k. and 722, or dby one supposition), an, becomes 2l.---g2LTpraT2NO. In the equation of y, it is manifest, that the order of the coefficients is inverted ; so that, if the second term had been wanting in the proposed equation, the last but one should have been wanting in the equations of y and 2. If the 3d had been wanting in the equation proposed, the last but two had been wanting in the equations of y and 2. Another use of this transformation is, that the great 5OY est root in the one is tranformed into the least root in the other. For fince w 2e s. and y23,. it is plain, that when the value of a is greatest, the value of y is least, and conversely. How an equation is transformed so as to have all its roots affirmative, shall be explained in the following chapter. CHAP. XVII. Of sinding the ROOTS of Equations when two or more of the Roots are equal to each other. 1. BEPORE we proceed to explain how to resolve equations of all sorts, we shall first demonstrate bhoto an equation that has hus or more roots equal, is depressed 1o a lower dimension ; and its resolution made, consequently, more easy. And shall endeavour to explain the grounds of this and many other rules we shall give in the remaining part of this treatise, in a more simple and concise manner than has hitherto been done. In order to this, we must lonk hack to the last chapter, where we find, that if any equation, as a L--pxl-ToN--rano, is 7roposed, and yeu are to transform it into another that shall have its roots lss than the values of x by any given difference, as e, you are to assume y 227-ie, and substituting for a its value 7Te, you find the transformed equation, Phgerl T3ely F es. -gyl --apey.--Fe CzO. T9y Fis O Where we are to observe, 17. That the last term lek-pel d-ge-rY is the very equation that was proposed, having e in place of 2. 20. The coefsicient of the last term but one is 3e\\'ppe-Ty, which is the quantity that arises by multiplying every term of the last coefficient el-pel-roe--r by the index of e in each term, and dividing the product aclapeL-Fge by the quantity e that is common to all the terms. ge. The coefsicient of the last term but two is 3e--, which is the quantity that arises by multiplying every term of the coessicient last found (3o 1-2pe-Te; by the index of e in each term, and dividing the whole by 2e. 62. These same observations extend to equations of all dimensions. If it is the hiquadratic \\'---TN\\'bow\\' -N-tiro that is proposed, then by supposing 722--e, it will be transformed into this other, Lacy-K6e 1y 2-LAcly Fet. pyl-apayl -apely-pes o gy? T290 T ge1 S. 20. ve A Ts Where again it is obvious, That the last term is the equation that was proposed, having e in place of X : That the last term but one has for its coessicient the quantity by the inisces ofe la cied teons, and fuede hne ieduct by ec. That the coefsicient of the last term but two, lviz, 6l --Spe-Lgy is deduced in the same manner from the term immediately following, that is, by multiplying. every term of 4cl.-gpol-L-ape--r by the index of e in that term, and dividing the whole by e multiplied into the index of y in the term sought, that is, by exz : And the next term is 40---pance 3pext The demonstration of this may easily be made general by the theorem for finding the powers of a binomial, ince the transformed equation consists of the powers of the binomial y-Fe that are marked by the indices of e in the last term, multiplied each by their coessicients 1. P, T5. F Fs, &c. respectively. 3. From the last two articles we can easily find the terms of the transformed equation without any involution. The ast term is had by substituting e instead of x in the proposed equation ; the next term, by multiplving ever part of that last term by the index of e in each part, and lividing the whole by e; and the following terms in the nanner described in the foregoing articte ; the respective divisors being the quantity e multiplied by the index of y in each term. The demonstration for finding when two or more roots are equal will be easy, if we add to this, that \" when \" the unknown quantity enters all the terms of any equa\" tion, then one of its values is equal to nothing. As in the equation NI-pNL-Ly2mo, where a--owo being one of the simple equations that produce af.-- pæs afgeazo, it follows that one of the values of Nis o. In like manner, two of the values of w are equal to nothing in this equation NI---pnl 20; and three of them vanish in the equation wh.---pyl2o. It is also obvious teonverselyy that \" if e does not en\" ter all the terms of the equation, i. e. if the last term \" be not wanting, thenenone of the values of x can be \" equal to nothing, for if every term be not multiplied by X, then e-0 cannot be a divisor of the whole equation, and consequently o cannot be one of the values of a. If xt does not enter into all the terms of the equation, then two of the values of e cannot be equal to nothing. If yi does not enter into all the terms of the equation, then three of the valnes of a cannot be equal to nothing, &c. 84. Suppose now that two values of a are equal to oned another, and to e; then it is plain that two values of y in the transformed equation will be equal to nothing ; aince jazs--ve. And consequently, by the last article, the two last terms of the transformed equation must vanish Suppose it is the cubic equation of 8 I. that is proposed, viz. X.-BYL-LON--TœO; and because we suppose vaze, therefore the last term of the transformed eqration, viz. e L-pel-Tor--T will vanish. And since two values of y vanish, the last term but one, viz. Se F-apey-Tgy will vanish at the same time. So that l.-zhe-To 0. But, by supposition, e; therefore, when two values of x, in the equation, a L--EN\\'-lgyrwo, are equal, it follows, that 3N.---2pN-Tomo. And thus, \" the proposed cubic is depressed to a quadratic \" that has one of its roots equal to one of the roots of \" that cubic.\" If it is the biquadratic that is proposed, viz. t. PNL-LgN\\'-TN-Tir-no, and two of its roots be equal ; then supposing raay, two of the values of 7 must vanish, and the equation of 52. will be reduced to this form. LTacy L-LOe 1y1) L-3Be7C 12 20. So that F 57 1) Ael- ape: -L29C--TWO; or, because Nme, 3PNY-TSON--TINO. In general, when two values of a are equal to each other, and to e, the two last terms of the transformed equation vanish : and consequently, \" if you multiply the terms of the proposed equation by the indices of \" 2 in each term, the quantity that will arise will be 2o, \" and will give an equation of a lower dimension than \" the proposed, that shall have one of its roots equa \" to one of the roots of the proposed equation.\" That the last two terms of the equation vanish when the values of x are supposed equal to each other, and to e, will also appear by considering, that since two values of y then become equal to nothing, the product of the values of y must vanish, which is equal to the last ternof the equation; and because two of the four values of y are equal to nothing, it follows also that one of any hree that can be taken out of these four must be 220 ; and therefore, the products made by multiplying any three must vanish ; and consequently the coefficient of the last term but one, which is equal to the sum of these products, must vanish 55. After the same manner, if there are three equal roots in the biquadratic N--px IFg\\'--rx-hæso, and if e be equal to one of them, three values of y Cen---a) will ranish, and consequently yl will enter all the terms of the transformed equation ; which will have this form, PLPA ( 12020. So that here OeL--pe-Lgto; or, since eezy, therefore, 6N\\'-apx-lgwo ; and one of the roots of this quadratic will be equal to one of the roots of the proposed biquadratic. In this case, two of the roots of the cubic equation 4NL-3ON\\'-F2oN--rwo are roots of the proposed biquadratic, because the quantity ONL-XpN-Ty is deduced from AxL-XpN\\'-P2oN---T, by multiplying the terms by the indexes of 2 in each term. In general, \" whatever is the number of equal roots \" in the proposed equation, they will all remain but one \" in the equation that is deduced from it, by multiplying \" all the terms by the indexes of x in them ; and they \" will all remain but two in the equation deduced in the \" same manner from that; and so of the rest. 56. What we observed of the coefsicients of equations. transformed by supposing yzex---e, leads to this easy demonstration of this rule ; and will be applied in the next chapter to demonstrate the rules for sinding the limits of equations. It is obvious, however, that though we make use of equations whose signs change alternately, the same reasoning extends to all other equations. It is a consequence also of what has been demonstrated, that \"if two roots of any equation, as, \" Nh-pN\\'f9x---reno, are equal, then \" multiplying the terms by any arithmetical series, as, \" a-L3h, a-hab, aTh, a, the product will be ao.\" For, since ax L-APNY--aqx--ar-o ; and 3NC-SPNTONh,-O, it follows that ANl-F3bN L--apK\\'---QbpN\\'-Tagx-Thox--armo. WVhich is the product that arises by multiplying the terms of the proposed equation by the terms of the series, aT3h, a-hab, aTh, a; which may represent any arithmetical progression. CHAP. XVIII. Of the LIMITS of Equations. We now proceed to shew how to discover the limits. of the roots of equations, by which their solution is much facilitated, Let any equation, as XL--pY\\'-Tox-rwo be proposed ; and transform it, as above, into the equation 7P3eyLF3ely-Tes apey--pe (2O. F 97 Zhc.. WVhere the values of y are less than the respective values of x by the difference e. If you suppose e to be taken. such as to make all the coefficients of the equation of y positive, viz. e--peL-Foe-T, 3e --apeTs, 3e---p; then there being no variation of the sigus in the equation, all the values of y must be negative ; and consequently, the quantity e, by which the values of N are diminished, must be greater than the greatest positive value f 2; and consequently must be the limit of the roots of the equation XL--pNL-Lox--rao. It is sufficient therefore, in order to find the limit, to \" inquire what quantity substituted for w in each of these \" expressions aL-pN\\'-Tox-T, 3NT--pK-Fg, 3N--P, \" will give them all positive ;\" for that quantity will be the limit required. How these expressions are formed from one another, was explained in the beginning of the last chapter. EXAMP. If the equation af -- Zas--- 1ONLL 30NTIG3N-FI2OO is proposed ; and it is required to determine the limit that is greater than any of the roots ; you are to inquire what integer number substituted for x in the roposed equation, and following equations deduced from it by 53. chap. 17. will give, in each, a positive quantity. 5NL--BNl--3ONL-LOON-T6; 1AKL--6æI-- 15NTI5. 52----4Y-5 5N 4. The least integer number which gives each of these positive, is 2 ; which therefore is the limit of the roots top of the proposed equation ; or a mimber that exceeds the greatest positive root. If the limit of the negative roots is reouired, you may sby chap. 16. change the negative into positive roots, and then proceed as before to find their limits. Thus, in the example, you will find, that 3 is the limit of the negative roots. So that the five roots of the proposed equation are betwixt ---g and -z. Having found the limit that surpasses the greatest positive root, call it m. And if you assume yazu--x, and for x substitute m-y, the equation that will arise will have all its roots positive; because m is supposed to surpass all the values of x, and consequently m-x (enyy must always be affirmative. And, by this means, any equation may be changed into one that shall have all its roots affirmative. Or, if -n represent the limit of the negative roots, then by assuming jey-Fn, the proposed equation shall be transformed into one that shall have all its roots affirmative; for Tn being greater than any negative value of X, it follows, thatytx-in must be always positive. The greatest negative corfficient of any equation inereased by unit, always eaceeds the greatest root of the equation. To demonstrate this, let the cubic N--pa Lreo be pronosed; where all the terms are negative except the first. Assuming jtax--e, it will be transformed into the following equation ; (AJ7LL3OyL-P3ely-l-es Lmpoy--TeN(, 2o. Qy qe 10. Let us suppose that the coefficients 9. 9. r,. are equal to each other ; and if you also suppose epTT; then the last equation becomes (yyL-LagyL-FplyT1) Aa Eany. 520; where all the terms being pesitive, it follows that the values of y are all negative, and that consequently e, or P-FI, is greater than the greatest value of x in the proposed equation. 26. If y and r be not 2p, but less than it, and for e you still substitute p-ls (since the negative part (--Qy-Te becomes less, the positive remdmning undiminished,) d fortiori, all the coessicients of the equation () become positive. And the same is obvious if o and r have positive signs, and not negative signs, as we supposed. It appears therefore, \" that if, in any cubic equation, p \" be the greatest negative coefficient, then p-rt must surpass the greatest value of 7. b. By the same reasoning it appears, that if 9 be the greatest negative coefsicient of the equation, and enyTI, then there will be no variation of the signs in the equation of y : for it appears from the last article, that if all the three I9, 9. r  were equal to one another, and e equal to any one of them increased by unit, as to yTI. then all the terms of the equation LA) would bo bositive. Now if e be supposed still equal to g-lt, and p and r to be less than 9, then, a fortiori, all these terms will be positive, the negative part, which involves p and r being diminished, while the positive part and the negative involving o remain as before. 0. After the same manner it is demonstrated, that if r is the greatest negative coefsicient in the equation, and e is supposed er-PI, then all the terms of the equation. Lo) of y will be positive; and consequently r-Ft will be greater than any of the values of Y. What we have said of the cubic equation NL-pRtfIN--ræo, is easily applicable to others. In general, we conclude, that \" the greatest negative \" coesficient in any equation increased by unit, is always \" a limit that exceeds all the roots of that equation.\" But it is to be obselved at the same time, that the greatest negative coefficient increased by unit, is very seldom the nearest lingt: that is best discovered by the vule in the beginning of this chapter. Having shewn how to change any proposed equation into one that shall have all its roots affirmative; we shall oaly treat of such as have all their roots positive, in what remains relating to the limits of equations. Any such equation may be represented by K--aXÆ--8 NK-eXK--d, &c. 220, whose roots are a, b c. d, &c. And of all such equations two limits are easily discovered from what precedes, viz. 0, which is less than the least, and e, found as directed in the beginning of this chapter, which surpasses the greatest rout of the equation. But, besides these, we shall now shew how to find ether limits betwixt the roots themselves. And, for this purpose, will suppose a to be the least root, h the second root, e the third, and so on; it being arbitrary. If you substitute o in place of the unknown quantity, putting 2zo, the quantity that will arise from that supposition is the last term of the equation, all the others that involve x vanishing. If you substitute for x a quantity less than the least root a, the quantity refulting will have the same sign as the last term ; that is, will be positive or negative according as the equation is of an even or odd number of dimensions. For all the factors 2---a, N---8, N--e, &c. will be negative, and their product will be positive or negotive according as their number is oven or cad. If you substitute for y a quantity greater than the least root a, but less than all the other roots, then the sign of the quantity resulting will be contrary to what it was before ; because one factor te --- a) becomes now positive, all the others remaining negative as before. If yon substitute for a a quantity greater than the two east roots, but less than all the rest, buth the factors N--M, K--E, become positive, and the rest remain as they were. So that the whole product will have the same sign as the last term of the equation. Thus succesjively placing instead of a quantities that are limits betwixt the roots of the equation, the quantities that result will have alternately the signs f and . And, convenscly, \" if you find quantities which, substituted in place of x in the proposed equation, do give alter\" nately positive and negative results, those quantities \" are the limits of that equation.\" E e 11o It is useful to observe, that, in general, \" when, by \" substituting any two numbers for x in any equation, \" the results have contrary signs, one or more of the \" roots of the equation must be betwixt those numbers. Thus, in the equation, aI--zK\\'---5wo, if you substitute 2 and 3 for X, the results are 5, Fa; whence it follows, that the roots are betwixt a and 3; for when these results have different signs, one or other of the factors which produce the equations must have changed its sign ; suppose it is eae, then it is plain that e must be betwixt the numbers supposed equal to N.\" Let the cubic equation 2L-pNY-lgx---nno be proosed, and let it be transformed, by assuning 7ezx--e, into the equation 7L-L3eyl F3ely -FeIY f --apey. --e LæO. T97 Fgs O. gee values Let us suppose e equal successively to the of y, beginning with the least value ; and because the last ternt e L--peLFor--r will vanish in all these suppositions, the equation will have this form 7F3ey F3e1) By --ape Z2O;. Tf A where the last term 3eL---zpe-Lg is, from the nature of equations, produced of the remaining values of 7, or of the excesses of two other values of a above what is supposed equal to e; since always yaaty---e. Now, 10. If e be equal to the least value of X, then those two excesses bring both positive, they will give a positive product, and consequently 3r \\'---ape-Tg will be, in this case, positive. 36. Ife be equal to the second value of X, then, of those two excesses, one heing negative and one positive, their product 3o1. --2he-bg, will be negative. 30. If e be equal to the third and greatest value of X, then the two excesses being both negative, their product . --2pe-ls is positive. Whence, f in the equation 311--2he-Lywo, you substitute successively in the palce of e, the three roots of the equation oL-pe Ty--20, the quantities resulting will cubic equation, which suppose to be a, b. e, substituted successively have the signs T, . F; and consequently the three roots of the cubic equation are the limits of the roots of the equation 3ef ---2pe-T9o. That is, the least of the roots of the cubic is less than the least of the roots of the other ; the second root of the cubic is a limit between the two roots of the other ; and the greatest root of the cubic is the limit that ex¬ the remainder is pak---zgLraNxa. In the same ceeds both the roots of the other. We have demonstrated, that the ronts of the cubic. equation oL-pe\\'-Lge-r-wo are limits of the quadratic te -ape-To; whence it follows f convensely ; that the roots of the quadratic Sel-zpe-tono are the limits be¬ are limits of the equation 9 -z9K-Lario, by p. 109. tween the first and second, and between the second and third roots of the cubic eL--pe\\'-Lor--rmo. So that if yout find the limit that exceeds the greatest root of the cubic, by the beginning of this chapter you will have twith o, peL-Tg.-Tio. Now the equation pa¬--zgT3r&o a which is the limit less than any of the roots) four limits for the threeroots of the proposed cubic. It was demonstrated in chap 17. 53. how the quadratic. ge  ape-Fo is deduced from the proposed cubic elPe?-Logo---rwo, viz. by multiplying each term by the index of e in it, and then dividing the whole by e and what we have demonstrated of cubic equations is easily extended to all others ; so that we conclude \" that the \" last term but one of the transformed equation is the \" equation for determining the limits of the proposed \" equation. Or, that the equation arising by multialying each term by the index of the unknown quantity in it, is the equation whose roots give the limits of the proposed equation ; if you add to them the two mentioned in p. 109. col. 2. par. 4. For the same reason, it is plain that the root of the simple equation 3e---rizo, Ui. e. ipl is the limit between the two roots of the quadratic 3r ---ape-Lptto. And, as 4e L-Spe\\'-Ta9---rwo gives three limits of the equation of -Pe l-Tge k--re-Tsœo, so the quatratic Sel---Sse-rsmno gives two limits that are betwixt the ronts of the cubic Acl---Sfe T2e--T2O; and AC---Po gives one limit that is betwixt the two roots of the quadratic bo \\'--Spe-Ty zo. So that we have a complete series of these equations arising from a simple equation to the proposed, each of which determines the imits of the following equation. If two roots in the proposed equation are equal, then \" the limit that ought to be betwixt them must, in this case, become equal to one of the equal roots \" themselves. Which perfectly agrees with what was demonstrated in the last chapter, concerning the rule for finding the equal roots of equations. And, the same equation that gives the limits, giving also one of the equal roots, when two or more are equal, it appears, that \" if yon substitute a limit in place of the unknown quantity in an equation and, instead of a positive or negative result, it be found 2o, then youmay conclude, that \" not only the limit itself is a root \" of the equation, but that there are two roots in that \" equation equal to it and to one another It having been demonstrated, that the roots of the equation N l--p\\'-Lga---rano are the limits of the roots of the equation 321. --2px-k920, the three roots of the for æ in the quadratic 3o K---2px-Tg, must give the results positive and negative alternately. Suppose these three results to be TN. ---- M, TL; that is, 3.T-apA-TO-N, 3b1--aphLg.-M, 3e1---2pC-LgZL; and since a l-pu\\'d 3a---rw0, and 3. L-2pa1-PQuzNXa, subtracting the former multiplied into 3 from the latter, manner ph.--Z9hL3r--AIXh, and pet-zpe--T3r-T Lxe. Therefore pæl.-2g. -Lgr is such a quantity, that if, for a, you substitute in it successively a, h, e the results will be -LNX . ---Mxh, Tlxe. Whence a, b, ecol. 2. par. 8. and, conversely, the roots of the equation P. L-29TT3r-o are limits between the first and second, and between the second and third roots of the cubic y rises from the proposed cubic by multiplying the terms of this latter by the arithmetical progression o, I. 2, 3. And, in the same manner, it may be shewn that the roots of the equation pa l--2;a LF3r---roo are limits of the equation a---pælorg T-rN-TrNo. Or, multiply the terms of the equation 2 l--PN\\'ToKræo by a-T3h, a-Lab, a-Ph, a Cl Srp tel F3bax l-zbpuk-phox (nyy\\'--ap.-TgXlN) Any arithmetical series where a is the least term, and 5. tute for x, successively, a, b c. the three roots of the proa, b e, being limits in the equation 3a---apK-hy-o, their substitution must give results N. M, L., alternately positive and negative. neral, the roots of the equation an a- y---TlX---LF, &c. 2zo ; or of any equation that is deduced from it by multiplying its terms by any arithmetical progression, anach, zlezh, anegh, nczzih, &c. And, canversely, the roots of this new equation will be limits of the proposed equation. NT---Puli-LPgNY--T-, &c. 200. \"If any roots of the equation of the limits are im\" possible, then must there be some roots of the proposed. \" equation impossible\". For as (inp. 110, col. I. par. 2. the quantity 3o l-- apeds was demonstrated to be equal to tioned by other authors. the product of the excesses of two values of x above the third supposed equal to e; if any impussible expression. be found in those excesses, then there will of contequence be found impossible expressions in these two values of X. And \" from this observation rules may be deduced for be greater than 3, or TE. And, \" discovering when there are impossible roots in equa\" tions. Of which we shall treat afterwards. by which limits may be determined which the root of an equation cannot exceed. Since the squares of all real quantities are affirmative, follows, that \" the sum of the squares of the roots of \" any equation must be greater than the sonare of the greatest root. And the square root of that sum will therefore be a limit that must exceed the greatest root of the equation. If the equation proposed is a\\'---PXE--T-LgNt---TPæK-LI, &c. w20, then the sum of the squares of the roots Ip. 103. col. 1. par. 1 ) will be PL-2g. So that 9.-2g will exceed the greatest root of that equation. Or if you find, by 9. 103. cal. 1. par. 4. the sum of the 4th powers of the roots of the equation, and extract the biquadratic root of that sum, it will also exceed the greatest root of the equation. If you find a mean proportional between the sum of the squares of any two roots, a, b, and the sum of their 1II biquadrates (a--Lh\\',) this mean proportional will be oaC-Ta IPPathtF8s. And the sum of the cubes is CLLDI. Now, since al-zab-Th\\' is the square of a---hs it must be always positive; and if you multiply it by ahI, the product Af9k-za IBL-parb: will also be positive; and consequently a hkpa ths will be always greater than 22163. Add al-yhs and we have af-Pa\\'6hath-Lss greater than ababzatol-bd\\' ; and extracting the root ab-Path-Pa IP-Kss greater than al-Fhs. And the same may be demonstrated of any number of roots whatever. Now, if you add the sum of all the cubes taken affirthe common difference, and the products (if you substi matively to their sum with their proper signs, they will give double the sum of the cubes of the affirmative roots. posed cubicy shall be -TNXhy, --ABXhN-FLNbN, For the And if you subtract the second sum from the first, there iist part of the product oxxl-pokEgx--reo; and will remain double the sum of the cubes of the negative routs. Whence it follows, that \" half the sum of the \" mean proportional betwixt the sum of the squares \" and the sum of the biquadrates, and of the sum\" of the cubes of the roots with their proper signs, ex\" ceeds the sum of the cubes of the afirmatve roots tFO.T--LFK--IF, &c. w0 are limits of the roots of the and \" half their difference exceeds the sum of the cubes equation men--L--K-INPN.-LALK--AYONL--L-E--3X \" of the negative roots. And, by extracting the cube root of that sum and difference, you will obtain limits that shall exceed the sums of the affirmative and of the negative roots. And since it is easy, from what bas been already explained, to diminish the roots of an equation so that they all may become negative but one, it appears how, by this means, you may approximate very near to that root. Bot this does not serve when there are impossible roots. Several other rules like these might be given for limiting the roots of equations. We shall give one not meuIn a cubie 2l--p, Pqx-rao, find g1--2pr, and call it e; then shall the greatest root of the equation always In any equationlyt--pU--L-EONd--K-rxt--g-, &c. me, Besides the method already explained, there are others fad Cwicsnss, and extracting the root of the 4th h.\" power out of that quantity, it shall always be less than the greatest root of the equation. CRAP. XI. Of the Reselution of Equations, all whose Root are tommensurute. IT was demonstrated in chap. 15. that the last term of any equation is the product of its routs: from which it fostows, that the roots of an equation, when commensurable quantities, will he found among the divifors of the last term. And hence we have, for the resolution of equations, this RULE. Bring all the terms to one side of the equation, sind all the divisors of the last term, and substirute them successively for the unknown quantity in the equation. So shall that divifor which, substituted in this manner, FIZ. manner, gives the result wo, be the root of the proposed equation. For example, suppose this equation is to be refolved, 2 l--3axL-LaalX-za1S; 2o. T bæL-E3aby. where the last term is zaYh, whose simple literal divisors. are a, b, 2a, 2b, each of which may be taken either positively or negatively : but as here we find there are ariations of signs in the equation, we need only take them positively. Suppose xiza the first of the divisors, and substituting a forX, the equation becomes 4l--gal-Fzal--za h; or, 3al-qal-Fyalb---a1lco 41h T3ath So that, the whole vanishing, it follows, that a is one of the roots of the equation. After the same manner, if you substitute b in palce of x, the equation is el itieds. ane Igao. ante scer. alb; duce from the root already found, and the quotient shall give an equation of a degree lower than the proposed ; whose roots will give the remaining roots required. As for example, the root T3, first found, gave xi3, or N--32NO, whence dividing thus, 3) NL--2N---Z3NT9O INY-FK--3O 2 L--3X NI--33NT9o NT---3Y Blsiltites which vanishing, shews bto be another root of the equation. Again, if you substitute 2a for N, you will find al the terms destroy one another so as to make the sum ano. For it will then be Whence we find, that 2a is the third root of the equation. Which, after the first two CTa, Thy had been. found, might have been collected from this, that the last term being the product of the three roots, Ta, Th, being known, the third must necessarily be equal to the last term divided by the product ab, that is, ais nega, Let the roots of the cubic equation. N L.--2x1--33N-Looao be required. And first the divisors of 90 are found to be 1. 2. 3, 5. S, 9, 10, 15. 18, 30, 45, 90. If you substitute 1 for x, you will find 2L.--zNT---33NT90-56; so that 1 is not a rout of the equation. If you substitute 2 for X, the result will be 24; but, putting wng, you have NL--2NY--33N-TSOTEY-IS-99-T9OIIJ---II7NO. So that three is one of the roots of the proposed equation. The other affirmative root is Ts ; and after you find it, as it is manifest from the equation, that the other root is negative, you are not to try any more divifors taken positively, but to substitute them, negatively taken, fora : and thus you find, that -6 is the third root For putting xiz--6, you have JNI---33NT9O-ZIC-TZ-TIOSToomo. This last root might have been found by dividing the last term 90, having its sign changed by 15, the product of the two roots already found.\" When one of the roots of an equation is found, in order to find the rest with less trouble, divide the proposed equation by the simple equation which you are to de The quotient shall give a quadratic equation 2-IY--3oeno, which must be the product of the other two simple equations from which the cubic is generated, and whose roots therefore must be two of the roots of that cubic. Now the roots of that quadratic equation are casily found, by chap. 12. to be T 5 and -6. For, N-Laz30 add 5. ATeTE-3OoEin bs W. AFizaksof Lglmalst and. Atg--F-Ts or 6. After the same manner, if the hiquadratic aI--zæ l25.\\'-Lz6N-TI2oo is to be resolved ; by substituting the divisors of 120 for a, you will find, that T3, one of those divisors, is one of the roots ; the substitution of * for a giving SI-5--Z25-T78TIZGE2JO---276000. And therefore, dividing the proposed equation by 3. you must inquire for the roots of the cubic ALJw\\'. -242 4000, and finding that T5, one of the divisors of 40, is one of the roots, you divide that cubic by A-3, and the quotient gives the quadratic a6o8aro, whose two roots are ---2, --v4. So that the four roots of the biquadratic are -F3, T5. 2, -4 This rule supposes that you can find all the divisors of the last term ; which you may always do thus. \" If it is a simpie quantity, divide it by its least divi\" for that exceeds unit, and the quotient again by its \" least divifor, proceeding thus till you have a quotient \" that is not divisible by any number greater than unit. \" This quotient, with these divisors, are the first or \" simple divisors of the quantity. And the products of \" the multiplication of any 2, 3, 4, &c. of them are. \" the compound divisers.\" As to find the divisors of 60; first I divide by 2. and the quotient 30 again by 2, then the the next quoI5 by 3, and the quotient of this division 5 is not farther divisible by any integer above units; so that the simpledivisors are, A, 2, 3. 5; The products of two, 4, 6, 10, 15. The products of three, 12, 20, 30. The product of all four   6o. The divisors of 90 are found after the same manner ; Simple divisors, 2 31 3, 5. The products of two, &. 6, 9, 10, 15. The products of three. I8, 30, 45. The product of all four,   90. The divisors of 2rabb. The simple divisors. 3, 7, a. b. b. The products of two, a1, 32, 3b, 7a, 7h, ab, 8h. The products of three, 21a, 21b, 3ab, 367, 7ab, 7hh, abb. The products of four, 21ab, 216h, 3abb, 7abh. The products of the five712bh. But as the last term may have very many divisors, and the labour may be very great to substitute them all for the unknown quantity, we shall now shew how it may be abridged, by limiting to a small number the divifors your are to try. And, first, it is plain, from p 199. col. 1. ar, 4. that \" any divifor that exceeds the greatest negate rive coefsicient by unity is to be neglected. Thus, in resolving the equation a\"--z2 L---S5W\\'-LaGE-PIZOo, as 35 is the greatest negative coefsicient, we conclude, that the divisors of 120 that execed 26 may be neglected. But the labour may be still abridged, if we make use of the rule in the beginning of ch 18.; that is, if we find the number which substituted in these following expressions, artend cnrls ig. 6NL---SY ZS, aN -I. will give in them all a positive result : for that number will be greater than the greatest root, and all the divisors of 120 that exceed it may be neglected. That this investigation may be easier, we ought to begin always with that expression where the negative ronts seem to prevall most ; as here in the quadratic expression. 6K --ON--z5; where finding that o substituted for a gives that expression positive, and gives all the other expressions at the same time positive, I conclude, that 6 is greater than any of the roots, and that all the divisors. of 120 that exceed 6 may be neglected. If the equation al-FIIAT-TIOL-T2-o is proposed, the rule of p. 109, col. I. par. 4. does not help to abridge the operation ; the last term itself being the greatest negative term. But, by chap. 18. we inquire what number substituted for a will give all these expressions positive. 1I3. Where the labour is very short, since we need only attend to the first expression ; and we see immediately that 4 substituted for e gives a positive result, whence all the divisors of 72 that exreed a are to he rejected ; and thus by a few trials, we find, that -ha is the positive roat of the equation. Then dividing the equation by 2--z, and resolving the quadratic equation that is the quotient of the division, you find the other two roots to be -, and But there is another method that reduces the divisors of the last term, that can be useful, still to more narrow limits. Suppose the cubic equation f L-PN\\'-Lox--rwno is proposed to be resolved. Transform it to an equation whose roots shall be less than the values of a by unity, assuming 32i--t. And the last term of the traneformed equation will be 1--7T4-K; which is found by substituting unit, the difference of a and y, for a, in the proposed equation ; as will easily appear from p. 106. col. 1 par, 4. where, when yaae-ve, the last term of the transformed equation was e L-pe\\'ol-or-r. Transform again the equation al--p LFgn-r-o, by assuming -nA-TI, into an equation whose roots shall exceed the values of a by unit, and the last term of the transformed equation will be ---1---4--T, the same that arises by substituting -T, the difference betwixt y and y, for y, in the proposed equation. Now the values of 2 are some of the divisors of r, which is the term left when you suppose nzo; and the talnes of the y\\'s are some of the divisors of -Tt-s-l-y T, and of ---I-¬-5--r, respectively. And these values are in arithmetical progression increasing by the common difference unit ; because wiI, N, NTI, are in that progression. And it is obvious the same reasoning may be extended to any cquation of whatever degree. So that this gives a general method for the resolution of equations whose roots are cemmensurable. RULE. Substitute, in palce of the unknown quantity, successively the terms of the progession, 1. 0. I. &c. and find all the divisors of the sums that result; then take out all the arithmetical progressions you canfind among these divisors, whose common difference is unit ; and the values of x will be among the divifors arising from the substitutions of xwo that belong to these progressions. the values of x will be affirmative when the arithmetical progression increases, but negative when it decreases. eL-LIINT-LIOK---T2 3N--PZZN-FIO.',\n  'graph': 'jour <?«d waste, in law, signifies a forfeiture of lands for a year and a day to the king, by persons committing petit treason and felony, and afterwards the land falls to the lord.',\n  'uri': 'https://w3id.org/hto/ArticleTermRecord/992277653804341_144133901_AN_0'},\n {'new': 'among physicians, denotes a quantity equal to that of the preceding ingredient.

BEFORE we examine the structure of the bones, the periosteum, a membrane with which they are covered, must be described. The periosteum can be divided into layers of sibres. The exterior ones, composed of the fibres of the muscles connected to the bones, vary in their number, size, and direction, and consequently occasion a very great difference in the thickness and strength of the periosteum of different bones. the internal layer is every where nearly of a similar structure, and has its sibres in the same direction with those of the bone to which they are contignous. Except where muscles, cartilages, or ligaments, are inserted into the periosteum, its external surface is connected to the furrounding parts by thin cellular membranes, which can easily be stretched considerably, but In treating this useful subject, we shall divide it into the following parts : I. Of the BONES. II. Of the MUSCLES. III. Of the ARTERIES. IV. Of the VEINS. V. Of the NERVSS. VI. Of such parts of the body as are not comprehended in any of the above, e. g.

Th e value of annuities for life is determined from ob; fervations made on the bills of mortality. Dr Halley, Mr Simpfon, and Monf. de Moivre, are gentlemen of. diftinguilhed merit in calculations of this kind. Dr Halley had recourse to the bills of mortality at Breflaw,. the capital of Silefia, as a proper standard for the .©tiier parts of Europe, being a place prettycentral, at a distance from the sea, and not much crowded with traffickers or foreigners-.. He pitches upon 1000 persons all born in one year, and obferveshow many of these were alive every year, from their birth tothe extinftion of the last,. and consequently how many died each year, as in the first of the following tables; which is well? adapted to Europe in general. But in the city of London, there-is observed to be a greater disparity in the births and burials than in any other place, owing probably to the vast resort of people thither, in the way of commerce, from all parts of the known world. Mr Simpfon, therefore, ip order to have a table particularly.. faitedisuited to this populous city, pitches upon 1280 persons all born in the same year, and records the number remaining alive each year, till none were in life. Dr Halley’s table on the bills of mortality at Breflaw. Mr Simpfon’s table on the bills of mortality at London. I T I E S. It may not be improper in this place to observe, that however perfeft tables of this sort may be in themselves, and however well adapted to any particular climate, yet the conclusions deduced from them muff always be uncertain, being nothing more than probabilities, or conjedtures drawn from the usual period of human life. And the practice of buying and selling annuities on lives, by rules founded on such principles,may be juflly conlidered as a sort of lottery or chance-work, in which the parties concerned mult often be deceived. But as eftimates and computations of this kind'are now become faftiionable, we fiiall here give some brief account of such as appear molt material. From the above tables the probability of the continuance or extindtion of human life is eltimated as follows. 1. The probability that a person of a given age lhall live a certain number of years, is measured by the proportion which the number of persons living at the proposed age has to thedifference between the said number and the number of persons living at the given age. Thus, if it be demanded, what chance a person of 40 years has to live seven years longer ? from 445, the number of persons living at 40 years of age in Dr Halley’s table, fubtradt 377, the number of persons living at 47 years of age, and the remainder 68, is the number of persons that died during these 7 years; and the probability or chance that the person in the queltion shall live these 7 years is as 377 to 68, or nearly as 5-! to 1. But, by Mr Simpfon’s table, the chance is some>thing less than that of 4 to 1. 2. If the year to which a person of a given age has an equal chance of arriving hefore' ' he dies, be required, it may be found thus : Find half the number of persons living at the given age in the tables, and in the column of age you have the year required. ’ Thus, if the quellion be put with refpedt to a person of 30 years of age,, the number of that age in Dr Hal ley’s table is 531, the half whereof is 265, which is found in the table' between 57 and 58 years ; so that a person of 30 years.has an equal chance of living between 27 and 28 years longer. 3. By the tables, the premium of insurance upon lives may in some measure be regulated. Thus, The chance that a person of 25 years has to live another year, is, by Dr Halley’s table, as 80 to 1 ; but the chance that a person of 50 years has to live a year longer is only 3010 1. And, consequently, the premium for insuring the former ought to be to the premium for insuring the latter for one year, as 30 to 80, or as 3 to 8. Puob. I. To find the value of an annuity of 11. for the life of a fmgle person of any given age. Monf. de Moivre, by obfervihg the decreale of the probabilities of life, as exhibited in the table, composed an algebraic theorem or canon, for computing the value of an annuity for life; which canon I lhall here lay down by way of Rule. Find the complement of life; and, by the tables, find the value of 11. annpity for the years denoted by the said complement; multiply this value by the amountof one pound for an age of 50 years, at 3 per cent, interest, is 12.51 ; that is, 12 1. 10 s. or twelve and a half years purchase. The marginal figures on the left of the column of age serve to shorten the table, and signify, that the value of an annuity for the age denoted by them, is the same with the value of an annuity for the age denoted by the numbers before which they stand. Thus the value of an annuity for the age of 9 and 10 years is the same; and the value of an annuity for the age of 6 and 14, for the age of 3 and 24, 'be. is the same. The lurcher use of the table will appear in the questions and problems following. Quest, i. A person of 50 years would purchase an annuity for life of 200 1: What ready money ought he to pay, reckoning inteteft at 44 per cent. ? L. By the table the value of 1 1. is 10.8 Multiply by 200 Value to be paid in ready money 2164.00 Anf. Quest. 2.

The mellesica, or honcy-bee, is furnished with downy hairs, a dusky-coloured breast, and brownish belly ; the tibiæ of the hind-legs are ciliated, and transversely streaked on the inside. Each foot of this bee terminates in two hooks, with their points opposite to each other ; in the middle of these hooks there is a little thin appendix, which, when unfolded, enables the bees to fasten themselves to glass or the most polished bodies. this part they likewise employ for collecting the small particles of wax whichthey find upon flowers, and for transmitting them to the middlemost joint of the two hinder feet, in which there is a little cavity, in the shape of a narrow spoon, surrounded by a number of hairs. When they have loaded their thighs with wax, they imnmediately carry it off to ahe hive. The qucen and drones, who never collect wax in this manner, have no such cavity. the belly of the bee is divided into six rings or joints. In the inside of the belly there is a small bladder or reservoir, in which the thoney is collected, after having passed through the proboscis and a narrow pipe which runs through the head. and breast. This bladder, when full of honey, is about the size of a small pea. The sting is situate at the extremity of the belly : It is a horny substance, and hollow within, for transmitting the venomous liquor, which lies in a bladder near the anus, into the wound. The sting is penerally left in the wound, and frequently draws after it the poison-bag. As the mellesica, or honey-bee, is both an useful insect, and endowed with peculiar instincts, we shall give a particular account of its nature and œconomy. The queen is the only female in a hive; she is distinguished from the others by being taller, more of an oblong figure, and having ten joints in each feeler. She is likewise furnished with a sting. The suci, males, or drones, are commonly about 1600 in a hive; they have no sting, and their feelers have eleven joints. the of eraria, spadones, or working bees, are sometimes 20,000 in a hive; they have fifteen joints in their feelers, and are armed with stings. After a new swarm is formed, the bees immediately begin to form their celis. They begin their work at the upper part of the hive, and continue it downwards, and foom one side to the other. It is not easy to discover the particular manner of their working ; for, notwithstanding the many contrivances used for this purpose, there are sach numbers in continual motion, and succeers one another with such rapidity, that nothing but consusion appears to the sight. Some of them however have been observed carrying pieces of wax in their talons, and running to the places where they are at work, upon the combs. These they fasten to the work by means of the same talons. Each bee is employed but a very short time in this way ; but there is so great a number of them that go on in a constant succession, that the comh increaes very perceptibly. Besides these, there are others that run about beating the work with their wings and the hinder part of their boly, probably with a view o make it more firm and solid. The order they observe in the construction of their cells is this : They begin with laying the basis, which is composed of three rhombus's or lozenges. They build first one of the rhombus's, and draw faces on two of its sides ; they then add a second rhombus to the first in a certain inclination, and draw two new faces on its two sides ; and, last of all, they add a third rhombus to the two first, and raie on the two external sides of this rhombus two other faces ; which completes the cell of an hexagonal figure. Whilst part of the bees are occupied in forming the cells, others are employed in persecting and polishing thoss that are new-modelled. This operation is performed by their talons, taking off every thing that is rough and uneyen. these polishers are not so desultory in their operations as those that make the cells; they work long and diligently, never intermitting their labour, ex bliet tnry the of a prihate, These prities ore anr allowed to be lost ; others are ready to receive them from the polishers, and to employ them in some other part of the work. Each comb has two rows of cells opposite to each other, which have their common bases. The thickness. of every comb is something less than an inch, and the depth of the cells is about five lines. Almost all the combs are built with cells of this size ; except a small number of a larger kind, that are destined for the worms that produce drones. The bases of all the combs are placed at such a distance from one another, that, when the cells are finished, there is only a space left sufficient for the passage of two bees abreast. These comhs are not continued from top to bottom, but are often interrupted, and have openings from one rassage to another, which give a more easy and shorter conminication. The queen-bee is generally concealed in the most secret part of the hive, and is never visible but when slus lays her eggs in such combs as are exposed to sight. When she does appear, she is always attended by ten or a dozen of the common fort, who form a kind of retinue and follow her where-ever she goes with a sedate and grave tread. Before she lays her eggs, she examines the cells where she designs to lay them ; and if she sinds that they contain neither honey, wax, nor any embrio, she introduces the posterior part of her body into a cell, and fixes to the bottom of it a small white egg, which is composed of a thin white membrane, full of a whitish liquor. In this manner she goes on, till she fills as many cells as she has eggs to lay, which are generally many housands. Ffter the engs lie four days in the cells, they appear in the form of small caterpislars ; and generally lic twisted round, so that the two extremities touch each other. the bees then supply them with a little honey for food, the quantity of which they increase till the eighth day from the birth of the caterpillar. After this, the bees discover no more care about their young; but top up the mouths of the cells with wax. the embrios tie in this state twelve days, during which time they undergo surrrising changes. they first change their situation in the cells, and instead of being rolled up, they extend themselves alone, and place their heads towardse the mouth of the cell ; after this, the head of the worm begins to have a small extension, which is the rudiment of the proboseis : Upon the head there is likewise a blackpoint, and at a little distance from this point, a black. streak upon the back : The first lineaments of the feet likewise appear; but they are very small. After the head is furmed, and the proboscis lengthened, all the other barts display themselves successively ; so that the whole vorm or embrio is changed into an aurelia or nymph, which is the fly almost perfect, except that it is yet white and foft, and wants that crust with which it is afterwards covered. By this transformation the worm is stripped of a white thin pellicle, which adheres to the sides of the rell. The young bee being stripped of this pellicle, and all the parts heing unfolded by degrees, and changed through successive colours from yellow to black, arrives Plate XXII.

When (he does appear, (lie is always attended by ten or a dozen of the common sort, who form a\\' kind of retinue, and follow her where-ever (he goes with a fedate and grave tread. Befor* (he lays her eggs, (he examines the cells where (He designs to lay them ; and if (he finds that they contain neither honey, wax, nor any embrio, (lie -introduces the poderior part of her body into a cell, and sixes to the bottom of it a small white egg, which is composed of a thin white membrane, full of a whitish liquor. In this manner (he goes on, till (lie fills as many cells as (he has eggs to lay, which are generally many thousands.

The embrios lie in this (late twelve days, during which time they, undergo surprising changes. They fird change their situation in the cells, and indead of being rolled up, they extend themselves along, and pl^ce their heads towards the mouth of the cell; after this, the head of the worm begins to have a small extension, which is the rudiment of the probofeis: Upon the head there is likewise a black point, and at a little didance from this point, a black dreak upon the back: The fird lineaments of the feet likewise appear; but they are very small. After the head is formed,, and the probofeis lengthened, all the other parts display themselves fucceflively; so that .the whole worm or embrio is changed into an aurelia or nymph, which is the fly almod perfeft, except that it is yet white and soft, and wants that crud\\'with which it is afterwards covered.

All the species of spiders have eight legs, with three joints in each, and terminating in three crooked claws ; eight eyes, two before, two behind, and the rest on the sides of the head. The mouth consists of two claws or talons, denticulated like a saw. A little below the point of the claw, there is a small hole, through which the spider emits a kind of poison. These claws are the weapons with which they kill flies, &c. for their food. The belly or hinder part is separated from the head and breast by a small thread-like tube. The skin or outer surface is a hard polished crust. Spiders have five tubercles or nipples at the extremity of the belly, whose apertures they can enlarge or contract at pleasure. It is through these apertures that they spin a glucy substance with which their bellies are full. They fix the end of their threads by applying these nipples to any substance, and the threads lengthen in proportion as the animal recedes from it. They can stop the issuing of the threads by contracting the nipples, and re-ascend by means of the claws on their feet, much in the same manner as some men warp us a rope. When the common house-spider begins her web, she generally chuses a place where there is a cavity, such as the corner of a room, that she may have a free passage on each side, to make her escape in case of danger. then she fixes one end of her thread to the wall, and passes on to the other side, dragging the thread along with her, (or rather the thread follows her as she proceeds), till she arrives at the other side, and there fixes the other end of it. Thus she passes and repasses, till she has made as many parallel threads as she thinks necessary for her purpose. After this, she begins again and crosses these by other parallel threads, which may be named the woofThese are the toils or snares which she prepares for entangling flies, and other small insects, which happen to light upon it. But, besides this large web, she generally weaves a small cell for herself, where she lies concealed watching for her prey. Betwixt this cell and the large web, she has a bridge of threads, which, by communicating with the threads of the large one, both give her early intelligence when any thing touches the weh, and enables her to pass quickly in order to lay hold of it. There are many other methods of weaving peculiar to different species of spiders. But, it tnd the purtietis acintiens of sides Linnæus enumerates 47 species of spiders, viz. 1.

In considering attentively the beauty of visible objeds, we difeover two kinds. The first may be termed intrinjic beauty, because it is difeovered in a Angle objed, without relation to any other. The second may be termed relative beauty, being founded on a combination of relative objeds. Architedure admits of both kinds. We ftvall •first give a few examples of relative beauty. The proportions of a door are determined by the use to which it is destined. The door of a dwelling-house, which ought to correspond to the human size, is confined to seven or eight feet in height, and three or four in breadth. The proportions proper for a stable or coachhoufe are different. The door of a church ought to be wide, in order to afford an easy passage for a multitude; and its height must be regulated by its wideness, that the proportion may please the eye.

It is variously contrived. That chiefly used in Europe is made by drawing any number of parallel lines at the distance of two dimneters of one of the counters used in the calulation. A counter placed on the lowest line, signifies r; on the 2d, 10; on the 3d, 100; on the 4th, 1000, &c. In the intermediate spaces, the same counters are estimated at one half of the value of the line immediately superior, viz. between the Ist and 2d, 5; between the 2d and 3d, 50, &c. See plate I. fig. 2.

This is also called a canon of sexagesimals. ABACUS Pythagoricus, the multiplication-table, or any table of numbers that facilitates operations in arithmetic.',\n  'graph': 'dows ought always to be proportioned to that of the room they are destined to illuminate; for if the aper tures be not large enough to convey light to every corner, the room mull be unequally lighted, which is a ^reat deformity. Steps of Hairs Ihould likewile be accommodated to the human figure, without regarding any other proportion; they are accordingly the same in large and in small buildings, because both are inhabited by men of the same lize. We shall next consider inlrinjtc beauty, blended with that which is relative. A cube in itself is more agreeable than a parallelopipedon ; this conllantly holds in small figures : But a large building in the form of a cube is lumpilh and heavy; while a parallelopipedon, set on its smaller base, is more agreeable on account of its elevation : Hence the beauty of Gothic towers. But if this figure were to be used in a dwelling-house, to make way for relative beauty, we would immediately perceive that utility ought chiefly to be regarded; and this figure, inconvenient by its height, ought to be set on its larger base: The loftiness in this caie would be lost; but that loss will be more than sufficiently compensated by the additional convenience. Hence the form of buildings spread more upon the ground than ra>fed in height, is always preferred for a dwelling-house. With regard to the internal divisions, utility requires that the rooms be re&angular, to avoid useless spaces. An hexagonal figure leaves no void spaces ; but it determines the rooms to be all of one size, which is both inconvenient and difigreeable for want of variety. Tho’ a cube be the moll agreeable figure, and may answer for a room of a moderate size; yet, in a very large room, utility requires a different figure. Unconfined motion is the chief convenience of a great room; to obtain this, the greatest length that.can be had is neceflary. But a square room of a large size is inconvenient. It removes chairs, tables, <bc. at too great a distance from the hand,, which, when unemployed, must be ranged along the sides of the room, Utility therefore requires a large room to be a parallellogram. This figure is likewise best calculated for the admifiion of light; because, to avoid cross Jights, all the windows ought to be in one wall; and if the opposite wall be at such a distance as not to be fully lighted, the room must be obscure. The height of a room exceeding nine or ten feet,, has little relation to utility ; therefore proportion is the only rule for determining the height, when above that number of feet. Arnfts who deal in the Beautiful, love to entertain the eye ; palaces and sumptuous buildings, in which intrinfic beauty may be fully displayed, give them an opportunity of exerting their taste. But such a propensity is peculiarly unhappy with regard to private dwelling-houses; •because in these, relative beauty cannot be displayed to perfeftion, without hurting, intrinfic beauty. There is no opportunity for great variety of form in a,small house ; and in edifices of this kind, internal convenience has not hitherto been happily adjusted to external regularity. Perhaps an accurate coincidence in -this refped is beyond the reach of art. Architects, however, constantly split upon this rock; for they never can be perluadcd to give over attempting to reconcile these two incompatibles: E C T U R E. 347 Plow otherwise ihould it happen, that of the endless variety of private dwelling-houi\\' es, there ihould not be one\\' found that is generally agreed upon as a good pattern ? The unwearied propensity to make a house regular as well as convenient, obliges the architect, in feme articles, to sacrifice convenience to regularity, and, in others, regularity to convenience; and accordingly the house, which turns out neither regular nor convenient, never sails to displease. Nothing can be more evident, than that the form of a dwelling-house ought to be suited to the climate; yet no error is more common than to copy in Britain the form of Italian houses, not forgetting even those parts that are purposely contrived for collecting air, and for excluding the sun: Witness our colonnades and logics, designed by the Italians to gather cool air, and exclude the beams of the sun, conveniencies which the climate of this country does not require. We ftiali next view architecture as one of the fine arts ; which will lead us to the examination of such buildings, and parts of buildings, as are calculated solely to please the eye. Variety prevails in the works of nature ; but. art requires to be guided by rule and compass. Hence it is, that in such works of art as imitate nature, the great art is, to hide every appearance of art; which is done by avoiding regularity, and indulging variety. But in. works of art that are original and not imitative, such as architecture, strict regularity and uniformity ought to be studied, so far as confident with utility. Proportion is not less agreeable than regularity and uniformity; and therefore, in buildings intended to please . the eye, they are all equally essential. It is taken for granted by many writers, that in all the parts of a building there are certain strict proportions which please the eye, in the same manner as in found there are certain ftri Cl proportions which please the ear; and that, in both, the slighted deviation is equally disagreeable. Others; seem to relilh more a comparison between proportion in numbers, and proportion in quantity; and maintain, that the same proportions are agreeable in both. The proportions, forexample, of the numbers 16, 24, and 36, are agreeable ; and so, say they,. are the proportions of a room, whose height is 16 feet,. the breadth 24, and the length 36. .But it ought to be considered, that there • is no refemblahce or relation between the obje Cls of different senses. What pleases the ear in harmony, is not the proportion of the firings of the instrument, but of the found which these firings produce. In architecture, on the contrary,; it is the proportion of different quantr ties : that pleases the eye, without the leaf! relation to. found. The same thing may be said of numbers; Quantity is a real quality of every body; number is not a real quality, but merely an idea that arises upon viewing a plurality of things in fucceflion. An arithmetical proportion is agreeable in numbers; but have we from this any reason to conclude, that it must also be agreeable in quantity ? At this rate, a geometrical ■ propor-. tion, and many others,, ought also to. be agreeable in both. A certain proportion may coincide in quantity, and number; and amongst an endless--variety of ,proportions, it would be wonderful if there never should be tu coincidence.-.coincidence. One example is given of this coincidence, an the numbers l6, 24, and 36 ; but to be convinced that it is merely accidental, we need but refled, that the same proportions are not applicable to the external figure of a •houle, and far less to a column. It is\\' ludicrous to observe writers acknowledging the necessity of accurate proportions, and yet differing widely about them. Laying aside reasoning and philosophy, one sad universally agreed on ought to have undeceived them, that the same proportions which please in a model are not agreeable in a large building: A room 48 feet ■ in length, and 24 in breadth and height, is well proportioned ; but a room 12 feet wide and high, and 24 long, approaches to a gallery. Perrault, in his comparison of the ancients and moderns, goes to the opposite extreme, maintaining, that the ,different proportions assigned to each order of columns are arbitrary, and that the beauty of these proportions is entirely the effed of custom. But he should have confl Jered, that if these proportions had not originally been agreeable, they could never have been effablifhed by cuffom. For illustrating this point, we fliall add a few examples of the agreeableness of different proportions. In a sumptuous edifice, the capital rooms ought to be large, otherwise they will not be proportioned to the size of the building; for the same reason, a very large room is improper in a small house. But in things thus related,_the mind requires not a precise or Angle proportion, rejeding all others; on the contrary, many different proportions are equally agreeable. It is only when a proportion becomes loose and diflant, that the agreeableness abates, and at last vanishes. Accordingly, in buildings, rooms of different proportions are found to be equally agreeable, even where the proportion is not influenced by -utility. With regard to the proportion the height of a room Ihould bear to the length and breadth, it muff be extremely arbitrary, considering the uncertainty of the eye as to the height of a room when*it exceeds 16 or 17 feet. In columns, again, every archited muff confess, that the proportion of height and thickness varies betwixt 8 diameters and 10, and that every proportion between these two extremes is agreeable. Besides, there muff certainly be a further variation of proportion, depending on the size of the column : A row of columns 10 feet high, and a row twice that height, requires different proportions: The intercolumniations muff allb differ in proportion according to the height of the row. Proportion of parts is not only itself a beauty, but is infeparably conneded with a beauty of the highest relish, that of concord and harmony ; which will be plain from what follows : A room, the parts of which are all finely adj uffed to each pther, strikes us not only with the beauty of proportion, hut with a pleasure far superior. The length, the breadth, the height, the windows, raise each of them a separate emotion: These emotions are similar; and,, though saint\\' when separately felt., they produce, in conjundion, the emotion of concord or harmony, which is very pleasant. On the other hand, where the length of a room far exceeds the breadth, the mind, comparing together parts so intimately conneded, immediately per E C T U R E. ceives a disagreement or disproportion which difgufts. Hence a long gallery, however convenient for exercise, is not an agreeable figure of a room. In buildings deflined chiefly or solely to please the eye, regularity and proportion are essentially necessary, because they are the means of producing intrinfic beauty. But a fldlful artist will not confine his view to regularity and proportion; he will also study congruity, which is perceived when the form and ornaments of a ftrudure are suited to the purpose for which it is appointed. Hence every building ought to have an expreflion suited to. its destination. \\' A palace ought to be sumptuous and grand; a private dwelling, neat and modest; a playhouse, gay and splendid; and a monument, gloomy and melancholy. A heathen temple has a double deflination: It is considered as a house dedicated to some divinity; therefore it ought to grand, elevated, and magnificent : It is also confidefed as a place of worship; and therefore’ ought to be somewhat dark and gloomy, because dimness or obscurity produces that tone of mind which is favourable to humility and devotion. Columns, besides their chief destination of being supports, contribute to .that peculiar expreflion which the destination of a building requires: Columns of different proportions serve to express loftiness, lightness, &C. as well as strength. Situation may also contribute to expreflion: Conveniency regulates the situation of a private dweliing-house; and the situation of a palace ought to be lofty. This leads to a question, Whether the situation, where there happens to be no choice, ought, in any measure, to regulate the form of the edifice ? The conne&ion between a great house and a neighbouring field, though not extremely intimate, demands however some congruity. It would, for example, displease us to find an elegant building thrown away upon a wild uncultivated country: Congruity requires a polished field for such a building. The old Gothic form of building was well suited to the rough uncultivated regions where it was invented ; but was very ill adapted to the fine plains of France and Italy. The external ftruflure of a house leads naturally to its internal ftrudure. A large and spacious room, which is the first that commonly receives us, is a bad contrivance in several refpeds. In the first place, when immediately from the open air we step into such a room, its ftze in appearance is diminished by contrast; it looks little, compared with the great canopy of the sky. In the next place, when at recovers its grandeur, as it soon doth, it gives a diminutive appearance to the rest of the house. palling from it, ev6ry apartment looks little. In the third place, by its situation it serves only for a waiting-room, and a passage to the principal apartments. Rejeding therefore this form, a hint may be taken from the climax in writing for another that appears more suitable: A handsome portico, proportioned to the size and fashion of the front, leads into a waiting-room of a larger size, and this to the great room, all by a progression from small to great. Grandeur is the principal emotion that architedure is capable of raising in the mind: it might therefore be the chief study of the artist, in great buildings destined toto please the eye. But as grandeur depends partly on lize, it is unlucky for ardiite&ure that it is governed by regularity and proportion, which never deceive the eye by making objects appear larger than they are in reality. But though regularity and proportion contribute nothing to grandeur, so far as that emolion depends on size ; yet they contribute greatly to it by confining the size within such bounds that it can be taken in and examined at one view; for, when objedts are so large as not to be comprehended but in parts, they tend rather to diftradt than satisfy the mind. We fiiall next pass to Tuch ornaments as contribute to give buildings a peculiar expression. It has been doubted, whether a building can regularly admit any ornament but what is useful, or at least has that appearance. But, considering the double aim of architedture as a fine, as well as an useful art, there is no reason why ornaments may not be added to please the eye, without any relation to utility. A private dwelling-house, it.is true, and other edifices, where use is the chief aim, admit not regularly any ornament but what has\" at least the appearance of use : But temples, triumphal arches, and other buildings intended chiefly or solely for ftiow, may be highly ornamented. This suggests a division of ornaments into three kinds, l viz. x. Ornaments that are beautiful without relation to use; such as statues, vafes, baflbor alto relievo : 2. Things in themselves not beautiful, but poflefling the beauty of utility, by imposing on the fpedtator, and appearing to be useful ; such\\' as blind windows : • Where things are beautiful in themselves,«and at the same time take on the appearance of use; such as pilasters. Witfi regard to the Jir J}, we naturally require that a statue be so placed, as to be seen in every diredtion, and examined at different distances. Statues, therefore,, are properly introduced to adorn the great stair that leads to to the principal door of a palace, or to lessen the void between pillars. But a niche in the external front is an improper place for a statue. There is-an additional reason against placing them upon the roof or top of the walls; their r\\' cklifh situation gives pain, as they have the appearance of being in danger of tumbling down ; besides, we are inclined to feel from their being too much exposed to the inclemencies of the weather. To adorn the top of the wall with a row of vafes, is an unhappy conceit, by placing a thing, whose natural destination is utility, where it cannot have even the appearance of use. As to carvings upon the external surface of a building, termed bajfo relievo \\' when flat, and alto relievo when prominent, all contradidtory exprefiions ought to be avoided. Now, firmness and solidity being the proper expreflions of a pedestal, and, on the contrary, lightness and delicacy of carved work, the pedestal, whether of a column or of a statue, ought to be sparingly ornamented. The ancients never ventured any bolder ornament than the baflb relievo. With refpedt to-ornaments df thefecond kind, it is a great blunder to contrive them so as to make them appear useless. A blind window, therefore, when neceflary for regularity,, ought to be so disguised as to appear a real window: When it appears without disguise, it is difguftVol*. I. Numb. 15. E C T U R E. 349 ful, as a vain-attempt to supply the want of invention ; it Ihows the irregularity in a stronger light, by signifying that a window ought to be there in point of regularity, but that the architedt had notfkill (uflicient to connedl external regularity with internahconvCnience. As to xhe third, it is an error to sink pilasters so far into the wall, as to remove totally, or mostly, the appearance of use. They ilxould always projedt so mucir from the wall, as to have the appearance of supporting the entablature over them. From ornaments in general, we defeend to a pillar^ the chief ornament in great buildings. The ideftination of a pillar is to support, really or in appearance, another part termed the entablature. With regard to the form of a pillar, it must be observed, that a circle is a more agreeable figure than a square, a globe than\\' a cube, and a cylinder than a parallellopipedon. This last, in the language of architedture, is saying, that a column is a more agreeable figure than a pilafter; and for that reason it ought to be preferred, when all other, circumstances are equal. Another reason concurs, that a column annexed to a wall, which is a plaip surface, makes a greater variety than a*pilafter. Besides, pilasters at a distance are apt to be mistaken for pillars ; and the fpedtator is disappointed when, on a nearer approach, he difeovers them to b V only pilasters. As to the parts of a column, a bare uniform cylinder, without a capital, appears naked; and without a bate, appears too -ticklifhly placed to stand firm j It ought therefore to have some finiflxing at the top and bottom: Hence the three chief parts of a column, the flxaft, the base, and the capital. Nature undoubtedly requires proportion among these parts, but it admits of variety of proportion. Vitruvius and some of the elder writers seem to think, that the proportions of columns were derived from the human figure, the capital representing the head, the base the feet, and the fliaft the body. The Tuscan has been -accordingly denominated the Gigantic ; the Doric, the Herculean; the Ionic, the Matronal ; and the Corinthian, the Virginal:—the Cbmpofite is a mixture of the Corinthian and Ionic. As to the-base, the principle of utility interposes to vary it from the human figure, and to proportion it so to the whole, as to give the column the appearance of liability. Among the Greeks, we find only three orders of columns, the Doric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian, diftinguiflred from each other by their fteftination as well as by their ornaments. It has been disputed, whether any new order can be added to these : Some hold the affirmative, and give for instances the Tuscan and Compofite ; others maintain, that these properly are not diftihtf: orders, but only the original orders with some flight variation. The only circumstances that can serve to diftinguifli one order from another, are the form of the column, and its destination. To make the first a diftinguiffiing mark without regard to the other, would multiply orders without end. Destination is more limited, and it leads us to diftinguifti three kinds of orders ; one plain and strong, for the purpose of supporting plain and mafly buildings ; one delicate and graceful, for supporting buildings of that charafier; and between these, a 4 T _ _ third,third, supporting buildings of a mixed nature. So that, if domination alone is to be regarded, the Tufcands of the same order with the Doric, and the Com polite with the Corinthian. The ornaments of these three orders ought to be Hiked to the purposes for which they are intended. Plain and rulhc ornaments would be not a little discordant with the elegance of the Corinthian order, and sweet and delicate ornaments not less with the strength of the Doric. With refpedt to buildings of every kind, one rule, ditfhted by utility, is, that they be firm and liable. An S E C OF ARCHITECTURE AS Of the Origin o/’Buildings. \"O Uixdings, in the first ages of society, behoved to be extremely rude. The first huts were probably of a conic figure, being the most simple, and belt adapted to the materials that could be obtained in such an uncultivated state of society. These huts were formed of branches of trees, covered with reeds, leaves, and clay. But, finding the conic figure inconvenient, on account of its inclined sides, they changed it into a cubical one, in -the following manner: They fixed in the ground several upright trees to form the lides, filling the intervals between them with branches closely interwoven, and covered with clay. The lides being thus compleated, four large beams were placed on the upright trunks, which, being well joined at the angles, kept the sides firm ; and likewise served to support the roof, which was composed of many joifts, covered with reeds, leaves, and clay. As men improved in the art of building, new methods of rendering their huts lasting and handsome were gradually invented. Thfy took off the bark and other unevennefies from the trunks of the trees that formed the lides, and raised them above the dirt on stones. The spaces between the ends of the joifts were closed with clay, and the ends of them were covered with thin boards, cut in the form of triglyphs, «Sr<r. From this simple conftr.u&ion the different orders of architedhire took their rise. When buildings of wood were laid aside, they imitated, in their edifices of stone, vhe form which necessity had introduced into the primitive huts: Hence the upright trees gave rise to the columns ; and the beams, joifts, rafters, and strata of materials that formed the covering, suggested architraves, frizes, triglyphs, and cornices. At what time, or by whom, the Grecian orders were invented, is not certainly known. But the following is the account which Vitruvius gives of them. Dprus, king of Achaia, and son of Helenes and Optica, built a temple to Juno in the ancient city of Argos, which happened to be in the manner now called Doric, from the name of the inventor. This manner was afterwards imitated in many other temples in the several cities of Achaia. E C T U R E. other, dictated by beauty, is, that they also appear so to the eye ; for every thing that appears tottering, and in hazard of tumbling down, produceth in the fpedtator the painful emotion of fear, instead of the pleasing emotion of beauty; and accordingly it should be the great care of the artist, that every part of his edifice appear to be well supported. Some have introduced a kind of conceit in architedlure, by giving parts of buildings the appearance of falling; of this kind is the church of St Sophia in Constantinople; the ro\\\\md towers in the uppermost stories of Gothic buildings is in the same false taste. T. II. A MECHANICAL ART. The Athenians, about the same time, sent thirteen colonies into Alia, under the cqmmand of Ion, son of Xuthus and Creufa. This Ion conquered all Caria, founded many cities, and called the country Ionia. The firlt temple he built was after the Doric manner. But afterwards he built a temple to Diana of a more delicate structure, and formed upon the proportions of a female body, as the Doric had been on those of a robust man. The capital was adorned with volutes, to represent the curls of a woman’s hair; and flutingswere cut on the Ihaft of the column, in imitation of the folds of her garment. This order got the name of Ionic, in honour of the lonians who invented it. The third sort of columns, called Corinthian, are said to owe their origin to the following accident:—A young girl of Corinth having died, her nurse placed on her tomb a balket, containing certain trinkets, in which she delighted wh£n alive, and covered it with a tyle to prevent the rain from spoiling them. The balket happened to be placed on a root of acanthus, which pushing out its leaves in the spring, covered the sides of the balket; some of the longest of which, being obftrudted by the corners of the tyle, were forced downwards, and curled in the manner of volutes. Calimachus the fculptor, passing near the tomb, was so pleased with the beautiful appearance of the acanthus growing in this manner, that he imitated it in the columns which he afterwards made at Corinth. Villalpandus treats this story of Calimachus as a sable, and maintains that the Corinthian capital took its origin from an order in Solomon’s temple; and it must be acknowledged, that some descriptions in the Bible favour this opinion. Besides these three orders, said to be invented by the Greeks, two other, viz. the Tufcanand Compofite, are thought to have been invented by the Romans. The Tuscan first appeared in Tuscany, before the Romans had any intercourse with the Greeks. The Compofite is a mixture of the Ionic\\' and Corinthian. These five manners of building, invented by the ancients, are called Orders, on account d£ the regularity and beauty of their forms. Ofthe Farts that compose an Order, and The parts that compose an ordef may be distributed into two different classes. In the firji may be ranged all that have^any analogy to the primitive huts, and represent i\\' ome part that was necessary in their conftiudion. Such are the draft of the column, with the plinth of its base, and the abacus of its capital, representing the upright trees, with the (tones on which they were placed, and those that covered them ; likewise the architrave and triglyphs, representing the beams and joifts ; the mutules, modilions, or dentils, which all of them represent the rafters, or some other pieces of timber used to support the covering; and the corona, representing the beds of materials that composed the covering. All these may properly be diftinguilhed by the name of essential members. The fubfervient parts, contrived for the use or ornament of the former, and commonly called mouldings, may conftitute the fecund class. There are eight regular mouldings in ornamenting columns ; the fillet, Mel, or square; the aftragal, or bead; the torus, or tore; the scotia, mouth, or casement; the echinus, ovolo, or quarter-round; the inverted cyma, talon, or ogee; the cyma, cyma refta, or cymatium ; the cavetto, or hollow. The names of these allude to their forms, and their forms are adapted to the purposes for which they are intended. See Plate XXVII. The ovolo and talon, as they are strong at the extremities, are sit for supports ; the cyma and cavetto,. tho\\' improper for supports, serve for coverings to (belter other members; the torus and aftragal, being (haped like ropes, are intended to bind and fortify the parts with which they are conne&ed: But the use of the scotia and fillet. Is only to separate and diftinguifli the other mouldings, to give a graceful turn to the profile, and to prevent the confusion which would arise from joining several curved members together. There are various methods of describing the contours of moulding*; but the fimplelt and bed is to form them of quadrants of circles, as in Plate XXVII. An assemblage of what are. called essential parts and mouldings, is termed a prcfile. The most perfeft profiles are such as are composed of few mouldings, varied in form and size; and so disposed, that the streight and curved ones succeed each other alternately. When ■ ornaments are employed in. mouldings, some of them (hould be left plain, in order to give a proper repose : For, when all are ornamented, the figure of the profile is lost. Of the Orders of Architecture. An Order consists of two principal members, the Column and the Entablature; each of which is compqfed of three principal parts. Those of the Coturn,i are, the Base, the Shaft, and the Capital-, and those of the Entablature are, Jr chit rave, the Fr/a.?, and the Cornice. All these are (ubdivided into many lesser parts, whose number, form, and dimensions chara&erife each order, and express the degree of (trength, delicacy, richness, or simplicity peculiar to it. i. OF THE TUSCAN. The Tuscan (Plate XXIV.) is the most: solid and simple of all the orders. It is composed of few parts, devoid of ornaments, and so massy, that its seems capable of supporting the heaviest burden. There are no remains of a regular Tuscan order among the antiques ; the dodtrine of Vitruvius concerning it is obscure; and the profiles of Palladio, Scamozzi, Serlio, de P Orme, and Vignola, are all imperfeA. The. height of the Tuscan column is 14 modules,or femidiameters, each confiding of 3,0 minutes; aud that of the whole entablature 3modules ; which being divided into 10 equal parts, three of them’ are for the height of the architrave, three for the freeze, and the remaining four for the cornice t The capital is one module ; the base, including the lower cincture of the (hast, is likewise one module;, and die (hast, with its upper cindture and aftragal, 12 modules. These are the general dimensions of the order; the particular dimensions may be learned by inlpedtion of the In the remains of antiquity, the quantity of diminution at the top of the Tuscan column is various; but seldom less than one eighth, nor more than one sixth of the inferior diameter of the column. The last of these is generally preferred; and Chalmers and others make “the same diminution in all columns, without regard to their 2. OF THE DORIC ORDER. The Doric Order, (Plate XXV.) is next in strength to the Tuscan; and being of a grave, robust, and mafeuline afpedt, is by Scamozzi called the Herculean. As it is the most ancient of all. the orders, it retains more of the (trudture of the primitive huts than any of the rest ; the triglyphs m its freeze representing the ^nds of the joifts ; and the mutules in its cornice, repre The height of the Doric column, including its capita! and base, is 16 modules, and the height of the entablature four; the latter of which being divided into eight parts, two of them are for the architrave, three for the fuze, and three for the cornice.. ‘ In most of the antiques, the Doric column is executed, without a base. Vitruv ius likewise makes it without one ; the base, according to him, having been first employed in the Ionic order, in imitation of the sandal of a woman’s foot. Scamozzi blames this pradfice, and most: of the modern architedfs are of his Opinion. In the profile of the theatre of Marcellus, the frize is enriched with hulks and roses; the architrave consists only of one fafeia and a fillet; the drops are conical;, the metope is enriched with a bull’s (ku U, adorned with a garland of beads, in imitation of those on the temple of Jupiter Tonans at the foot of the Capitol. In feme antique fragments, and in a great many mordern buildings, the metopes are alternately adorned with ox-(kulls and pateras. But they may be filled with any other ornaments, according to the tkftination of the,building.3 . OF THE IONIC ORDER. Tke Ionjc Order (Plate XXVL) xsof anioreflender make than the Doric or Tufcan; its appearance is simple, yet^raceful andmajeftic; its ornaments are few; so that it has been compared to a fedate matron, in decent, rather than magnificent attire. Among the ancients, the form, of the Ionic profile appears to have been more positively determined than that of any other order; for, in all the antiques at Rome, (the temple of Concord excepted) it is exadtly the same. The modern aftifb have likewise been unanimous in their opinions; all of them, excepting Palladio and his imitators, having employed the dentil, cornice, and the other parts of the profile, nearly as they are found in the Collifeum, the temple of Fortune, and the theatre of Maro.Hus. The height of the Ionic column is 18 modules, and that of the entablature or one quarter of the height of the column, as in the other orders, which is a trifle less than in any of the antique Ionics.. In all the antiques, the base is Attic; and the lhaft of the column may either be plain, or fluted with 24 flutings, or 20 only, as in the temple of Fortune. The plan, of the flutings may be a trifle more than, a semicircle, as in the forum of Nerva, because they then appear more diflind. The fillets, ior intervals between them, must not be broader than one third of the breadth of a fluting, nor narrower than one fourth. The ornaments of the capital must correspond with the flutings of the shaft; and there must be an ove above the middle of each fluting. The volutes ought to be traced according to Mr Goldman’s method, which is as follows : Plate XXVII. fig. 9. Draw the cathetus F C, whose length must be 15 minutes, or one fourth of a module ; and, from the point C, describe the eye of the volute A E B D, of which the diameter is to be 6-fminutes; divide it into four equal feftors by the diameters AB, DE. Bifett the radii C A, C B, in 1 and 4; and on. the line 1, 4, conftrudt a square 1, 2, 3, 4. From the centre C, to the angles 2, 3, draw the diagonals C 2, C 3, and divide the side of the square 1, 4, into 6 equal parts, at 5, 9, C, 12, 8. Then through the points 5, 9, 12, 8, draw the lines 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 11, 8, 7, parallel to the diameter E D, which will cut the diagonals in 6, 7, 10, ii ; and the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, will be the centres of the volute. From the first centre 1, with the distance 1 F, describe the quadrant F G; from the second centre 2, with the distance 2\\'G, describe the quadrant G H; and, continuing the same operation from all the 12 centres, the eontour of the volute will be completed. Fig. 10. The centres for describing the fillet are found in this manner. Conftrudt a triangle, of which the side A F is equal to the part of the cathetus contained between A F and the side F V, equal to C 1 ; place the distance F S from F towards A, equal to F S the breadth of the fillet, and through the point S draw the line S T, which will be to C 1 in the same proportion as A S is to A F; place this line on the diameter of the eye A B ; E C T U RE. divide it into three equal parts ; and, through the points of division, draw lines parallel to the diameter E D, which will cut the diagonals C\\' 2, C 3, and you will have twelve new centres, from whence the interior contour of the fillet may be described, in the same manner as the exterior one was from the first centres. 4. OF THE CORINTHIAN ORDER. The proportions of this order are extremely delicate. It is divided into a great variety of members, and enriched with a profusion of ornaments. Scamozzi calls it.the virginal order) and indeed it has all the delicacy in its make, and all the gaiety in its dress, peculiar to young girls. See Plate XXVIII. The most perfect model of the Corinthian order is generally allowed to be in the three columns in the Campo Vaccino at Rome, the remains, as it is thought, of the temple of Jupiter Stator, The Corinthian column should be20 modules high, and the entablature 5 ; which proportions are a medium between those of the Panthreon and the three columns. The base of the column may either be Attic or Corinthian : They are both beautiful. If the entablature be enriched, the shaft may be fluted. The flutings may be filled, to one third of their height, with cablings, as in the inside of the Panthaeon ; which will strengthen the lower part of the column, and make it less liable to injury. In most of the antiques at Rome, the capital of this order is enriched with olive-leaves; the acanthus being seldom employed but in the Compofite. De Cordemoy, however, prefers the .acanthus. The divisions of the entablature bear the same proportions to each other, as in the Tuscan, Ionic, and Compofite orders. 5. OF THE COMPOSITE. The Composite is, ftridtly speaking, only a species of the Corinthian; and therefore retains, in a great measure, the same charadter. See Plate XXIX. It does not appear that the ancients affedted any particular form of entablature to this order. Sometimes the cornice is entirely plain, as in the temple of Bacchus; at others, as in the arch of Septimius Severus, it is enriched with dentils differing very little from the Ionic ; and in the arch of Titus, there are both dentils and modilions ; the whole Tomr of the profile \\' being the same with the Corinthian, as executed in the antiques at Rome. The modern architedts have varied more in this than in any other order, each following the bent of his own fancy. The height of the Gompofite column, and parts of the entablature, is the same with that of the Corinthian. The foot of the leaves of the capital ought not to projedt beyond the upper part of the shaft. The different bunches of leaves should be strongly marked; the sprigs which arise between the upper ones should be kept flat upon the vafe; and the ornaments of the volutes must not projedt beyond the fillets that inclose them.M O \" i /•; : *? OF PILASTERS. Pilasters dif Fer from columns only in their plan ; which is square, as that of columns i» round. Their b’afes, capitals, and entablatures, have the same parts, with the same heights and projections, as those of columns : They are also distinguished in the same manner, by the names of Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Compofite. The column is undoubtedly more perfect than the pilafter. However, they may be employed with great propriety on many occasions. Some authors declaim against pilasters, because, according to them, they do not admit of diminution. But this is a mistake; there are many instances, in the remains of antiquity, of their being diminiihed. Seamozzi always gave his pilasters the same diminution as his columns : Palladio and Inigo Jones have likewise diminiihed thedi in. many of their buildings. Pilasters are employed in churches, galleries, halls, and other interior decorations, to save room; for, as they seldom proje A beyond the solid wall above one quarter ©f their diameter, they do not occupy near so much space as .columns. They are likewise used in exterior decorations ; sometimes alone, instead of columns, on account of their being less expensive; and sometimes they accompany columns, being placed behind them to support the architraves, where they enter the building, as in the Panthseon at Rome; or, in the same line with them, to fortify the angles, as in the portico of Septimius. When \\' pilasters are used alone, they should project one quarter of their diameter beyond the walls. When placed behind columns, especially if they be very near them, they need not project above one eighth of their diameter. But, when placed on a line with columns, their projection mull be regulated by that of the columns ; and consequently, it can never be dess than a femidiameter, even when the columns are engaged as much as poflible. . The lhafts of pilasters are frequently adorned with flutings, in the same manner as those of columns; the plan of which may be a trifle more than a semicircle : Their number must be seven on each face, which makes them nearly of the same size with those of columns. The intervals, or fillets, must either be one third or one fourth of the fluting in breadth. C J The capitals of pilasters are profiled nearly in the same manner as those of columns. OF PERSIANS AND CARYATIDES. Besides columns and pilasters, it is sometimes customary to employ representations of the human figure, to support entablatures in buildings. The male figures are called Perjians; and the female. Curt a ns, ox Caryatides. The ancients made frequent use of Perfians and Caryatides,and delighted in diverfifying them a thousand ways. The modern artists have followed their example ; and there is a great variety of compositions of this kind to be met with in different parts of Europe. Vol. I. No. 15. 3 E C T TJ R E. \\' 353 Indecent attitudes, distorted features, and all monstrous productions, ought to be avoided, of which there are many examples in Gothic biuldings. On the contrary, the attitudes should be simple and graceful, the countenance always pleasing, though varied and strongly marked agreeable to the nature of the obje Ct represented. The Caryatides, or female figures, ftiould never much exceed the human size. But the Perfians, or male figures, may be of any size; and the larger the better, as they will strike the beholder with the greater awe and\\' aftoniftiment. Perfians may be used with propriety in arfenals, galleries of armour, tec. under the figures of captives, heroic virtues, <bc. Their entablature ought to be Doric, and bear the same proportion to them as to columns of the same height. The entablature for Caryatides ought to be either Ionic or Corinthian, according as the character of the figures is more or less delicate. Termini are sometimes employed, instead of Perfians or Caryatides, to support the entablatures of monuments, chimney-pieces, and such like compositions. These figures owe their origin to the stones used by the ancients to mark the limits of particular poffeflions. Numa Pompilius, to render these inviolable, consecrated the terminus into a deity, and instituted festivals and sacrifices to his honour. In a ftiort time, what was formerly only large upright stones, were represented in human shape ; and afterwards introduced as ornaments to temples and other buildings. The termini are now principally used as ornaments for gardens and fields. OF PEDESTALS. Most writers consider the Pedestal as a necessary part of the order/ without which it is not complete. It is indeed a matter of little importance whether it be considered in that light, or as a distinct composition : We ftiall therefore treat of a pedestal as a distinct body, having no more connection with the order than an Attic,-a basement, or any other part with which it may on feme occasions be associated. A pedestal consists of three principal parts ; the base, the dye, and the cornice. The dye is always nearly, of the same figure; being constantly either a cube or a parallelopipedon: But the base and cornice are varied and adorned with more or fewer mouldings, according to the simplicity or richness of the composition in which the pedestal is employed. Hence pedeftals are, like columns, distinguished by the names of Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Coripthian, and Compofite. Some authors are averse to pedeftals, and compare a column raised on a pedestal to a man mounted on stilts; imagining that they were introduced merely from necessity, and for want of columns of a sufficient length. It is indeed true, that the ancients often made use of artifices to lengthen their columns ; as appears by some that are in the Baptiftery of Constantine at Rome ; the shafts of which being too short for the building; were lengthened and joined to their bases by an undulated sweep, adorned with acanthus leaves. Nevertheless, there are maay occasions where pedeftals are evidently necessary; and\\' some in which the order, were it not so raised, would 4 U lose354 lose much of its beautiful appearance. Thus, in the. insides of churches, if the columns that support the vault were placed immediately on the ground, the seats would hide their bases, anc L a good part of their (hafts ; and, jn the theatres of the ancients, if the columns of the scene had been placed immediately on the stage, the a<3ors would have hid a part of them from the audience. In interior decorations, a pedestal diminilhes the parts of the order, which otherwise might perhaps appear too clumsy, and hath the advantage of placing the column in a more favourable view, by raising its base nearer the level of the fpe&ator’s eye. In a second order of area-des, there is no avoiding pedeftals; as without them it is impoflible to gives the arches any tolerable proportion. With regard to the proportion that pedeftals ought to bear to that of the columns they support, it is by no means fixed. Both the ancients and moderns vary greatly on this head. Vignola’s proportions are generally reckoned the best. He makes his pedeftals, in all the orders, of the same height, viz. one third of the column ; and as their breadth of course increases or diminifties in the same degree as the diameters of their respective columns do, the character of the order is always preserved, which, according to any other method, is i.mpoflible. As to the divisions of the pedestal; if the whole height be divided into nine parts, one of them may be given to the height of the cornice, two to the base, and the six remaining to the dye. The breadth of the dye is always made equal to that of the plinth of the column. The projeftion pf the cornice may be made equal to its height; and the base being divided into three parts, two of them will be for the height of the plinth, and one for the mouldings, whose projection must be less than that of the cornice. These measures are common to all pedeftals. See Plate XXX. OF IN T E RCOLUMNIATIONS. Columns are either engaged, or insulated; and, when insulated, are either very near the wall, or at a considerable distance from it. Engaged columns, or such as are near the walls of a building, are not limited in their intercolumniations, as these depend on the breadths of the arches, windows, niches, or other decorations placed between the columns. But columns that are entirely detached, and perform alone the office of supporting the entablature, as in periftyles, porches, and galleries, must be near each other, for the sake both of real and apparent solidity. _ The intercolumniations among die ancients were various. Those used in the Ionic and Corinthian orders were the pycnoftyle, of which the interval was equal to one diameter and a half of the column; the fyftyle, whose interval was equal to two diameters; the euftyle, tp two and a quarter ; the diaftyle to three, and the arasoftyle to four. In the Doric order, they used other intercolumniations, regulating them by the triglyphs,, one of which was always placed dire Ctly over the middle of each column ; so that they were either fyftyle, monotriglyph, of one diameter and a half; diaftyle, of two diameters and three quarters ; or araeoftyle, of four diameters ; and the Tuscan intervals were very wide, some pf them being above seven diameters,\\'which was very pra&icable, as the architraves were of wood. Among these different intercolumniations, the pycnoftyle and fyftyle are too narrow; for although the ancients ma^e frequent use of them, that ought rather to be aferibed to necessity than choice. For, as the archiiraves were composed of Angle stones, extending from the middle of pne column to the middle of another, it would have been difficult, especially in large buildings, to find blocks of a sufficient length for diaftyle intervals. With regard to the arasoftyle and Tuscan intercolumniations, they are by much too wide, and can only be used in rustic buildings, where the architraves are of wood; neither is the diaftyle fufljciently foiid in large compositions. The euftyle is a medium between the narrow and broad intervals; and, being at the same time both spacious and foiid, hath been preferred to any of the rest by the ancients as well as the moderns. Vignola observed nearly the same proportion in all his intercolumniations; which practice, though condemned by several writers, is certainly preferable to any other ; as it preftrves the char after of each order, and maintains in all of them an eqpal degree of real solidity. Setting aside therefore the pycnoftyle and fyftyle dispositions on account of their want of space, and the arseoftyle for its deficiency in point of strength, it may be eftablilhed, that the diaftyle and euftyle intercolumniations, (the latter of which, on most occasions, ought to have the preference), may be employed in all the orders without diftinftion, excepting the Doric ; in whiclt the most perfeft interval is ditriglyph; neither the monotriglyph, nor the arseoftyle, being to be suffered but in cases of neceflity. Sometimes, on account of the windows, doors, niches, and other decorations, which correspond with the inter* columniations of the periftyle, or gallery, it is not polfible to make the intervals so narrow as euftyle, or even as diaftyle : Wherefore the moderns, authorised by some few examples of the ancients, where grouped columns are employed, have invented a manner of disposing them, called by Perrault araojiyle, which admits of a larger interval, without any detriment to the apparent solidity of the building, This kind of dilpofition is composed of two fyftyle intercolumniations; the column that separates them being approached towards one of those at the extremities, sufficient room only being left between them for the projeftion of the capitals; so that the great space is three diameters and a half wide, and the little one half a diameter. In periftyks, galleries, or porticos, all the intercolumniations must be equal: But in a logic,, or porch, the middle interval may be broader than the others, by a triglyph or modilion, or three or four dentils; unless the columns at the angles be coupled, or grouped with pilasters; in which case, all the intervals should be of the same dimensions. When buildings are very fmalfi as is frequently the case in temples and other inventions used for ornamenting gardens, the intercolumniations may be broader, in proportion to the diameter of the columns, than usual; be.cause.cause, when they are nearer each other than three feet, there is hardly room for a bulky person to pass between them. OF ARCHES. Arches are not lb magnificent as colonnades; but they are more solid, and Ids expensive. They are proper for triumphal entrances, gates of cities, of palaces, of gardens, and of parks; and, in general, for all openings that require an extraordinary breadth. There are various manners of adorning arches. Sometimes their piers are rufticated; sometimes they are adorned with pilasters, termini, or caryatides; and sometimes they are made sufficiently broad to admit niches, or windows. The circular part of the arch is either furroundcd with rustic key-stones, or with an archivolt enriched with mouldings; which, in the middle, is sometimes interrupted by a console, a malk, serving at the same time as a key to the arch, and as a support to the architrave of the order. The archivolt is sometimes supported by an import, at the head of the pier; and, at others, by columns placed on each side of it, with a regular entablature, dr architrave cornice. There are likewise inrtances of arcades without piers, the arches being turned on single columns, as in the temple of Faunus at Rome, eirc. This pra&ice, however, ought to be seldom imitated, as it is neither solid nor handsome. When arches are large, the key-stone ftiould never be omitted, but cut in the form of a console, and carried close under the foffit of the architrave, which, on account ef its extraordinary length, requires a support in the middle. The imports of arches should never be omitted; at least, if they be, a platform ought to supply their place. If columns are employed without pedertals in arcades, they should always be railed on a plinth. In all arches, the circular part ought not to spring immediately from the import, but take its rise at such a distance above it, as is necefiary in order to have the whole curve seen at the proper point of view. The void or aperture of arches should never be higher* nor much lower, than double their breadth ; the breadth of the pier should seldom: exceed two thirds, nor be less than one third, of the breadth of the arch ; and the angular pier ought to be broader than the others,, by one half, one third, or one fourth; the import should not be more than one seventh, nor less than one ninth of the aperture; and the archivolt must not be more than one eighth, nor less than one tenth of it. The breadth of the console must, at the bottom, be equal to that of the archivolt; and its sides must be drawn from the centre of the arch: The length of it must not be less than one and a half of its smallest breadth, nor more than double. The thickness of the pier depends on the breadth of the portico; for it must be strong enough to resist the pressure df its vault. But, with regard to the beauty of the building, it should not be less than one quarter o F the breadth of the arch, nor more than one third. These are the general dimensions of arches. OF ORDERS ABOVE ORDERS. Wh en, in a building, two or more orders are employ* 355 ed, one above another, the laws of solidity require, the strongest should be placed lowermoft. Hence the Tuscan must support the Doric, the Doric the Ionic, the Ionic the Compofite or Corinthian, and the Compofite the Corinthian. This rule, however, is not always ftri<ftly adhered to. Most-authors place the Compofite above the Corinthian. There are likewise examples where the same order is repeated, as in the theatre of Statilius Taurus, and the Colifeum ; and others, where an intermediate order is omitted, and the Ionic placed on the Tuscan, or the Corinthian on the Doric. But none of these piaftices ought to be imitated. In placing columns above one another, the axis of all the columns ought to correspond, or be in the same perpendicular line, at least in front. With regard to the proportions of columns placed above each other, Scamozzi’s rule, That the lower diameter of the superior column should constantly be equal to the upper diameter of the inferior one, is universally esteemed the best, and gives all the columns the appearance ©f one long tapering tree, cut into several pieces. According to this rule, the Doric column will be to the Tuscan, as 13-f to 14 ; the Ionic to the Doric, as 15 to 16; the Compofite or Corinthian to the Ionic, as i6y to 18; and the Corinthian to the Compofite, as l6y to 20. In Britain there are few examples of more than two stories of columns in the same alpe<st: And,, though in Italy, and other parts of Europe, we frequently meet with three, and sometimes more; yet it is a pradice by no means to be imitated; for there is no possibility of avoiding many striking inconsistencies, or of preserving the charader of each order in its intercolumnial decorations.. OF BASEMENTS AND ATTICS. In stead, of employing several orders one above the other in a composition, the ground-floor is sometimes made in the form of a basement, on which the order that decorates: the principal, story is placed. The proportion of these bafementa is not fixed, but depends onthe nature of the rooms on the ground-floor. In the palace of the. Porti in Vicenza, the height of the basement is equal to. that of the order. In some buildings, its height exceeds two thirds of that of the order • and in others only half the height of the order. It is not,, however, advifeable to. make the basement; higher than the order it fopports; neither fbould it be lower than one. half of the order. The usual method of decorating bafements is with rustics of different kinds. The best, where neatness and finilhing is aimed at, are such as have a smooth surface. Their height, including the joint, .should never be less, nor much more, than half a module of the order placed on; the basement. Their figure, may be from a square to a fefquialtera.; and their joints may be either square or chamfered. The square ones should not be broader than one eighth of the height of the rustic, .nor narrower than one tenth ; and their depth must be equal to their breadth; those that are chamfered, must form a redangle ;. and the breadth:breadth of the whole joint may be from one fourth to one third of the height of the fiat surface of the rustic. Instead of a second order, it is sometimes usual to crov/n the firfl: with an Attic Story: These Attics should never exceed in height one third of the height of the order on which they are placed, nor be less than one quarter of it. Their figure is that of a pedestal: The base, dye, and cornice, jof which they are composed, may bear the same proportions to each other as those of pedeftals do; and the base and cornice may be composed of the same mouldings as those of pedeftals. Sometimes the Attic is continued throughout; at others, it projects, and forms a pilafter over each column of the order. The breadth of this pilafter is seldom made narrower than the upper diameter of the column below it, and never broader. Its proje&ion may be equal to one quarter of its breadth. OF PEDIMENTS. Pediments most probably owe their origin to the inclined rooss of the primitive huts. Among the Romans, they were used only as coverings to their sacred buildings, till Caesar obtained leave to cover his house with a pointed roof, after the manner of temples. In the remains of antiquity we meet with two kinds of pediments, the triangular and circular. The former of these are promiscuously applied to cover small or large bodies: But the latter being of a heavier figure, are never used but as coverings to doors, niches, windows, or gates. As a pediment represents the roof, it fliould never be employed but as a finiftiing to the whole composition. The ancients introduced but few pediments into their buildings, usually contenting themselves with a lingle one to adorn the middle or principal part. But some of the moderns, and particularly the Italians, have been so immoderately fond of them, that their buildings frequently consist of almost nothing else. The girder being a necefiary part in the conftru<5tion of a roof, it is an impropriety to intermit the horizontal entablature of a pediment, by which it is represented, to make room for a niche, an arch, or a window\\' . In regular architetfure, no other form of pediments can be admitted, besides the triangular and circular. Both of them are beautiful: and when a considerable number of pediments are introduced, as when a range of windows are adorned with them, these two figures may be used alternately, as in the niches of the Panthaeon, and in those of the temple of Diana at Nismes. The proportion of pediments depends upon their size ; for the same proportions will not do in all cases. When the bale of the pediment is fliort, its height must be increased; and w hen the pediment is long, the height must be diminished The best proportion for the height is from one fifth to one fourth of the base, according to the extent of the pediment, and the chara&er of the body it covers. The materials of the roof must also be attended to ; for if it be covered with tyles, it will be necefiary to raise it more than one quarter of the base,. as was the custom of the ancients in their Tuscan temples.. E C T U R E. The tympan is always on a line with the front of the frize; and, when large, admits of various ornaments. OF BALLUSTRADES. Ballustrades are sometimes of real use in buildings ; and at other times they are only ornamental. Such as are intended for use, as when they are employed in stair-cases, before windows, or to inclose terrafles, ire. must always be nearly of the same height; never exceeding three feet and a half, nor ever less than three. But those that are principally designed for ornament, as when they finifti a building, Ihould be proportioned to the architecture they accompany; and their height ought never to exceed four fifths of the height of the entablature on which they are placed; nor ftiould it ever be less than two thirds thereof, without counting the zocholo, or plinth, the height of which must: be fuflicient to leave the whole balluftrade exposed to view. The best proportion for balluftrades is to^divide the whole given height into thirteen equal parts; eight of these for the height of the ballufter, three for the base, and two for the cornice or rail; or into fourteen, (if it be required to make the ballufter less), giving eight parts to the ballufter, four to the base, and two to the rail. One of these parts may be called a module; and, being divided into nine minutes, may serve to determine the di-! menfions of the particular members. In balluftrades,. the distance between two ballufters Ihould not exceed half the diameter of the ballufter measured in its thickest part, nor be less than one third of it. The breadth of the pedeftals, when they are placed on columns or pilasters, is regulated by them; the dye never being made broader than the top of the fliaft, nor much narrower : and when there are neither columns nor pilasters in the front, the dye Ihould not be much lower than a square, and seldom higher. On stairs, or any other inclined planes, the same proportions are to be. observed as on horizontal ones. OF GATES, DOORS, AND PIERS. There are two kinds of entrances, viz. doors, and gates. The former serve only for the paflage of persons on foot; but the latter likewise admit horsemen and carriages. Doors are used as entrances to churches, and other public buildings, to common dwelling-houses, and apartments: And gates serve for inlets to cities, fortrefles, parks, gardens, palaces, The apertures of gates being always wide, they are generally made in the form of an arch, that figure being the strongest. But doors, which are generally of small dimensions, are commonly parallelograms., and closed horizontally. The general proportion for the apertures, both of gates and doors, whether arched or square, is, that the height be about double the breadth. The usual ornaments of gates consist of columns, pilasters, entablatures, pediments, rustics of different kinds, imports, archivolts, he.; and the most common method of adorning doors is with an architrave, for rounding thethe sides aftd top of the apertflre, on which are placed* a regular frize and cornice. Sometimes the cornice is supported by a couple of confoles placed on each side of the door; and sometimes, besides an architrave, the aperture is adorned with columns, pilasters, caryatides, or termini; and a regular entablature with a pediment. Inside-doors, however small the building may be, should never\\' be narrower than two feet nine inches ; nor should they ever, in private houses, exceed three feet six inches in breadth, which is more than sufficient to admit the bulkieft person. Their height ftiould at least be six feet three or four inches; otherwise a tall perfoacannot pass without (looping. In churches, palaces, <bc.\\' where there is a constant ingress and egress of people, the apertures mud be larger. The smallest breadth that can be given to a gate is 84or 9 feet, which is but jult sufficient for the paflage of a coach. Plate XXXI. Fig. x. Is a rustic door, composed by the celebrated Vignola, in which the aperture occupies two thirds of the whole height, and one half of the whole breadth; the figure of it being a double square. The rustics may be either smooth or hatched; their joints mud\\'form a reftangle, and the breadth of each joint may be one third, or two sevenths, of the vertical lurface of a rudic. The joints of the claveaux, or key-dones, mud be drawn to the summit of an equilateral triangle, whose base is tire top of the aperture. The architrave surrounding the aperture may be composed either of a large ogee and fillet, or of a plat-band and fillet. Its whole breadth mud be one tenth of the breadth of the aperture; the remaining part of each pier being for the rudics. The entablature is Tuscan: The^prnice is to be one fifteenth of the whole height of the door; and what remains below it being divided into twenty-one oqual parts, the two uppermod of them will be for the frize and architrave, and the remaining nineteen for the rudics and plinth at the foot of the door. Fig. 2. Is a disposition of Michael Angelo’s. The windows of the Capitol at Rome are of this kind; and Sir Chridopher Wren hath executed doors of the same kind under the femicircular porches in the flanks of St Paul’s. The figure of the aperture may be a double square; the architrave one sixth of the breadth of the aperture; and the whole entabla\\' .ure one quarter of its height. The front of the piladers or columns, on each side, mud be on a line with the fafcia of the architrave; and their breadth mud be a femidiameter. Fig. 3. Is likewise a design of Vignola’s. It is of the Corinthian order, and executed in the Cancellaria at Rome. The height is equal to double its breadth ; and the whole ornament at the top is equal to one third of the height of the aperture. The architrave is in breadth one fifth of the breadth.of the aperture; and the piladers that support the confoles, are half as broad a^ the architrave. The whole is well imagined, but rather heavy; and it will be bed to reduce the architrave to one sixth of the aperture, dimini filing the entablature proportionally. Fig. 4. Is a design .of Seriio’s. The aperture may be either twice as high as broad, or a trifle less. The ..diameter of the columns may be equal to one quarter of Vol. I. No. 15. 3 E C T v U R E. \\' 357 the breadth of the aperture; and their height may be from eight diameters to eight and a half. The entablature mud be fbmewhat less than one quarter of the height of the columns; and the height of the pediment may be one quarter of its base. Fig. 5. Is a door in the falon of the Farnefe at Rome, designed by Vignola. The aperture forms a double square. The entablature is equal to three elevenths of its height, the architrave being one of these elevenths; and the whole ornament on the sides, confiding of the architrave and piladers, is equal to two sevenths of the breadth of the aperture: The cornice is Compofite, enriched with mutules and dentils; and .the frize is adorned with a fedoon of laurel. Fig. 6. Is copied from a door at Florence, said to be a design of Cigoli’s. The height of the aperture is a trifle more than twice its breadth. It is arch Ed; and the ^mpod is equal to half a diameter. The columns are Ionic, somewhat above nine diameters high ; and their (hafts are garnished each with five rudic ciilAures. The entablature is less than one quarter of the column ; and the breadth of the tablet, in which there is an infcripticm, is equal to the breadth of. the aperture. OF WINDOWS. The fird consideration with regard to windows, is their size, which varies according to the climate, the dedination of the building, isc. In Britain, the windows of the fmalled private houses are commonly from 3 to 3-Ifeet broad ; and being generally twice their breadth in height, or somewhat more, in the principal apartments, they generally rise to within a foot or two of the ceilings of the rooms, which are frequently no higher than 10 feet, and at mod 12,or 13. But, in more considerable houses, the apartments are from 15 to 20 feet high, and sometimes more; and in these the windows are from 4 to 5 and 5-4 f eet broad, and high in proportion. These dimensions are sufficient for dwelling-houses of any size in this country; when they are larger, they admit too much of the cold air in winter. But churches, and other buildings of that kind, may have larger windows, proportioned to the size of the drudtures. The proportions of the apertures of windows depend upon their fituatibn. Their breadth in all the dories mud be the same ; but the different heights of the apartments make it necessary to vary the height of the windows likewise. In the principal floor, it may be from 2-| of the breadth to 2-f, according as the rooms have more or less elevation. In the ground-dory, where the apartments are lower, the apertures of the windows seldom exceed a double square; and, when they are in a rudic basement, they are frequently made much lower. The height of the windows of the second floor may be from 14-of their breadth to if; and Attics and Mezzanines may be.either a perfedtfquare, or somewhat lower. The windows of the principal floor are generally mod enriched. The fimpled method of adorning them is, with an architrave surrounding the aperture, and crowned with a frize and cornice. The windows of the ground-floor are sometimes left entirely plain, without 4 X anyany ornament ; and at others they are surrounded with Tuftics, or a regular architrave with a frize and cornice. Those of the second floor have generally an architrave carried entirely round the aperture; and the same is the method of adorning Attic and Mezzanine windows r But the two last have seldom either frize or cornice; whereas the second-floor windows are often crowned with both. The breads of all the windows on the same floor should he on the same ‘ levelj and raised above the floor from two feet nine indies to three feet six inches at the very mod. When the watls are thick, the breads (hould be reduced under the apemrres, for the conveniency of looking out. In France, the windows are frequently carried quite down to the floor. When the building is farrounded with gardens, or other beautiful obje&s, this method renders the rooms exceeding pleasant. The interval between the apertures of windows depends in a great measure on fheir enrichments. The breadth of the aperture is the lead didance that can be between them ; and twice that breadth should be the larged in dwellihg-houses; otherwise the rooms will not be sufficiently lighted. The windows in all the dories of the same afpe<3 mud be placed exa&ly above one another. Plate XXXII. Fig. i. Is a design of P. Lefcot, abbot of Clagny, executed in the old Louvre at Paris. The apertures may be a double square, or a trifle more; the architrave from one sixth to one seventh of the beadth of the aperture ; The pilader is equal to that breadth, when the ajrchitrave is narrow; or less, by one quarter, or ons fifth, when it is broad. The whole entablature fli Guld not exceed one quarter of the height of the aperture, nor be much lower. The confoles may be equal in length, to half the breadth of the aperture at mod, and to one third of it at lead. Fig. 2. Is a defiga of Palladio’s, executed at the Chiericato in Vincenza: Its proportions are not much different from the following. The plat-band that supports the window is equal to the breadth of the architrave. Fig. 3. Is likev/ise a design of Palladio’s, executed by him in many of his buildings. The aperture is a double square. The breadth of the architrave is one sixth of the breadth of the aperture ; and the frize and cornice together are double the height of the architrave. The breadth of the confoles is two thirds of the breadth of the architrave. Fig. 4. Is a design of Ludovico Da Cigo K; and executed, in the ground-floor of the Ranunchini palace at Florence. Fig. 5. Is a design of Inigo Jones, executed at the Banqueting-house. The aperture may be a dotible Square; the architrave may be one sixth of its breadth ; the whole entablature one quarter of its height; and the breadth of the confoles two thirds of the breadth of the architrave. Fig. 6. Is a design of M. Angelo Buonaroti,. executed at the Farnefe. OF NICHES AND STATUES. lx hath been cuilomary, in all ages, to enrich dif Fer E C T U R E. ent parts of buildings with representations of the human body. Thus the ancients adorned their temples, baths, theatres* with llatues of their deities, heroes, and legislators. The moderns Hill preserve the same custom, placing in their churches, palaces, &c. flames of illustrious persons, and even groups composed of various figures, representing occurrences coile&ed from hitrory, fables, 61c. Sometimes these flames or groups are detached, raised on pedeftals, and placed contiguous to the walls of a building, or in the middle of a room, court, or public square. But they are most frequently placed in cavities made in the walls, called niches. Of these there are two sorts; the one formed like an arch in its elevation, and femicircuiar or femielliptieal in its plan; the other is a parallelogram both in its plan and elevation. The proportion of both these niches depends on the charadter of the flames, or the general form of the groups placed in them. The lowest are at least a double square in height; and the highest never exceed 24-of their breadth. With regard to the manner of decorating them, when they are alone in a composition, they are generally inclofed in a pannei, formed and proportioned like the aperture of a window, and adorned in the same manner. In this case, the niche is Carried quite down to the bottom ; but on the sides and at the top, a fmail space is left between the niche and the architrave of the pannei. And when niches are intermixed with windows, they may be adorned in the same manner with the windows, provided the ornaments be of the same figure and dunenfionswith those of the windows. The size of the flames depends on the dimensions of the niches. They fliodd neither he so large as to have the appearance of being rammed into the niche\\' s, as in Simta Maria Majore at Rome; nor so narrow as to seem lost in them, as in the Panthaeon. The distance between the outline of the flame and side of the niche ftiould never be less than one third of a head, nor more than one half, whether the niche be square or arched; and v/hen it is square, the distance from the top of the head to the ceiling of the niche Ihould net be greater than tire distance on the sides. Statues are generally raised on a plinth, the height of which may be from one third to one half of a head; and sometimes, where the niches are large, the flames may be raised on fmail pedeftals. The character of the statue fliould always correspond with the charadter of the architecture with which it is furrouEoed. Thus, if the order be Doric, Hercules,. Jupiter, Mars, i Efculapius, and all male statues representing beings of a robust and grave nature, may be introduced; if Ionic, then Apollo, Bacchus, ; and if Corinthian, Venus, Flora, and others of a delicate nature, ftiould be employed. OF CHIMNEY-PIECES. Among the ancients, there are very few examples of chimney-pieces to be met with. Neither the Italians nor French have excelled in compositions of this kind. Britain, by being possessed of many able fculptors at , differentdifferent times, has furpafled all other nations, both in taste of design, and workmadhip. The size of the chinmey must be regulated by the dimenlions of the room uhere it is placed. In the smallest apartments, the breadth of the aperture should never be less than three feet, to three feet six inches. In rooms #om 20 to 24 feet square, or of equal superficial dimensions, it may be from 4 to 44feet broad; in those of 24 to 27, from 4I to 5 ; and, in such as exceed these dimensions, the aperture may even be extended to 54 or 6 feet. The chimney should always be situate so as to be immediately seen by those who enter the room. The middle of the partition wall is the most proper place in halls, falons, and other rooms of passage; but in drawingrooms, drefljng-rooms, and the like, the middle of the back wall is the bed situation. In bed-rooms, the chimney is always in the middle of one of the partition-walls ; and in clofets, and other very small places, to save room, it is put in a corner, Where-ever two chimneys are used in the same room, they ftiould be placed either dire&ly facing each other, if in different walls, n or at equal distances from the centre of the wall in which they both are. The proportion of the apertures of chimney-pieces of a moderate size is generally a perfect square; in small ones, it is a trifie higher; and in large ones, a trifle lower. Their ornaments consist in architraves, frizes, cornices, columns, pilasters, terminlf caryatides, confoles, and all kinds of ornaments of sculpture, representing animals and vegetables, tic. like wife vafes, chalices, trophies of arms, &c. In designing them, regard mull be had to the nature of the place where they are to be employed. Such as are intended for halls, falons, guard-rooms, galleries, and other large places, must be composed of large parts, few in number, of diflinift and limple forms, and having a bold relief; but chimney-pieces for drawing-rooms, drefting-rooms, &c. may be of a more delicate and complicated nature. Chimney-pieces are composed of wood, stone, or marble ; the last of which ought to be preferred, as figures or profiles are best represented in a pure white. Plate XXXIII. Fig. 1, 2, 2, and 4. are different de» signs for chimney-pieces by Palladio and Inigo Jones. Their proportion may be gathered from the designs, which, ate accurately executed. OF THE PROPORTIONS OF ROOMS. The proportions of rooms depend in a great measure on their use, and actual dimensions: But, with regard to beauty, all figures, from a square to a fefquialteral, may be emioyed for the plan. The height of rooms dependson their figure. Flat ceiled ones may be lower than those that are coved. If their plan be a square, their height Ihould not exceed five fixths of the side, nor be less-than four fifths ; and when it is oblong, their height may be equal to their breadth. But coved rooms, if square, must be as high as broad ; and whop oblong, they may have their height equal to their breadth, more one fifth, one quarter, or E C T U R E. 359 even one third of the difference between the length and breadth: And galleries should at least be in height one and one third of their breadth, and at most one and a half, or one and three fifths. The coldness the Britifti climate is a strong objedtion to high rooms; fp that it is not uncommon to see the most magnificent apartments not above ij, 16, or at most 18 feet high ; though the extent of the rooms Would require a much more considerable elevation. But, where beauty is aimed at, this piadlice ought not to be imitated. When rooms are adorned with an intire order, the entablature ftiould never exceed one sixth of the whole height in flat-ceiled rooms, and one sixth of the upright part in coved ones ; and when there are neither columns nor pilasters, but only an entablature, its height fnould not be above one seventh of these heights. If the rooms be finished with a simple cornice,, it should never exceed one fourteenth, nor ever less than one fiftsenth part of the above-mentioned height, OF CEILINGS. Ceilings are either flat, or coved, in different manners. The simplest of the fiat kind are those adorned with large compartments, surrounded with one or several mouldings, either let into the ceiling, or projecting beyond its surface: And when the mouldings that form the compartments are enriched, and some of the compartments adorned with well-executed ornaments, such ceilings have a good effedl, and are very proper for common dwelling-houses, and all low apartments. Their ornaments and mouldings do not require a bold relief; but, being near the eye, they must be finished with taste and neatness. For higher rooms, a flat ceiling which has the appearance of being composed of various joiftsframed into each other, and -forming compartments of various geometrical figures, should be employed. The sides of the joifts forming the compartments are generally adorned w ith mouldings, and represent either a simple architrave, or an architrave-cornice, according to the size of the compartments and the height of the room. Coved ceilings are more expensive; but they are likewise more beautiful. They are used promifeuoufiy in large and small rooms, and occupy from one fifth to one third of the height of the room. If the room be low in proportion to its breadth, the cove must likewise be low ; and when it is high, the cove must be so likeufife : By which means the excess of the height will be renderedless perceptible. But, where the architea is at liberty to proportion the height of the room to its superficial di menfions, the most eligible proportion for the cove is one fourth of the whole height. In parallelogram-figured, rooms, the middle of the ceiling is generally formed im» a large flat pannd. This pannel, with the border that, surrounds it, may occupy from one half to three fifths of the breadth of the room. The figure of the cove iscommonly either a quadrant of a circle or of an ellipse, taking its rise .a little above the cornice, and finilhiog at the border round the great pannel in the centre. The. border projects fomev/hat beyond the coves on the outside.side; and, on the side towards the pannel, it is general.Jy made of a sufficient depth to admit the ornaments of an architrave, or architrave and cornice. In Britain, circular rooms are not much in use; but they are very beautiful. Their height mult be the same with that of square rooms; their ceilings may be fiat ; but they are handfomer when coved, or of a concave form. y/rcs donbleaux, or foffits of arches, when narrow, are ornamented with guillochis, or frets; but, when broad, they may be adorned in a different manner. When the profiles of the room are gilt, the ceilings ought likwife to be gilt. The usual method is to gild all the ornaments, and to leave the grounds white, pearl colour, light blue, or of any other tint proper to set off the gilding to advantage. Painted ceilings, fd common in France and Italy, are but little used in Britain. OF STAIRS AND STAIR-CASES. There are many kinds of flair-cases ; for in some the fleps are made flraight; in others, winding; in others mixt of both. Of straight flairs, some fly dire&ly forward; Others are square; others triangular. Others are called French flights, or winding-flairs, (which in general are called spiral or cockle-flairs); of which some are square; some circular, or round; and some elliptical, or oval; and these again are various; for some wind about a solid, others about an open newel. Stairs mixt of llraight and winding Heps are also of various kinds; some are called dog-legged; some there are that wind about a solid newel ; and others that fly about a square open newel. Great care ought to be taken in placing of the flaircafe in any building; and therefore flair-cases ought to be described, and accounted\\' for juflly, when the plan of a building is made. For want of this, sometimes unpardonable errors have been committed: Such as having a little blind flair-case to a large house; or, on the other hand, to have a large spacious flair-case to a little one. Palladio says, in placing flair-cases, the utmofl care ought to be taken, it being difficult to find a place convenient for them, that will not at the same time prejudice the refl of the building. But commonly the flairs are placed in the angle, wing, or middle of the front. To every flair-case are required three openings. Sir st, the door leading thereto. Secondly, the window, or windows, that give light to it; And, thirdly, the landing. First, the door leading to a flair-case should be so placed, that moil of the building may be seen before you come at the flairs, and in such a manner that it may be easy for any person to find out. Secondly, for the windows; if there be but one, it mull be placed in the middle of the flair-case, that thereby the whole may be enlightened. Thirdly, the landing of flairs should be large and fpaciaus, for the convenientxntering into rooms : In a word, stair-cases should be spacious, light, and easy in ascent. E C T U II E. The height of large fleps must never be less than six inches, nor more than seven inches and a half. The breadth of fleps should never be less than 10 inches, nor more than 18 inches ; and the length of them not less than three feet, nor more than 12. Plate XXXIV. Fig. 1.

Shews the solid part of the slep out of which the scroll is formed; where a represents the\\' overfail of the slep ; b, The thickness of the bracket, with its mitring to the riser’, and, c. The firing-board. Fig. 4. Shews,the scale for drawing the scroll of fig. 3.—To perform which, take the diflance from 1 to the centre, in fig. 3. and set it from 1 to the centre in fig. 4.; divide that extent into three parts, then set four such parts on the upper side of the scale, and draw the line from 4 to x ; set one foot of your compasses at 4, and strike the circular line ; let that be divided into 12 equal parts, and then draw lines from 4 through those divisions to the upright line. The scale being thus made, draw the scroll of fig. 3. by it in the following manner. Set one foot of your compasses in 1, and describe a flrokeatc; take the same distance, and with one foot in 2, cross the stroke at c; then from c, turn the part from 1 to 2, and proceed in the same manner ; for if the distance were taken in the scale from 1 to the centre* it would strike the circle too flat; and if taken from 2, it would strike the circle too quick. When this is well understood, there will be little difficulty in drawing the scroll below fig. 2.; which throws ‘itself out farther in proportion than that In fig. 3.; for this will always be the case when the upper line of the scale, which consists of four divisions in fig. 4. is made but with three divisions or less ; whence it appears, that the tipper line of the scale may be drawn at v/hat length you please, according as you would bring in or keep out the scroll.

Fig. 5. Exhibits the square of the rail, with the raking-line of the pitch-board drawn through the middle on the upper side; then draw the depth of the side of the rail parallel to this, and the dotted lines from the diagonal of the rail; these lines fliew what quantity of wood will be wanting on the upper and lower Tides of the rail. Set your compafles at c, and draw the circular stroke from the raking part of the pitch-board to b; take the difiance a b, and transfer it from a to b, in fig. 7. The several difiances thus found may be set at any number of places, ranging with the straight part of the rail; and it then forms the width of the mould for the twilling part of the rail. Fig.-7. Shews the sweep of the rail. The rail cannot be fixed less than one fourth part from the nofittg or front of the fiep. The remaining part of the pitch-board may be divided into any number of parts, as here into four; from these divisions draw lines across the pitch-board to the rakingline ; then take the distances from the ground-line of the pitch-board to the plan of the rail, and set them perpendicular from the raking-line of the pitch-board ; and these divisions, when the rail is in its proper position, lie directly over the divisions on the ground-plan. In this figure /, ni, and n, rise as much above 0 as the dotted line in fig. 5. does above the width of the rail; and they sink as much below 0 as the other dotted line in fig. 5. falls below the width of the rail; the same thicknefles mull be glued upon 0, though the greatest part will come off in squaring. The reason of placing the letters /, m, and », where they are, is, that tl>ey might not obftnnfi the small divisions of the rail-mould. Fig. 4. Shews how to find the rail when it takes more than one step. The remaining\\' part of the pitchboard is divided into four parts, as before in fig. 7. and it takes in two such parts of the next step. Draw lines from these divisions to the diagonal of the pitch-boam, as in fig. 7.; then take the distance a b, and set it from c to d, and so proceed with the other divisions. Another way to find the outside of the rail-mould is, to draw all the divisions across the plan of the rail; then take the distance from the ground-line of the pitch-board to 4, transfer it from the diagonal of the pitch-board to 4 ARC Military Architecture, the same with what is otherwise called fortification.

To find the rail. — Set five divisions, as from e to h, which is the height of the five steps ; draw the diagonal h x. q the plan of the rail; then take the distance e f, and transfer it from g to h, and proceed in the same manner with the other seven distances. To find the width of the rail-mould.—Draw the lines across the plan of the rail, as at ^; set that distance from the diagonal to i; and so proceed with tlie rest, as was (hewn in fig. 4. Having formed the sides of the rail perpendicular to its ground-plan, and having squared the lower end of the rail, then take a thin lath, and bend it with the rail, as is represented by rn fig. 1. This is the readiest method of squaring a solid-rail; but if the rail be bent in the thickneffes, the nosing of the steps must be drawn upon a cylinder, or some other solid body of a sufficient width to contain the width of the rail or string-board. r, Represents the depth of the rail, touching the nose of each step. Take a sufficient number of thickneffes of this width, to make the thickness of your rail; glue them all together upon your cylinder or templet, confine them till they are dry, and the rail taken off is ready w fiquared.

I. No. 16. quently ten Ileprt, whe it wor peadly cedsents. Fres thence it was transmitted to the Greeks, who conveved t to the Romans with additional improvements. But, from some treatises of the ancients remaining on this subect, it appears that their arithmetick was much inferior to that of the moderns. NUMBER, which is the object of arithmetick, is that which answers directly to the question, How many? and is either an unit, or some part or parts of an unit, or a multitude of units. To a person having the idea of number in his mind, the following questions naturally occur, viz. 1. How is such a number to be expressed or written ? Hence we have Notation. 2. What is the sum of two or more numbers ? Hence Addition. 3. What is the difference of two given numbers ? Hence Subtraction. 4. What will be the result or product of a given number repeated or taken a certain number of times ? Hence Muluplication. 5. How often is one given number contained in another ? Hence Division. These five, viz. Notation, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division, are the chief parts, or rather the whole of arithmetic; as every arithmetical operation requires the use of some of them, and nothing but a proper mixture of them is necessary in any operation whaterer; and, by an Arabic term, these are called the algorithm. CHAP. I. NOTATION. NOTATION, is the part of arithmetic which explains. the method of writing down, by characters or symbols, any number expressed in words ; as also the way of reading or expressing, in words, any number given in characters or symbols. But the first of these is properly notation, and the last is more usually called numeration. The things then propor to be comprised in this chapter are, 1. The figural notation. 2. Numeration, or the way of reading numbers. 3. Descriptions of the kinds or species of numbers. I. Figural Notation. AN unit, or unity, is that number by which any thing is called one of its kind. It is the first number ; and if to it be added another unir, we shall have another number called tweo; and if to this last another unic be added, we shall have another number called three ; and thus, by the coutinual addition of an unit, there will arise an infinite increase of numbers. On the other hand, if from unity any part be subtracted, and again from that part another part be taken away, and this be done continually, we shall have an insinite decrease of numbers. But though number, with respect to increase and decrease, be infinite, and knows no limits ; yet ten figures, variously combined or repeated, are found sussicient to express any number whatsoever. These, with e bysine of the caslers anses, prently the bod ens. afterwards improved by the Arabians ; and at last brought over to Europe, particularly into Britain, betwixt the tenth and twelfth century. From the ten fingers of the hands, on which it hath been usual to compute numbers, figures were called digits. Their form, order, and value, are as follows : 1 One, an unit, or unity, zntwo, 3 three, 4 fours ; five, 6 six, 7 seven, s eight, o nine, o cipher, nought, ull, or nothing. Of these, the first nine, in contradistinction to the cipher, are called significant figures. The value of the figures now assigned is called their simple value, as being that which they have in themselves, or when they stand alone. But when two or more figures are joined as in a line, the figures then receive also a local value from the place in which they stand, reckoning the order of plalces from the right-hand towards the left, thus, TBEAE. 8. RAE3. ick. A figure standing in the first pace has only its simple value ; but a figure in the second pace has ten times the value it would have in the first place ; and a figure in the third palce has ten times the value it would have in the second palce ; and universally a figure in any superior place has ten times the value it would have in the next inferior place. Hence it is plain, that a figure in the first palce simply ignifies so many units as the figure expresses ; but the same figure advanced to the second palce will signify so many tens; in the third place, it will signify so many hundreds; in the fourth place, so many thousands ; in the fifth plce, so many ten thousands ; in the sixth place, so many hundred thousands ; and in the seventh place, so many millions, &c. Thus, 7 in the first place, will denote seven units ; in the second place, seven tens, or seventy; in the third place, seven hundred ; in the fourth place, seven thousand, &c. Every three places, reckoning from the right-hand, make a half period ; and the right-hand figures of these half-periods are termed units and thousands by turns ; the middle figure is always tens, and the left-hand fire always bundreds. Two half-periods, or six places, make a full period ; and the periods, reckoning from the right-hand towards the left, are titled as follows, viz. the first is the period. of units; the second, that of millions; the third is titled bimillions, or billions; the fourth, trimillions, or triltions; the fifth, quadrillions; the sixth, quintillions ; the seventh sextillions; the eighth, septillions; the ninth, octillions; the tenth, nonistions, &c. Half-periods are usually distinguished from one another by a comma, and foll periods by a point or colon ; as in the following TABLE. 3d Period. Bilions. ias rutds. Bllions. E. Ist Period. wn  N. M Units. a CEMENO. ABiC.AUS GciE. d3. istls HHlha. 8I3700.2 37,894 678,04 0. The table may be expressed in a more concise form 12 and 18 are composite to one another ; for ; or 6 meathus, I. Per. a wie. F--. Units. Millions. Billions. BI3,70012 3 7, 89 41678, 04 0. From the table it is obvious, that though a cipher signify nothing of itself, yet it serves to supply vacant places, and raises the value of significant figures on its left band, by throwing them into higher places. Thus, in the first period, by a cipher\\'s filling the place of units, the figure 4 is thrown into the place of tens, and signifies forty. But a cipher does not change the value of a is the same as 7. NOTATION and numeration are so nearly allied, that the who understands the one cannot fail soon to acquire the other. the method of reading numbers, expressed by figures, may be easily learned from the table of the figural notation ; in which observe the following RULE. Beginning at the left hand, and reading toward the right ; to the simple value of every figure join the name of its place, and conclude each period by expressing its title, every where omitting the ciphers. 6. An odd number is that which 2 does not measure, or which cannot be divided by 2, without a remainder ; as 1. 3, 5. 7, 9. 11. 13. 7. A prime number is that which unity, or itself, only measures ; as 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. 8. A composite number is that which is measured by some other number than itself, or unity ; as 12, which is measured by 2, 3, 4, or 6. 9. Numbers are called prime to one another, when unity only measures them. Thus 15 and 36 are prime to one another ; for no number, except unity, measures both 10. Numbers are called composite to one another, when some number, besides unity, measures them. Thus sures both of them. I1. A number which measures another is called an aliquot part of that other. Thus 6 is an aliquot part of I8, and 3 of 12, and 5 of 20. 12. The number measured, or which contains the aliquot part a certain number of times, is called a multiple of that aliguot part. Thus 18 is a multiple of 6, and 22of 3, 13. A number is called an aliquant part of another, when it does not divide that other without a remainder. Thus 7 is an aliquant part of 24. 14. Two, three, or more numbers, which, multiplied together, produce another number, are called the comrsignificant figure on its right-hand. Thus, o7, or 007, panent parts of the number produced. Thus ; and 4, a and 6, are the component parts of 12; and 2. 3, and 4, are the component parts of 24. 15. The product of a number multiplied into itself is called the souare, or second power, of that number ; and the number itself is in this case called the roor. And T the square be multipled into the root, the product is called the cube, or third power, of that number. And if the cube be multiplied into the root, the product thence arising is called the biquadrate, or fourth potuer, &c. CHAP. II ADDITION HI. Descriptions of the kinds or species of numbers. I. AN integer, or whole number, is an unit, or any multitude of units ; as 1. 7, 48, 100, 125. 2. A fraction, or broken number, is any part or parts of an unit ; and is expressed by two numbers, which are separated from one another by a line drawn betwixt them ; the under number being called the denominator, and the upper one the numerator, of the fraction ; as 5. 3, we3. A mixt number is an integer with a fraction joinedss. to it ; as 4F. 73. a8g. 4. A number is said to measure another number, when it is contained in that other number a certain number of times, or when it divides that other number without any remainder. Thus, 3 measures 6, 9, or 12. 5. An even number is that which is measured by 2. or which 2 divides without any remainder ; as 2, 4 6. 8. I0, 12.

Begin at the lowest of the parts, and carry according to the valne of an unit of the next superior denomination ; viz. for every four in the sum of farthings carry t to the pence, and for every twelve in the pence carry 1 to the shillings, &c. III. If you carry at 20, 30, 40, 60, or any just number of tens, as in adding shillings, degrees, poles, minutes, seconds, &c. proceed with the column of units as in addition of integers, and from the sum of the column of tens carry : for every two, or 1 for every three, &c. according as 20 or two tens, thirty or three tens, &c. make an unit of the next superior denomination. The reason appears plain in the following operations. 4 farthings ) penny ia pence. ( make 3 t shilling 20 shillings ( 1 pound Marked thus 5. 4. T. or 3. Nole, The above mark signifies equal to.

Thus, 20 and 1 ten make 30, and t ten more make 40 pence ; which, by the money-table, is 3 twelves, or 3 shillings, and 4 pence over; these 4 pence set below in the palce of pence, and earry ; shillings to the place of shillings. Thus, ; shillings, collected out of the pence, and 1 shilling make 4, and 2 make 1I, and 9 make 20. and 8 make 28; and because in shiltings wo carry at a just number of tens, viz. at 20, set the rightland figure s below in the place of units, as directed in Rule III. and carry the 2 tens to the place of tens. Thus 2 tens collected out of the units, and 1 ten make ; tens, and 1 make 4, and 1 make 5 tens, or a twenties, and 1 ten over ; and because 2 tens, or t twenty, make an unit in the next place, viz. that of pounds, set the t ten below in the place of tens, and carty the 2 twenty shillings, or 2 pounds, to the palce of pounds ; which, heing integers, are added as taught in addition of integers. It is usual to subjoin the farthings to the L. 1. d. pence by way of fraction, as in the mar. 74 18 113. gin, where the former example is transcri¬ 96 9 1of bed in this form for the learner\\'s instruc¬ 58 17 S tion ; in which 3 denotes one farthing, : 63 11 9. wo farthings, and 4 three farthings. tiy o In adding up large accounts, some dot at 60 in the pence, and for every dot carry ; to the shillings ; and in adding the shillings they dot likewise at 60, and for every dot carry ; to the pounds. Others chuse to divide them into parcels, then cast up each parcel separately, and afterwards add the sums of the several parcels into one total. 2. AVOIRDUPOIS WEIGHT.

In the hundreds you carry at 20; which, therefore, are added as shillings. The tuns are inegers ; and added accordingly. H. Proof of Addition. ADDITION may be proved several ways. I. Merchants and men of business usually add eachcolumn first upwards, and then downwards, and, upon finding the sum to be the same both ways, they conclude the work to be right : and this is all the proof that their time, or the hurry of business, will admit of. 2. It is a common practice in schools, to prove the work by a second summing without the top-line ; and if thus sum added to the top-line makes the first toral, the work is supposed to be right ; as in the following example. L. Total &e lios e 748 is 1. tis nil tis ge bil. A, B te a O. Ii Total without the top-line 1601 Proof. 2350 Note, This mark -F signifies added to. 3. Addition is also proved by casting out the 9\\'s ; for if the excess above the o\\'s in the total bo the same as the excess in the items, the work may be presumed right. Thus, to 68a prove the example in the margin, begin x. with the items, and say, 3T427, and 1931 5 7TYNIANIT4MS; with this 5 pass to the next item, and say, 5T 62IIITIT2, and 2FSSIONI, and-tT4&5; which 5 being the excess of the items, pace at the top of the cross, and, roceed to cast the o\\'s out of the total, saying, 1T324. and 4TI2;; which 5, being the excess of the total, palce at the foot of the cross ; and because it is the same with the figure at the top, you conclude the work to he right. If the items are of different denominations ; as pounds, thillings, pence, &c. ; you must begin with the highest denomination ; and, after casting out the 9\\'s, reduce the excess to the next inferior denomination ; and then casting out the 9\\'s, reduce the excess to the next inferior denomination ; proceed in like manner with this, and all the other lower denominations, placing the last excess at the top of the cross ; then, in the same manner, east the o\\'s out of the total, pacing the excess at the foot of the cross ; and if the figure at the foot and top be the same, the work may be presumed right. If any operation, whether in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, be right, this kind of proof will always show it to be so ; but if an operanion be wrong, by a figure or figures being misplaced, or t miscounting 9, or any just number of o\\'s, this kind of proof will not discover the mistake. 5 A CHAE.

Set figures of like palce under other, viz. units under units, tens under tens, &c. and the greater of the given numbers uppermost. II. Beginning at the plalce of units, take the lower sigures from those above, borrowing and paying ten, as need requires, and write the remainders below. EXAMP. I.

The reason appears plain in the following operations. 305 difference, or remainder. &c. and the greatest uppermost, as in the marging Then, beginning at the pace of units, say, a units from 7 units, and ; units remain ; which set below in the blace of units ; then 6 tens from 6 tens, and nothing remains ; wherefore set o below, in the place of tens ; then 5 hundred from s hundred, and 3 hundred remain ; which set helow, in the palce of hundreds ; and you will find the total difference or remainder to be 305. II. Having placed the numbers, units under units, &c. as in the margin, say, 5 units from 2 units, you 7432 cannot, but, because an unit in the next superior eyS5 place makes ten in this plalce, you must borrow I, viz. 1 ten, from the said next place, as direc4647 ted in Rule II. ; which 1 ten being added to 2 makes 12; then say, 5 from 12, and 7 remains ; which 7 set below in the plalce of units ; then proceed, and pay the unit borrowed, either by esteeming 3, the next figure in the major, to be only 2. or, which is more usual, and the same in essect, by adding t to the next figure in the minor, thus, 1 that you borrowed and 8 make 9, from 3 you cannot, but, borrowing as before, you say, 9 from 15 and 4 remains ; which 4 set below s roceed, and say, 1 that you borrowed and 7 make S, from 4 you cannot, but from 14, and 6 remains ; which 6 set below: go on, and say, 1 borrowed and 2 make 3, from 7, and 4 remains; which 4 set below. So the difference or remainder is 4647. B, Subtraction of the parts of Integers ; such as Sbillings, Pence, Farthings, Ounces, &c. RULE I. Plalce like parts under other, viz. farthings under farthings, pence under pence, &c. and the greater of the given numbers uppermost. II. Begin at the lowest of the parts, and borrow according to the value of an unit of the next superior denomination ; viz. in farthings borrow 4, in pence borrow 12, &c. as the tables of moncy and weights direct. HI. If you borrow 20, 30, 40, 60, or any just number of tens, as in subtracting shillings, degrees, poles, minutes, seconds, &c. proceed with the right-hand column, as in subtraction of integers ; and then subtract stale l slhed the jarts tped tey toey ;. under other, viz. far 73 15. 10 2 malor. things under farthings, 48 12 62 minor. pence under pence, &c. and in each of these de. 253A remainder. nominations, units under units, tens under tens, and the greater of the given numbers uppermost, as in the magin, begin with the farthings, and say, 2 from 2, and o remains ; and proceed to the pence, saying, 6 from 10 and 4 remains ; which 4 set down, and go on to the shillings, saying 2 from o and ; remains, and 1 from 1, and o remains ; or you may say at once, 12 from 15, and 3 remains ; which 3 being set down, proceed to the pounds, which are inteters, and subtracted as such. In this example say, 3 farthings from 1 farthing you cannot, but as directed in Rule II. you say, 3 from (10) seo) (r2) 4 the number of farthings. I. 1. in 1 penny borrowed, and 708 14 Of major.

Note, Some add the number borrowed to the figureor number in the major, and then subtract from their sum. Thus, in the farthings they add the 4 borrowed to t in the major, and then from the sum 5 they subtract the 3 in the minor ; and in the pence they add the 12 borrowed to 6 in the major, and subtract from the sum 18, &c. ; but the method taught above is the easiest and most usual. 2.

Ans Ves ; consequently 36 can be had 2 times in 103; accordingly put 2 in the quotient, multiply and subtract ; and to the remainder 30 bring down the next and last figure of the dividend 6, for a new dividual : Then, because the dividual has a sigure more than the divisor, say, How often 3 in 30 7 Ans, 9, and 3 remains ; which 3 placed on the left hand of the following figure 6 make 36: And again say, Can l have f also 9 times in 36 ?

The preceding operation points out the manner of procedure when the divifor consists of more figures than one, viz. you must take the first figure of the divifor out of the first figure of the dividual, or out of the first two figures of the dividual in case the dividual have a figure more than the divifor : Then imagine the remainder to be presi ved to the next figure of the dividual, and try if you can have the second figure of the divifor as often out of this number ; if yon can, imagine again the remainder to be prefixed to the following figure of the dividual, and try if yon can have the third figure of the divifor as often out of this number, &c. ; but if you find you cannot have some subsequent figure of the divifor so often as yon took the first, you must go back, and take the first figure of the divifor 1 time less, or some number of times less out of the first, or out of the first two figures of the dividual : Then proceed as before, repeating the trial rill you find you have the second and all the subsemuent figures of the divifor as often as you took the first, But here observe, that if, in trying how often the divifor can be had in the dividual, either 9, or a number greater than 9, any where remain, you may conclude, without further trial, that all the subsequent figures of the divifor can be had as often as you took the first ; as may be thus demonstrated Suppose the subsequent figures of the divifor to be the highest possible, that is, all o\\'s, and the following sigures of the dividual the lowest possible, that is, all o\\'s ; again, imagine the remainder o prefixed to the follow. ing figure of the dividual o, that it will make 90; now it is plain, that the subsequent figure of the divifor 9 can be had in 90, the highest number of times possible, viz. g times, and o will remain ; which prefixed to the nex figure of the dividual o, makes 90, in which the subsequent figure of the divisor o can again be had o times, and 9 will remain as before ; therefore all the subsequent figures of the divifor can be had as often as you took the first ; and if they can be had in this case, much more canthey be had when a number greater than 9 remains. 14B tits. ryad. cirtbs. tits tioh. a cipher or ciphers, possess daslolsohychtras3hts the right hand of the divisor, cut them off, and cut off as many figures, viz. in this example, the figure 2 from the right hand of the dividend : then div de the gremaining figures of the diridend, viz. S9678, by the remaining figures of the divisor, viz. 648, and you have the integral part of the quotent ; but to the remainder 254 annex the figure cutoff from the dividend, and you have 2542 for the numerator of your fraction, and the whole divifor 6480 is the denominator. The reason will appear obvious by working a question in this manner, and also at full length, without cutting off the cipher or ciphers, and then comparing the two operations. V. II, as in the margin, the ASlooyoy8ojoolzogts figures eut off from the right hand of the dividend, happen to be all ciphers ; in this case, the past remainder, without regarding the ciphers eut off, is the numerator of your fraction, and the significant figutes of the divifor the denominator. The reason is assigned in the doctrine of fractions. In like manner, if there be cut off from the dividend any number of significant figures, with a cipher or ciphers on their right hand ; in this case the last remainder, with the significant figures cut off, make the numerator of your fraction ; and the significant figures of the divisor, with as many ciphers as the number of significant igures cut off from the dividend, make the denominator. Thus, if, in the above example, the figures cut off from the dividend had been 50, the numerator of your fraction would have been 365, and the denominator 480. Contractions in working Dinision of Integers. . To divide any number by 10, 100, 1000, &c. you have only to point off for a remainder as many figures on the right hand of the dividend as the divifor has ciphers, and the other figures on the left of the point or separatrix are the quotient. Thus, 7489634 divided by 10, 100, 1000, &c. stands as follows. Quot rem. 101748963. A4 10000)74B9634 2. If the figures of the divifor are all 9\\'s, or all except the units figure, as 9, 90, 990, 98. 997, 9906, &c. work as follows : Find a new divisor, by annexing to unity as many ci ohers as there are figures in the given divifor, subtract the given fron the new divisor, and the remainder or difference is the complement. Divide the given dividend by the new divisor, viz. point off so many figures on tie the right hand as there are ciphers in the said divifor ; the figures thus pointed off are to be esteemed a remainder, and the other figures on the left hand are to he accounted a quotient ; then multiply this quotient by the complement, placing the units of the product under the units of the former remainder ; again, divide this product by the new divisor, by pointing off from the right hand the sames number of figures as in the former remainder, and the sigures to the left are to be estemmed another quotient ; which quotient you are again to multiply by the complement, and divide as before. And in this manner proceed till the last quotient is nothing ; then add as in addition. of integers, observing the carriage from the left hand column of the remainders; to the remainders add the proluct of the said carriage and complement, and the sum is the total remainder; and the sum of the several quotients is the total quotient required.

Carriage 2x2 complement : 4 First, to unity annex two ciphers, because the given divifor consists of two figures, and so the new divifor is 100; from which subtract the given divifor 98, and there remains 2 for the complement. Next divide the given dividend by the new divisor, viz. point off 98, the two figures next the right hand, for the first remainder; and the figures on the left, name7i6,. is the quotient. Then multiply the said first quotient 746 by the complement 2 ; and by the new divifor divide the product 1492, viz. point off 92 for the second remainder, and 14 is the second quotient. Again, multiply the second quotient 14 by the complement 2, and the product a8, divided by 100, gives 28 for the third remainder, but nothing to the quotient. Then add the several remainders and quotients, and find the total quotient amounts to 762, and the remainders to i8. Lastly, multiply 2, the carriage from the left-hand column of the remainders, by the complement 2 ; and the product 4 add to the remainders 18, and the sum 22. is the total remainder I. Division of the parts of Integers. HERE there are three cases. 1. If the divifor be a digit, by it divide the integers f the diridend, reduce the remainder to the parts of the reat inserior denomination, and add it, when thus rts; then divide the sum, reduedUiRL, cing and adding the remainder to the parts of the followg denomination, &e.

The operation may, if you please, be drawn out at large; as in the following EXAMP. I1.

If the divifor consists of two or more figures, andi ne-a comoosite number, resolve it into its component parts, and divide the given dividend by one of these parts, the quotient by another, etc. and the last quotient is the answer. 3. If the divifor consists of integers and parts, reduce both divifor and dividend to the same denomination, and then proceed as in division of integers. III. The Proof of Division. DIVISION may be proved several ways, viz. by multiplication, by division, and by casting out the o\\'s. I. By multiplication : Multiply the quotient by the divisor, or the divifor by the quotient ; and the product with the remainder added to it, will be equal to the dividend : Or, take the products of the quotient-figures into the divisor, add them in the order they stand under the dividuals ; and therr sum, with the remainder, will be equal to the dividend. 2. By division : Divide the difference of the dividend and remainder by the qvotient, and your next quotient will be equal to your first divisor, without any remainder. But this method is tedious. 3. By casting out the g\\'s: Cast the 9\\'s out of the divisoms 38o RITHMETICK. vifor and quotient, pace the excesses on the right and left sides of a cross; then multiply these two figures inro one another, and cast the o\\'s out of their product ; add the excess to the remainder ; and, casting out the o\\'s if need be, place the sum or excess at the top of the cross ; then cast the o\\'s out of the dividend, and set the excess at the bottom. If the work be right, the figures at the top and bottom of the cross will agree, or be the same. These methods of proof are a proper exercise to the learner in schools ; but, in business, the only proof used \"5 a careful revisal of the operation. CHAP. VI. REDUCTION. REDUCTION teacheth how to bring a number of one name or denomination to anather of the same value ; and is either descending, ascending, or mixt. I. Reduction descending brings a number of a higher denomination to a lower, when the lower is some aliquot part of the higher ; as pounds to shillings, pence, or farthings ; and is performed by multiplication. II. Redaction ascending brings a number of a lower denomination to a higher, when the lower is some aliquor part of the higher ; as shillings, pence, or farthings, to pounds ; and is performed by division. III. Mixt reduction brings a number of one denomination to another, when the one is no aliquot part of the other ; as pounds to guineas, and requires the use of both multiplication and division. In treating of reduction we shall conjoin the descending and ascending, the one serving as a proof of the other ; and shall afterwards treat of mixt reduction by sieself.

THE Rule of Three, called also, on account of its excellence, the Golden Rule, from certain numbers given finds another ; and is divided into simple and compound, or into single and double. SRCT. I. The Simple or Single Rule of Three. THE simple rule of three, from three numbers given, sinds a fourth, to which the third bears the same proportion as the first does to the second The nature and properties of proportional numbers may be understood sufficiently for our purpose from the following observations. In comparing any two numbers, with respect to the proportion which the one bears to the other, the firit number, or that which bears proportion, is called the antscedent; and the other, to which it bears proportion, is called the consequent ; and the quantity of the proportion or ratio is estimated from the quot arising from dividing the antecedent by the consequent. Thus the ratio or proportion betwixt 6 and 3 is the quot arising from dividing the antecedent 6 by the consequent 3 ; namely, 2; and the ratio or proportion betwixt 1 and 2 is the quot arising from the division of the antecedent 1 by the consequent 2 ; namely 5, or one half. Four numbers are said to be proportional when the tatio of the first to the second is the same as that of the third to the fourth ; and the proportional numbers are usually dislinguished from one another as in the following examples. A 1 2 11 161 8 Proportional numbers, or numbers in proportion, are usually denominated terms; of which the first and last. are called extremes, and the intermediate ones get the name of means, or middle terms. If four numbers are proportional, they will also be inversely proportional ; that is, the first consequent will be to its own antecedent as the second consequent is to its antecedent ; or the fourth term will be to the third as the second is to the first. Thus, if 6z3171015. then by inversion, 31617 51 10, or 5 1 10 11 316. Buclid v. 4. cor. By either of these kinds of inversion may any question in the rule of three be proved. If four numbers are proportional, they will also be aleruately proportional ; that is, the first antecedent will tes the frerd confeneits of the seft tereo ilt te or the third term as the second term is to the fourth. Thus, if 8IA11 24 112, then, by alternation, 8124 11 4112. Euclid V. 16. But the celebrated property of four proportional numbers is, that the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the means. Thus, if 2:3 2 61 9, then 2XO3XG2IS. Euclid vi. 16. Hence we have an easy method of finding a fourth proportional to three numbers given, viz. Multiply the middle number by the last, and divide the roduct by the first, the quot gives the fourth proportional. EXAMP. Given 6, 5. and 36, to find a fourth proportional ; put 2 equal to the fourth proportional, then O15113612, and 5N 36 2 180 26XN;, wherefore, dividing the product 180 by the factor 6, the quot gives the other factor a, namely 30, the fourth proportional sought. Every question in the rule of three may be divided into two parts, viz. a supposition and a demand ; and of the three given numbers, two are always found in the suppnsition, and only one in the demand. EXAMP. If a yards cost 12 shillings, what will 6 yards cost at that rate? In this question the supposition is, If 4 yards cost 12 shillings ; and the two terms contained in it are 4 vards and 12 shillings : The demand lies in these words, What will o yards cost l and the only term found in it is 6 yards. The supposition and demand being thus distinguished, proceed to state the question, or to put the terms in due order for operation, as the following rules direct. RULE I. Place that term of the supposition, which is of the same kind with the number sought, in the middle. The two remaining terms are extremes, and always of the same kind. H. Consider, from the nature of the question, whether the answer must be greater or less than the middle term ; and if the answer must be greater, the least extreme is the divisor ; but if the answer must be less than the middle term, the greatest extreme is the divisor. III. Pace the divifor on the left hand, and the other extreme on the right ; then multiply the second and third terms, and divide their product by the first ; and the quot gives the answer ; which is always of the same name with the middle term. When the divifor happens to be the extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is called direct ; but when the divifor happens to be the extreme in the demand, the portion is inverse. The three rules delivered above are indeed so framed, as to preclude the distinction of direct and inverse, or render it needless, the left-hand term being always the divifor; but yet the direct questions being plainer in their own nature, and more easily comprehended by a learner, we shall, in the first pace, exemplify the rules by a set of questions of the direct kind, and shall afterwards adduce an example or two of such as are inyerse. I. The Simple Rule of Three Direct. QUEST. 1. If 4 yards cost 12 shillings, what will d yards cost at that rate 1 The supposition and demand of this question have already been distinguished, and the two terms in the former are 4 yards 12 shillings, and the only term in the latter is 6 vards. The number sought is the price of six yards, and the term in the supposition of the same kind is the price of 4 yards, viz. 12 shillings, which place in the middle, as directed in Rule I. and the two remaining terms are extremes, and of the same kind, viz. both lengths. it is easy to perceive Tds. 1. 7ds. that the answer must be If 4 1 12 11 6 greater than the middle term ; for 6 yards will cost more than a yards ; thereAaUis shillings Anf. fore the least extreme, riz. 4 yards, is the diviA. sor, according to Rule II. soy Wherefore palce the divifor 4 yards on the left hand, and the other extreme 6 yards on the right ; and multiblying the second and third terms, divide their product by the first term, and the quot 18 is the answer, and of the same name with the middle term, viz. shillings, according to Rule III. And because the divisor is the extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is direct. QUEST. 2. If 7C. of pepper cost 21I. how muchwill 5 C. cost at that rate ; The supposition in this question is, that 7C. of pepper costs 21l. and the two terms in it are C. and 21 L;. the demand is, How much will 5C. cost? and the term in it is 5C. The number sought is the price of 5 C. and the term in the supposition of the same kind is the price of 7 C. viz. 21I. which plalce in the middle. the two remaining terms are extremes, and of the same kind, viz. quanities of pepper. It is obvious, that the answer C. L. C. must be less than the middle If7 1 21 11 5 term ; for 5 C. will cost less than 7C. ; and therefore the greatest extreme, viz. 7 C. is the divisor.

From Asia it passed into Egypt, where it was greatly cultivated. From thence it was transmitted to the Greeks, who conveyed it to the Romans with additiortal improvements. But, from feme treatises of the ancients remaining on this fubjett, it appears that their arhhmetick was much inferior to that of the moderns. Number, which is the objeft of arithmetick, is that which answers dire&ly to the question. How many ? and is either an unit, or some part or pans of an unit, or a multitude of units. To a person having the idea of number in his mind, the following questions naturally occur, viz. i. How is such a number to be exprefled or written ? Hence we have Notation. 2. What is the sum of two or more numbers? Hence Addition. 3. What is the difference of two given numbers ? Hence Subtraction. 4. What will be the result or produ Ct of a given number repeated or taken a certain number of times ? Hence Multiplication. 5. How often is one given number contained in another? Hence Division. These five, viz. Notation, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division, are the chief parts, or rather the whole of arithmetic; as every arithmetical operation requires the use of some of them, and nothing but a proper mixture of them is necessary in any operation whatever.; and, by an Arabic term, these are called the algorithm. Chap. I. Notation. Notation is that part of arithmetic which explains the method of writing down, by characters or symbols, any number expressed in words; as also the way of reading or expressing, in words, any number given in charactersor symbols, But the first of these is properly notation, and the last is more usually called numeration. The things then proper to be comprised in this chapter are, 1. The figural notation. 2. Numeration, or the way of reading numbers. 3. Descriptions of the kindsor ■ species of numbers. I. Figural Notation. A w unit, or unity, is that number by which any thing is called one of its kind. It is the first number; and if to it be added another unit, we fttall have another number called two; and if to this last another unit be added, we {hall have another number called three ; and thus, by the continual addition of an unit, therewill arise an infinite increase of numbers. On the otherhand, if from unity any part be fubtra Cled, and again from that part another part be taken away, and this Be done continually, we {hall have an infinite decrease of numbers. But though number, with-relpe Cl: to increase-and decrease, be infinite, and knows no limits ; yet ten figures, variously combined or repeated, are found fuffident to exp ress any number, whatsoever. Theft,, with the method of notation by them, were originally invented by some of the eastern nations, probably the Indians; afterwards improved by the Arabians; and at last brought over to Europe, particularly into Britain, betwixt the tenth and twelfth century. From the ten fingers of the hands, on which it hath been usual to compute numbers, figures were called digiti. Their form, order, and value, are as follows : 1 One, an unit, or unity, 2 l vtwo, 3 three, 4 four, j five, 6 six, 7 seven, 8 eight, 9 nine, o cipher, nought, null, or nothing. Of theft, the first nine, in contradiftin Ction to the cipher, are ca\\\\\\\\ed. Jignificant figures. The value of the figures now assigned is called their Jimple value, as being that which they have in themftlves, or when they stand alone. But when two or more figures are joined as in a line, the figures then receive also a local value from the place in which they stand, reckoning the order of places from the right-hand towards the left, thus, 777777777777 A figure {landing in the first place has only its simple value ; but a figure in the second place has ten times the value it would have in the first place; and a figure in the third place has ten times the value it would have in the second place; and universally a figure in any superior place has ten times the value it would have in the next inferior place. Hence it is plain, that a figure in the first place limply signifies so many units as the figure exprefles; but the same figure advanced to the second place will signify so many tens; in the third place, it will fignjfy so many hundreds; in the fourth place, so many thousands; in the fifth place, so many ten thousands; in the sixth place, so many hundred thousands; and in the seventh place, so many millions, e5rc. Thus, 7 in the first place, will denote seven units; in the second place, ftven tens, or seventy; in the third place, seven hundred; in the fourth place,, ftven thousand, <bc. Every three places, reckoning from the right-hand, make a half period; and the right-hand figures of these half-periods are termed units and thousands by turns; the middle figure is always tens, and the left-hand figure always hundreds. Two half-periods, or six places, make a full period *, and the periods, reckoning from the right-hand towards the left, are titled as follows, viz. the first is the period of units \\' , the second, that of millions; the third is titled bimilliom r or bilfions; the fourth, trimillions, or trillions ; the fifth, quadrillions; the sixth, quintillions; the ftventh fextillions; the feptillions; the ninth, * oftillions; the tenth, nonillions, &c. Half-periods are usually diftinguilhed from one another by a comma, and full periods by a point or colon; as in the following TABLE.36S A R I T H M of hundreds, and you will find the sum or total to be 687. Examp. II. Having placed the numbers, units under units, 6\\'c. as in the margin, say 2 and 1 make 3, and 3 make 6, and 4 make 10; which 5074 being just 1 ten, and nothing over, set the right9803 hand figure o in the place of units ; and because 7541 ten in any lower place makes but one in the next 862 superior place, carry 1 ten, as diredted in Rule II. saying, 1 ten, coiledfed out of the units, and 6 24180 tens, make 7 tens, and 4 make 11, and o makes but still 11, ajrd 7 make 18 ; here again set down the righthand figure 8, in the place of tens, and carry the remaining figure 1, being 1 hundred, to the next place, viz. that of hundreds ; and having in like manner added up this Column, the amount is 31 ; set down die righthand figure 1 in the place of hundreds, and carry the remaining figure 3 to the next place or column ; which being alio added, amounts to 24; set the right-hand figure 4 below, in its proper place, and the remaining figure 2, which belongs to the next place, set on the left hand, there being no figure in the next place to which it can be carried. So the sum or total is 24180. II. Addition of the partr of integers, such -as fbillings, pen:e, farthings, ounces, &c. Rule I. Place like parts under other ; viz. farthings under farthings, pence under pence, <bc, II. Begin at die lowest of the parts, and carry according to die value of an unit of the next superior denomination ; viz. for every four in the sum of farthings carry 1 to the pence, and for every twelve in the pence carry 1 to the {hillings, <bc. III. If you carry at 20, 30, 40, 60, or any just number of tens, as in adding {hillings, degrees, poles, minutes, seconds, <be. proceed with the column of units as in addition of integers, and from the sum of the column of tens carry 1 for every two, or 1 for every three, he. according as 20 or two tens, thirty or three tens, he. make an unit of the next superior denomination. The reason appears plain in the fallowing operations. 1. MON E Y.

Thus, 20 and 1 ten make 30, and 1 ten more make 40 pence; which, by the money-table, is 3 twelves, or 3 {hillings, and 4 pence over; these 4 pence set below in the place of pence, and carry 3 {hillings to the place of (hillings. Thus, 3 {hillings, colledbed out of the pence, and 1 {hilling make 4, and 7 make n, and 9 make 20, and 8 make 28; and because in {hillings we carry at a just number of tens, viz. at 20, set the righthand figure 8 below in the place\\'of units, as dire&ed in Rule III. and carry the 2 tens to the plate of tens. Thus 2 tens co Medted out of the units, and 1 ten make 3 tens, and 1 make 4, and 1 make 5 tens, or 2 twenties, and 1 ten over; and because 2 tens, or 1 twenty, make an unit in the next place, viz. that of pounds, set the 1 ten below in the place of tens, and carry the 2 twenty {hillings. Or 2 pounds, to the place of pounds ; which, being integers, are added as taught in addition of integers.

In the hundreds you carry at 20 ; which, therefore, are added .as (hillings. The tuns are integers; and added accordingly. Vox,. I. No. 16. 3 III. Proof of Addition. Addition may be proved several ways, 1. Merchants and men of bufmsfs usually add each column first upwards, and then downwards, and, upon finding the sum to be the same both ways r they conclude the work to be right: and this is all the proof that their time, or the hurry of business, will admit of. 2. It is a common practice in schools, to prove the work by a second summing without the top-line ; and if thus sum added to the top-line makes the first total, the work is supposed to be right; as in the following example. L. s. d. Top-line 748 15 10I 674 13 ni 835 17 Pi 90 18 \"8 Total 2350 6 3-y Total without the top-line 1601 10 4^ Proof 2350 6 3t Note, This mark + signifies added to. 3. Addition is also proved by calling out the 9’s; for if the excess above the 9’s in the total be the same as the excess in the items, the 347 j work may be presumed right. Thus, to 684 ~%J\\' prove the example in the margin, begin — with the items, and say, 3-J-4=:7, and 1031 5 7+ 7= 14 = 1+4=5 ; with this 5 pass to the next item, and say, 5 + 6=11 = 1 + 1=2, and 2 + 8=10=1, and~i+4 = 5; which 5 being the excess of the items, place at the top of the cross, and proceed to cast the o’s out of the total, saying, 1+ 3=4, and 4 + 1= 5; which 5, being the excess of the total, place at the foot of the cross; and because it is the same with the figure at the top, you conclude the work to be right. , If the items are of different denominations; as pounds, Ihillings, pence, ; you must begin with the highest denomination; and, after calling.out the 9’$, reduce the excess to the next inferior denomination ; and then calling out the 9’s, reduce the excess to the next inferior denomination ; proceed in like manner with this, and all the other lower denominations, placing the hit excess at the top of the cross; then, in the same manner, cast the 9’s out of the total, placing the excess aythe foot of the cross ; and if the figure at rhe foot and top be the same, the work may be presumed right. If any operation, whether in addition, fubtradion, multiplication, or division, be right, this kind of proof will always Ihow it to be so; but if an operation be wrong, by a figure or figures being misplaced, or by mifcounting 9, or any just number of 9’s, this kind of proof will not difoover the mistake. 5 A 3 Chap,A R I T H Chap: HI. Subtraction. Subtraction is the taking a lesser number from a greater,, in order to discover their difference, or the remainder. I. Suit raft ion of Integers. Rule I. Set figures of like place under other, r/z. units under units, tens under tens, <bc. and the greater of the given numbers uppermost. II. Beginning at the place of units, take the lower figures from those abpve, borrowing and paying ten, as need requires, and write the remainders below. Examp. I. Because firailar or like things only can be fubtrafted, place the 867 major, or minuend. numbers as directed in 562 minor, or fubtrahend. -Rule I. viz. units under units, tens under tens, 305difference, or remainder, \\'be. and the greatest uppermoff, as in the margin. Then, beginning at the place of units, say, 2 units from 7 units, and 5 units remain ; which set below in the •jdace of units; then 6 tens from 6 tens, and nothing remains ; wherefore set o below, in the place of tens; then 5 hundred from 8 hundred, and 3 hundred remain ; which set below, in the place of hundreds ; and you will find the total difference or remainder to be 305. II. Having placed the numbers, units under units, be. as in the margin, say, 5 units from 2 units, you 7432 cannot, but, because an unit in the next superior 2.785. place makes ten in this place, you muff borrow 1, viz. 1 ten, from thefaid next place, as direc4647 ted in Rule II. ; which 1 ten being added to 2 makes 12 ; then say, 5 from 12, and 7 remains ; which 7 set below in the place of units ; then proceed, and pay the unit borrowed, either by esteeming 3, the next figure in the major, to be only 2, or, which is more usual, and the same in effett, by adding 1 to the next figure in the minor, thus, 1 that you borrowed and 8 make 9, from 3 you cannot, but, borrowing as before, ■ jou say, 9 from 13 and 4 remains; which 4 set below: proceed, and say, 1 that you borrowed and 7 make 8, from 4 you cannot, but from 14, and 6 remains; which 6 set below: go on, and say, 1 borrowed and 2 make 3, from 7, and 4 remains; which 4 set below. So the difference or remainder is 4647. H. Subtraftion of the parts of Integers; such as Shillings, Pence, Farthings, Ounces, &e. Rule I. Place like parts under other, viz. farthings under farthings, pence under pence,. and the greater of the given numbers uppermost. II. Begin at the lowest of the parts, and borrow ac* cording to the value of an unit of the next superior denomination; viz. in farthings borrow 4, in pence borrow 12, be. as the tables of money and weights direct. HI. Iffyoir borrow 20, 30, 40, 60, or any just number of tens, as in fubtra&ing (hillings, degrees, poles,, minutes, seconds, be. proceed with the right-hand cokimn, as in fubtraftion of integers 1 and then fubtraft M E T I C K. your tens, borrowing, if need be, the number of tens contained in an unit of the next superior denomination. The reason appears plain in the following operations. I. M O Nr E Y. Having, according to (10) (20) (12) (4) Rule I. placed like parts L. s. d. f. under other, viz. far73 15 10 2 major, things under farthjngs, 48 12 62 minor. pence under pence, be. 1 — and in each of these de25 3 4 remainder, nominations, units under units, tens under tens, and the greater of the given numbers uppermost, as in the magin, begin with the farthings, and say, 2 from 2, and o remains; and proceed to the pence, saying, 6 from 10 and 4 remains; which 4 set down, and go on to the (hillings, saying 2 from 5 and 3 remains, and 1 from 1, and o remains; or you may say at once, 12 from 15, and 3 remains; which 3 being set down, proceed to the pounds, which are integers, and fubtra<fted as such. In this example say, 3 farthings from 1 farthing you cannot, but as dire&ed in Rule II. you say, 3 from (10) (20) (12) 4, the number of farthings L. s. d. in 1 penny borrowed, and 708 14 major. 1 remains; which 1 added 170 17 10^ minor. to 1 in the major gives 2 farthings for a remain429 16 remainder, der; which set down, and proceed to the pence, saying, 1 penny borrowed and ro make 11, which from 6 you cannot, but from 12, the number of pence in 1 (hilling, and 1 remains ; which r added to 6 in the major gives a remainder of 7 ; which set down, and go on to the (hillings ; and because in fubtradling (hillings we borrow a just number of tens, viz. 2 tens, or 20, work as dire&ed in Rule III.; and in the right-hand column say, 1 borrowed and 7 make 8, which from 4 you cannot, but from 14, and 6 remains; which being set down, go on to the left-hand column, and say, 1 borrowed and 1 make 2, which from x you cannot, but from 2, the number of tens in 1 pound, and nothing remains, which o added to 1 in the major gives 1 for a remainder; which set down, and proceed to the pounds, saying, 1 borrowed and 8 make 9, which from 8 you cannot, but from 18, be. Note, Some add the number borrowed to the figure or number in the major, and then fubtradl from their sum. Thus, in the farthings they add the 4 borrowed to 1 in the major, and then from the sum 5 they fubr trad! the. 3 in. the minor; and in the pence they add the 12-borrowed to 6 in the major, and fubtradt from the sum 18, be.-, but the method taught above, is the easiest and most usual. 2.

III. The Proof of Subtraftion. Merchants and men of business use no other proof besides a revifal of the work, or running over it a second time ; but it is usual in schools to put the learner upon proving the operation, by some of the three methods following, viz. 1. The work may be proved by addition; for if you add the remainder to the minor, the sum will.be equal to the major, as in the following example. Exarnp. L. s. d. major 73 15 10 minor 48 12 6 rem. 25 3 4 proof 73 15 10 2. By fubtradhon; for if you fubtrad! the remainder from the major, the difference will be equal to the minor, as follows.

By carting our the 9’s;. for the major being equal to the sum of the minor and remainder, if you cart the 9’s out of the major, and place the excess at the top of the cross, and then cart the 9’s out of the minor and remainder, as if they were items in addition, and place the excess at the foot of the cross, it is plain the figure at the top and foot, if the work be right,.will be the same. Only, in proving fubtradtion of money, Avoirdupois weight, <bc. care murt be taken to begin with the highest denomination, reducing always the excess to the next inferior denomination, as taught in. the proof of addition. See the following example. L. s. d. major 73 15. 10 minor 48 12 6 rem. 25. 3 4 T Chap. IV. Multiplication. under the common name of faftors; and the number arising from the multiplication of the one by the other is called the produft, and sometimes the fatt, or the rettangle. If a multiplier consists of two or more figures, the numbers arising from the multiplication of these several figures into the multiplicand, are called particular, or partial produtts; and their sum is called the total produh. Multiplication then is the taking or repeating of the multiplicand, as often as the multiplier contains unity. Or, Multiplication, from a multiplicand and a multiplier given, finds a third number, called the produft,. which contains the multiplicand as often as the multiplier contains unity. Hence multiplication supplies the place of many additions ; for if the multiplicand be repeated or set down as often as there are units in the multiplier, the sum of these, taken by addition, will be equal to the product by multiplication. Thus, 5X3 = 15=5 + 5 + 5. The first and loweff flrep in multiplication is, to multiply one digit by another ; and the fairt or number thence arising is called a Jingle produtt. This elementary step may be learned from the following table, commonly called Pythagoras\\' s table of multiplication : which is confultedthus; seek one of the digits or numbers on the head, and the other on the left side,, and.in the angle of meeting you have their produdt. The learner,, before he proceed further, ought to get the table by heart. To Pythagoras’s table are here added, on account of their ufefiilness, the produ&s of the numbers 10, 11, 12. In multiplication there are two numbers given, viz. one to be multiplied, called the multiplicand; and another that multiplies it, called the multiplier; these two go I. Multiplication of Integers. Rule I. Set the multiplier below the multiplicand, so as like places may Hand under other, viz. units under r -units,.371 A R I T H M units, tens under tens, Sc,.: but if either or both of the factors have ciphers on the right hand, set their first lignificant figures under other. The 01 der prescribed in this rule is not absolutely necefiary, but very convenient as will appear in the examples. II. Beginning at the right hand, multiply each figure of the multiplier into the whole multiplicand, carrying, as in addition, and placing the right-hand figure of each particular produ& dire&ly under the multiplying figure. III. Add the particular produdls, and their sum will be the total produdl. Examp. I. Having placed the multiplier under the multiplicand, as directed in Rule I. proceed to the operation, and say, 7 times 4 94 multiplicand, make 28; set the 8 be7 multipler. low in the place of units, and carry the 2 tens to 658 produfh the next place, as dirdted in Rule H. saying 7 times 9 make 63, and 2 that I carried make 65; set 5 below in the place qf tens, and the 6, which belongs to the next place, set on its left hand, there being no further place to which it can be carried; so the produdt is 658. II. Here first multiply the right-hand figure 8 into the whole multiplicand, as in the former example; then proceed, and multiply likewise the 6 tens into the whole multiplicand, saying 6 times 2 make 12; set the 2 below under the the multiplying figure, viz. in 50456 total produdt. the place of tens, and carry the x to the next place, as direfled in Rule II. The reason why the 2 is set under the multiplying figure, or in the place of tens, is, because the multiplying figure 6 is really 6 tens or 60, and 60 times 2 make 120; so that by carrying the 1 to the next place, and setting down 20, the o would fall into the place of units, and throw the 2 into the place of tens ; but as o can make no alteration in the addition of the partial produ&s, the setting of it down is fofely and justly omitted. III. When the multiplier has ciphers on the right hand, as it would be evidently lost labour to multiply by the ciphers, their only use being to throw figures on their left hand into higher places, set the first significant figures of the fatfors tinder other; and, after the operation is finiftied, annex the ciphers of the multiplier to the right hand of the product IV. When the multiplier has ciphers intermixed with figni Hcant figures, omit the ciphers, 29601847 because the multiplying by them would 300905 only produce so many lines of ciphers — and lb be labour in vain ; wherefore 148009235 multiply by,the significant figures only; 266416623 but take care to place the right-hand 88805541’ figure of each particular product di8907343771535 , reftly under the multiplying figure.

If your multiplier is a Angle digit, set it under the units figure of the lowest denomination, multiply it into all the parts of the multiplicand, beginning at the lowest, and^arrying always asin addition, or according to the value of the next luperior place. Examp. What is the price of 7 packs of cloth at L,. 64, 8 s. ioid. per pack ? L. s. d. Here say, 7 times 2 is 14, which is \\' 64 8 ioi 3 pence and 2 farthings over; set down 7 ‘ the 2 farthings, and carry 3 to the place of pence, saying, 7 times 10 is 70, and 451 2 3 , that I carried makes 73, which is 6 fliillings and 1 penny: set down the Vol. I. No. 16. a I penny, and carry 6 to the place of {hillings, saying’ 7 times 8 is 56, and 6 that I carried is 62, which make 3 3 pc-nds and 2 (hillings; set down the 2 (hillings, and carry 3 to the place of pounds which are integers. 2. If your multiplier consists of two or more figures, multiply continually by its component parts, or by the component parts of the compofite number that comes nearest to it, and then multiply the given multiplicand by the difference of the multiplier, and the nearest com-\\' pofite number: the sum or difference of.these two products is the answer. Examp. I. What is the price of 56 C. tobacco, at L. 2 : 14 : 9^ per C. Here the component parts are 8 and 7; for 8X7 = 56: therefore. Multiply first by 8, and that produ Ct by L. s. d. 7; or, which will give the same answer, 2 14 9!\\' multiply first by 7, and then that produ Ct 8 by 8. 21 186 7 153 9 6 Examp. II. What is the price of 126 yards of velvet, at L. 3 : 8 : 4 per yard ? Here multiply first by 6, that produ Ct L. s. d. by 7, and that produ Ct again by 3 : but as 384 the component parts are various, and may 6 be chosen at pleasure, you would have had —— the same answer, had you multiplied by 20 10 9 X 7 X 2 ; or by 7 X 3 X 3 X 2. 7 143 10 3 430 10 From the above example may be deduced a general and easy rule for working all questions of this kind; and is of excellent use when the multiplier happens to be a number; viz. Multiply continually so many times by 10 .as there are figures in the multiplier, save one; then multiply the given price by the right-hand figure of the multiplier; and again, the first produ Ct of 10 by the following figure of the multiplier; and so on, till you have multiplied by all. the figures in the multiplier. The sum of these products . is the answer. Examp. III. What is the price of 8604 yards of cloth, at 19 s. 64-d. per yard ? L. s. d. Price of L. s. d.

If Price of 8604 yards, 8406 166 S BIf your multiplier consists of integers and parts, the operation is performed by a cross multiplication of the f$veral parts of the multiplier into all the parts of the mul The contents of mason and joiners work are frequently call up by this kind of multiplication ; for understanding of which observe, that The fupierficial content of any redtangle is found by multiplying the length into the breadth ; and the content of a right-angled triangle is found by multiplying the base into half the perpendicular or height. The dimensions are usually taken in lineal feet, inches, and lines; and the operation is performed by the followI. Any lineal measure multiplied into the same lineal measure produces squares of that name. Thus, lineal feet multiplied into lineal feet produce square feet; lineal inches into lineal inches produce square II. Lineal feet into lineal inches produce redangles 1 foot long and 1 inch broad, which divided by 12 quote square feet: and the remainder multiplied by 12, proIII. Lineal feet into lineal lines produce redangles 1 foot long and 1 line broad, which divided by 144 quote square feet; and the remainders are redangles equal to IV. Lineal inches into lineal lines produce small redangles 1 inch long and x line broad, 4hich divided by 12 quote square inches; and the remainder, multiplied by 12\\' , produces square lines. Examp. I. In an area, pavement, or piece of plaister-work, in length 24 feet 7 inches, and in breadth 18 feet 5 inches, how many square feet ? Here multiply 18 lineal feet into 24 lineal feet, and the produd is 432 square feet; then multiply 5 lineal inches into 7 lineal inches, and the produd is 35 square inches, by Rule I.; then multiply 18 lineal feet into 7 lineal inches, and the produd is 126; and again multiply 04 lineal feet into 5 lineal inches, and the produd iswhich added to the former produd, gives 246 Tedangles, each being 1 foot.in length and one inch in breadth; these divided by 12 quote 20 square feet; and the remainder 6 multiplied by 12, produces 72 square inches, according to Rule H. ; thefc add to the former square feet and inches, and you’ll find the answer or total produd to be 452 square feet, and 107 square inches. Examp. II. In an area or floor, in length 38 feet 9 foches 6 lines, and in breadth 23 feet 8 inches 6 lines, how. many square feeti Because the sum of the inches exceeds 144, carry 1 from them to the column of feet, and set down theo The operation may be rendered easier and flxorter by previcufly reducing the fadors to two denominations, viz. inches and lines. Thus the former example may be prop.ofed and wrought as follows. In an area or floor, in length 465 inches 6 lines, and in breadth 284 inches 6 fines, how many square inches The answer here is 1324314 square inches, and xo8 square lines; and if the inches be divided by 144, you will have 910 square feet and a remainder of 98 square Or the fadors may be reduced to the lowed denomination, viz. lines, and then the produd will be square fines, which, divided by 144, will quote square inches, and the remainder will be square lines; and the square inches, divided by 144, will quote square feet, and the remainder will be square inches. Again, the square feet, divided by 9, will quote square yards, and the remainder will be square feet; and the square yards, divided by 36, will quote square roods, and the remainder will be square yards. If this cross multiplication be extended to the menfiiration of folids, the content of which is found by multiplying the superficial content of the base into the height, depth, length, or thickness, the operation must be conducted by the following rules. V. Any superficial measure multiplied into the same lineal measure produces a solid of the same name. Thus superficial feet multiplied into lineal feet produce folicf feet; superficial inches multiplied ixita lineal.inches produce solid. inches, <&c.375\\' VI. Superficial feet into lineal inches produce parallelepipeds, whose base is 1 square foot, and their height 1 inch; which divided by 12 quote solid feet; and the remainder, multi-plied by 144, produces solid inches. VII. Superficial feet into lineal lines produce parallelepipeds, whose base is 1 square foot, and their height 1 line ; which divided by 144 quote solid feet; and the remainder multiplied by 12 produces foiid inches. VIII. Superficial inches into lineal lines produce parallelepipeds, whose base is 1 square inch, and their height r line; which divided by 12 quote folia inches ; and the remainder multiplied by 12 produces solid inches.

Or the three fadlors may be reduced to the lowest denomination, viz, lines, which being multiplied continually, will produce solid lines, which divided by 1728, will quote solid inches, the remainder being solid lines ; and the solid inches divided by 1728 will quote solid feet, the remainder being solid inches; and the solid feet. divided by 27 will quote solid yards, the remainder being solid feet; and the solid yards divided by 216 will quote fblid roods; the remainder being solid yards. We shall only further observe, that as the rules for working queflions by cross multiplication are numerous,, and the operation tedious, it is easier to convert the parts into a decimal fradlion of their integer, and then work as taught in the multiplication of decimals. III. The Proof of Multiplication. Multiplication may be proved several ways; viz. by multiplication, by division, and by caflingout the 9’s, 1. By multiplication: Change the places of the factors, and make that the multiplier which before was the multiplicand; and if the \\\\york be right, you will have 86 solid feet, and 24 foperficial incites into 3 lineal inchesthe same produft; as before; but this method is tedious. produce 72 solid inches, by Rule V.; then a 3 superficial feet into 3 lineal inches produce 1.29 parallelepipeds, whose base is 1 square, foot, and their height 1 inch; which divided by 12 quotes. 10 solid.feet.; and tl>e remainder 9 multiplied into 144 produces-1296 solid inches,, by Rule VI. Again, 2 lineal feet into 24 superficial. inches produce 48; which, being kss than 144, you e2. By division : When the work is right, the prod est divided by the multiplier quotes the multiplicand; or, divided by the multiplicand, quotes the multiplier. But this supposes thfr learner acquainted with division. 3. The most usual method therefore of proving multiplication is by calling out the 9’s; which is done, thus: Call the 9’s out of the multiplicand and multiplier, and fteem a remainder, and multiplying it into 12. you have a. place the excelfes on the right and left sides of a crossproduft of 576 solid inches, by Rule IX. multiply these two figures into one another, calling the Because the sum of the inches exceeds 1728, carry 9’s out of their produft, if need be, and place the excess 1 from thence to the feet, and the overplus 216 set at the top of the cross; then calling the 9 ’s also out of^Q wn ‘ the produ A of your multiplication, place its excess at the : bottom 5 .R I t H M bottom; and if the work be right, the figures at top and : bottom will agree, or be the lame. Examp. I. Here call the 9’s out of the multiplicand, and place the excess 7 on the right side of the cross; then call the 9’s out of the multiplier, and place the excess 2 on the left side of the cross ; next multiply these exeeffes 2 and 7 into one another, call the 9’s out of their product, and place the excess five at the top of the cross; la-ftly, call the 9’s out of the produd, and place the excess 5 at the foot of the cross; which being the same with the figure at the top,. you may conclude the work to be right. Examp.II. Here, in calling the n’s out of the multiplicand, and out of the produd, begin with the pounds, and reduce the excess to Ihillings, and in like manner the excess of the Ihil-lings is reduced to pence, and that of the pence to farthings. The multiplier being an abllrad number, needs no redudion; but if a multiplier be a mixt number, or consist of integers and parts, as feet and inches, fyc. the excess of the higher denomina E T I C K. called the.quotient or quot. As multiplication supplies the place of many additions, so divificn, which is the reverse of multiplication, serves inllead of many fubtradions; as will thus ap. pear: Suppose it were required to divide 18 by 6, *2 that is, to find how often 6 is contained in 18, the ^ work by fubtradion will Hand as in the margin-: by which it appears, that 6 is contained 3 times in <5 the number 18. But this, by division, may be found at one trial: thus, I. Division of Integers. Rule I. From the left-hand part of the dividend point off the firll dividual, viz. so many figures as will II. Aik how often the divifor is contained in the dividual, and put the answer in the quotient. III. Multiply the divifor by the figure set in the quotient, and fubtrad the produd from the dividual, IV. To the right of the remainder bring down the next figure of the dividend for a new dividual; and then Examp. I. Here, because the divifor 7 is contained in 8, the left Divi Divi Quohand figure of the dividend, point it for. dend. tient. off as the first dividual, according 7)875(125 to Rule I; and then say, How often 7 in 8 ? Anf. 1 time; which 1 let in the quotient, as direded in —— ^ i ■ Rule II.; then multiply the divifor 7 by this quotient figure 1, and fubtrad the .produd 7 from the dividual 8, as direded in Rule III.; to the remainder 1 bring down the sol, lollowing figure of the dividend, for the second dividual, as direded in Rule IV.; then proceed as before, and say. How often 7 in 17? Anf. 2 times; wherefore, setting two in the quotient, multiply and fubtrad and find the next remainder to be 3 ; to which bring down the following figure of the dividend, and you have 3 5 for the third dividual; then say, How often 7 in 3 5 ? Anf. 5 times; which 5 being placed in\\' the quotient, multiply and fubtrad, and o remains; so the quotient given number contains is 125. By reviewing the Heps of the preceding operation, and reducing the dividuals and quotient-figures to their separate values, the reason of the rules will be obvious; tion mull always be reduced to the lower. C h a p. V. Division. Division discovers how often one number is contained in another: or, Division, from two numbers given, finds a third, which contains unity as often as the The number to be divided, or which contains the other, is called the dividend; the number by which we divide, or which is contained in the dividend, is called the divifor; and the number found by division, or which expresses how often the dividend contains the divifor, is of the first dividual 8 Set the divifor on the left of the dividend, leaving room on the right hand for the quotient, as in the margin; and then say. How often 6 in 18 ? Anf. 3 times : this 3 set in the quotient; then multiply the quotient figure 3 into the divifor 6, saying, 3 times 6 make 18; which set down below the dividend, and lubtratt it from the dividend, and o remains. is 800; and the feiftdividual Soo parate value of 1, the first figure put in the quot, is 100; for as 8 contains 7 the divifor 1 time, so 800 contains it 100 times, and 100 remains ; to of the dividend 7, is 70; and the se3d dividual 35 cond dividual is 170; and as 7 is contained 2 times in 17, so it is contained 20 times in 170, and 30 remains ; to which bring ffown the next or last figure of the dividend 5 ; and the third dividualis 35, in which the divifor 7 is contained 5 times. Now it is evident, that the sum of the partial qaots, 125, is the total quot, or a number exprelling how often the dividend 875 contains the divifor 7. From the above example we may learn, that there are always just so many figures in the quotient as there eighth part of a t 377 visor 8 below it, signifying that 1 remains to be divided by 8 ; or this part of the quotient may be considered as a fradlion, whose numerator is 1, and its denominator 8 ; and the quotient thus completed Ihews, that the dividend contains the divifor 7004112 times, and one are dividuals; or the first dividual, with the number of subsequent figures in the dividend, is equal to the number of places or figures in the quotient. Hence likewise may be inferred, that no divifor is contained in any dividual oftener than 9 times ; for the dividual, excluding the right-hand figure, is always less than the divifor by 1 at least ; and if both be multiplied by 10, or have a cipher annexed to each of them, the produdt of the dividual will be less than the produd of the divifor by 10 at least ; but no right-hand figure can supply this defed of 10; therefore the divifor is not contained 10 times in any dividual, and consequently not oftener than 9 times. Here too observe, that the right-hand figure of the first dividual, and all the subsequent figures of the dividend, have a point or dot set below them, as they are brought down ; which is done to prevent mistakes, by diftinguilhing them, in this manner, from the figures not yet brought down. Examp. II. Here, because 8 is not contained in 5, point off 56 as the first dividual, and say, How often 8 in 56 ? Anf. 7 ; which put in the quotient ; then multiply 7 into the divifor 8, and fubtradthe produd 56 from the dividual; and as nothing remains, bring down the next figure of the dividend, which happens to be a cipher; and as you cannot have 8 in o, put o in the quotient; and, as multiplying and fubtrading is in this case needless, you bring down the next figure of the dividend 3 ; and as you cannot have 8 in 3, put another o in the quotient, andbring down the next figure of the dividend\\' 2 : Then say, How often 8 in 32 ? Anf 4; which put in the quotient: Then multiply andfubtrad; and as nothing remains, bring down the next figure of the dividend 8, and say, How often 8 in 8 ? Anf. 1 ; which put in the quotient : then multiply and fubtrad,and as nothing remains, bring down the rxxt figure of the dividend 9, and say, How often 8 in 9 r Anf. 1; which put in the quotient: then multiply gnd fubtrad; and to the remainder 1 bring down The next and last figure of the dividend 7, and say, How often 8 in 17? Anf 2 ; which put in the quotient: awn multiply and fubtrad, and 1 remains. TV complete the quotient, draw a line on the right band, and st the remainder above the line, and the diVol. I.

And ftiould any one in this case attempt to continue the operation, the quotient-figures would be all 9’s, the dividuals would prove inexhauftible, and the remaindeis would constantly increase. Hence also learn, that if any dividual happen to be less than the divifor, you must put o in the quotient, and bring down the next figure of the dividend ;»and if it be still less than the divifor, you must put another o in the quotient, and bring down the following figure of the dividend, <bc. III. Here the divifor consists of two figures; and because it is contained in the two lefthand figures of the dividend 78, point them off as the first dividual; and say, How often 3 in 7 ? Anf. 2, and 1 remains; which 1 placed, or conceived as placed, on the left hand of the following figure 8, makes 18 : then say. Can I have the following figure of the divifor 6 also 2 times in 18 ? Anf Yes.; consequently I get 36 the divifor 2 times in 78 the dividual; wherefore put 2 in the quotient, and multiply that 2 into the divifor 36, and fuh^ tradt the product 7 2 from the dividual 7^ and to the remainder 6 bring down the following figure of the dividend 9, for a new dividual: then say, How often 3 in 6 ? Anf. 2, and o remains ; again you say. Can I have 6 also 2 times in 9? Anf No ; therefore you can have 36 in 69 only 1 time, which 1 you put in the quotient: then multiply and fubtradl as before ; and to the remainder 33 bring down die next figurq 4 for a new dividual: Then, because the dividual consists of a figure more than the divifor, say, How often the first figure of tlje divifor 3 in the first two figures of the dividual 33 ? Anf 9, and 6 remains; which 6 placed on the left hand of the following figure 4 makes 64,.: Again, say. Can I have 6 also 9 times in 64 ?

Can I have 6 also 2 times in 42 ? Atif. Yes; consequently 36 can be had 2 times in 102; accordingly put 2 in the quotient, multiply and fubtraft; and to the remainder 30 bring down the next and last figure of the dividend 6, for a new dividual: Then, because the dividual has a figure more than the divifor, say. How often 3 in 30\\' ? Anf. 9, and 3 remains; which 3 placed on the left hand of the following figure 6 make 36: And again say, Can I have 6 also 9 times in 36 ? Anf. No; consequently 36 cannot be had 9 times in 306; therefore try if it can be had 8 times, saying, 8 times 3 is 24 from 30, and 6 remains^ which IS placed on the left hand of the following figure 6 makes 66: Again say, Can I have 6 also 8 times in 66? Anf Yes; consequently 36 can be had 8 times in 306; wherefore put 8 in the quotient, andmultiply and fubtradf as before: The lart remainder 18 is the numerator of a fraction, and the divifor its denominator, to,be annexed to the integral part of the quotient; as was taught in the former example. The preceding operation points out the manner of procedure when the divifor consists of more figures than one, viz. you must take the first figure of the divifor out of the first figure of the dividual, or out of the first two figures of the dividual in case the dividual have a figure more than the divifor: Then imagine the remainder to be prefixed to the next figure of the dividual, and try if you can have the second figure of the divifor as often out of this number; if you can, imagine again the remainder to be prefixed to the following figure of the dividual, and try if you can have the third figure of the divifor as often out of this number, foe.: but if you find you cannot have some subsequent figure of the divifor so often as you took the first, you must go back, and take the first figure of the divifor 1 time less, or some number of times less out of the first, or 6ut of the first two figures of the dividual: Then proceed as before, repeating the trial till you find you have the second and all the subsequent figures of the divifor as often as you took the first. But here observe, that if, in trying how often the divifor can be had in the dividual, either 9, or a number greater than 9, any where remain, you may conclude, without further trial, that all the subsequent figures of the divifor can be had as often as you took the first; as may be thus demonstrated. Suppose the subsequent figures of the divifor to be the highest possible, that is, all 9’s, and the following figures of the dividual the lowest polfible, that is, all o’s ; again, imagine the remainder 9 prefixed to the following figure of the dividual o, that it will make 90 ; now it is plain, that the subsequent figure of the divifor 9 can be had in 90, the highest number of times pof Tible, viz. q times, and 9 will remain; which prefixed to the next figure of the dividual o, makes 90, in which the subsequent figure of the divifor 9 can again be had 9 times, and 9 will remain as before; therefore all the subsequent figures of the divifor can be had as often as you took the first ; ^and if they can be had in this case, much more can they be had when? a number greater than 9 remains. 648|o)89678|2(i 648 2487 1944 (2S42) IV If, as in the margin, a cipher or ciphers, pofless the right hand of the divifor, cut them off, and cut off as many figures, viz. in this example, the figure 2 from the right hand of the dividend ; then divide the remaining figures of the dividend, viz. 89678, by the remaining figures of the divifor, viz. 648, and you have the integral part of the quot\\' Cnt; but to the remainder 254 annex the figure cut off from the dividend, and you have 2542 for the numerator of your fraftion, and the whole divifor 6480 is the denominator. The reason will appear obvious by working a question in this manner, and also at full length, without cutting off the cipher or ciphers, and then comparing the two operations. V. If, as in the margin, the 48|oo)978ojoo(203|.| figures cut off from the right hand of the dividend, happen to be all ciphers; in this case, the last remainder, without regarding the ciphers cut off, is the numerator of your fradhon, and the significant figures of the divifor the denominator. The reason is afligned in the do&rine of fradtions. In like manner, if there be cut off from the dividend any number of significant figures, with a cipher or ciphers on their right hand; in this case the last remainder, with the significant figures cut off, make the numerator of your fradtion; and the significant figures of the divifor, with as many ciphers as the number of significant figures cut off from the dividend, make the denominator. Thus, if, in the above example, the figures cut off from the dividend had been 50, the numerator of your fradtion would have been 365, and the denominator 480. 96 180 144 \"(36) Coniranions in •working Divijion of Integers. 1. To divide any number by 10, too, 1000, foe. you have only to point off for a remainder as many figures on the right hand of the dividend as the divifor has ciphers, and the other figures on the left of the point or feparatrix are the quotient; Thus, 7489634 divided by io, 100, 1000, foe. stands as follows. Quot rem. 10)748963.4 100)74896.34 1000)7489.634 10000)748.9634 2. If the figures of the divifor are ally’s, or all except the units figure, as 9, 99, 999, 98, 997^ 9996, foe. walk as follows\\' : Find a new divifor, by annexing to unity as many ciphers as there are figures in the given divifor, fubtradl the given frorrr the new divifor, and the remainder or difference is the complement. Divide the given dividend by the new divifor, viz. point off sa many figures on diethe right hand as there are ciphers in the said divifor; the figures thus pointed off are to be esteemed a remainder, and the other figures on the left hand are to be accounted a quotient; then multiply this quotient by the complement, placing the units of the produft under the units of the former remainder; again, divide this product by the new divifor, by pointing off from the right hand the same number of figures as in the former remainder, and the figures to the left are to be eftemmed another quotient; which quotient youare again to multiply by the complement, and divide as before. And in this manner proceed till the last quotient is nothing; then add as in addition of integers, observing the carriage from the left lund column of the remainders; to the remainders add the produdt of the said carriage and complement, and the sum is the total remainder; and the sum of the several quotients is the total quotient required. Example. Divide 74678 by 98. New divifor xoo 100)746.98 Given divifor 98 14.92=746X2 — .28=14X2 Complement 2 Tot. quot. 762.18+4=22 total rem. Carriage 2X2 complement —4 Explication. First, to unity annex two ciphers, because the given divifor consists of two figures, and lb the new divifor is 1O0: from which fubtraft the given divifor 98, and there remains 2 for the complement. Next divide the, given dividend by the new divifbr, viz. point off 98, the two figures next the right hand, for the first remainder; and the figures on the left, namely, 746, is the quotient. Then multiply the said first quotient 746 by the complement 2 ; and by the new divilor divide the product 1492, viz. point off 92 for the second remainder, andi 14 is the feconcf quotient. Again, multiply the second quotient 14 by the complement 2, and the product 28, divided by 100, gives 28 for the third remainder, but nothing to the quotients Then add the several remainders and quotients, and find the total quotient amounts to 762, and the remainders to 18. Lastly, multiply 2, the carriage from the\\' left-handcolumn of the remainders, by the complement 2 ; and the product 4 add to the remainders 18, and the sum 22. is the total remainder. II. Divi/ion of the parts if Integers. Here there are three cases. x. If the divifor be a digit, by it divide the integers of the di v idend, reduce the remainder to the parts of the next inferior denomination, \\' and add it, when thus ,vuuev.,l, ’ \\' r ..rts ; then divide the sum, reducing and adding the 1 etnainder to the parts of the following denomination, £sc. \\\\ , It the integral part of the dividend be less than «b for, you mull, j. the first place, reduce it to the parts of the next denomination. Examp. I. If L. 274! 13 : 8 : 3 be equally divided among 8 men, what will each man’s share be t Here first divide the integers L. 274 by 8, and the L. s. d. f. quotient is L. 34, and L. 2 8)274 8 3 dividend, remains; which reduced to 34 6 8 2-^ quotient, the next denomination makes 40 shillings; and these added to 13 {hillings make 53 {hillings ; which divided by 8 gives 6 {hillings to the quotient, and 5 {hillings remains ; which 5 {hillings reduced make 6od and 6od. added to 8d. make 68 d.; which divided by 8 gives 8 d. to the quotient, and 4d. remains, see. The operation may, if you please, be drawn out at large; as in the following Examp. II. If C. 42 :-2 : 8 of tobacco be made up into .5 equal hhds, what will be the neat weight of each hhd ? Here divide the C. 43 by C. lb.

If the divifor confifis of two qr more figures,, andi \\'be-a compofite number, resolve it into its component parts, and divide the given dividend by one of thefeparts, the quotient by another, see. and the last quotient is the answer.. 3. If the divifor consists of integers and parts, reduce both divifor and dividend to the same denomination, and: then proceed as in division of integers. III. The Proof of Ditsifon. Division.may he proved several ways, viz. by multiplication, by divifiqn, and by calling out the 9’s. 1By multiplication: Multiply the quotient by the divifor, or the divifor-by the quotient; and the.product with the remainder added to it, wall be equal to the dividend : Or, take the produdls of the quotient-figures in^o the divifor,. add them jn the order they Hand under the dividuals; and their sum, with the remainder,. will be equal to the dividend. 2. By division; Divide the difference of the dividend and remainder by the quotient, and your next quotient will be equal to your first divifor, without any remainder. But this method is tedious. 3. By calling out the 9’s: Cast the 9’s.out of the d U vifo Kvisor and quotient, place the excefles on the right and left lides of a cross; then multiply these two figures into one another, and cast the 9’s out of their product; add the excess to the remainder; and, carting out the 9’s if need be, place the sum or excess at the top of the cross ; then cast the 9’s out of the dividend, and set the excess at the bottom. If the work be right, the figures < ! t the top and bottom of the cross will agree, or be the same. These methods of proof are a proper exercise to the learper in schools ; but, in business, the only proof used is a careful revifal of the operation. Chap. VI. Reduction. Reduction teacheth how to bring a number of one name or denomination to another of the same value; and i s\" either descending, ascending, or mixt. I. Redudtion descending brings a number of a .higher denomination to a lower, when the lower is some aliquot part of the higher; as pounds to ftiillings, pence, or farthings; and is performed by multiplication. II. Reduction ascending brings a number of a lower denomination to a higher, when the lower is some aliquot part of the higher; as (hillings, pence, or farthings, to pounds ; and is performed by division. III. Mixt reduftion brings a number of one denomination to another, when the one is no aliquot part of the other; as pounds to guineas, and requires the use of both multiplication and division. In treating of reduftion we ftiall conjoin the descending and ascending, the one serving as a proof of the other ; and ftiall afterwards treat of mixt reduftion by itself.

The Rule of Three, called also, on account of its excellence, the Golden Rule, from certain numbers given finds another ; and is divided into simple and compound, or into Angle and double. Sect. I. The Simple or Single Rule of Three. The simple rule of three, from three numbers given, finds a fourth, to which the third bears the same proportion as the first does to the second. The nature and properties of proportional numbers may be understood sufficiently for our purpose from the following observations. In comparing any two numbers, with refpeft: to the proportion which the one bears to the other, the firtb number, or that which bears proportion, is called the antecedent; and the other, to which it bears proportion,\\' is called the confquent; and the quantity of the propor-* tion or ratio is estimated from the quot arising from dividing the antecedent by the consequent. Thus the ratio or proportion betwixt 6 and 3 is the quot arising from dividing the antecedent 6 by the consequent 3 ; namely,2 ; and the ratio or proportion betwixt 1 and 2 is the quot arising from the division of the antecedent 1 by the consequent 2 ; namely °r on e half. Four numbers are said to be proportional when the ratio of the first to the second is the same as that of the\\' third to the fourth ; and the proportional numbers are usually didinguilhed from one another as in the following examples. 4 : 2 :: 16 : 8 6 : 9 :: 12 : 18. Proportional numbers, or numbers in proportion, are usually denominated terms; of which the firrt and last ■ are called extremes, and the intermediate ones get the name of means, or middle terms. If four numbers are proportional, they will also be* inversely proportional ; that is, the sir(t conlequent will; be to its own antecedent as the second consequent is to its antecedent; or the fourth term will be to the third as the second is to the first. Thus, if 6 : 3 :: 10 : 5, then by inversion, 3 : 6 :: 5 : 10, or 5 : 10 :: 3 : 6. Euclid v. 4. cor. By either of these kinds of inveifioa may anyqueftion in the rule of three be proved. If four numbers are proportional, they will also be alternately proportional; that is, the first antecedent will 5 D bebe to the second antecedent as the iirft consequent is to the feeond consequent; or the firfl: term will be to the third term as the second term is to the fourth. Thus, if 8 : 4 :: 24 : 12, then, by alternation, 8 : 24 :: 4 : 12. Euclid v. 16. But the celebrated property of four proportional numbers is, that the produdt of the extremes is equal to the produft of the means. Thus, if 2 : 3 :: 6 : 9, then 2X9 = 3X6=18. Euclid vi. 16. Hence we have an easy method of finding a fourth proportional to three numbers giten, viz.. Multiply the middle number by the last, and divide the produft by the first, the quot gives the fourth proportional. Examp. Given 6, 5, and 36, to find a fourth proportional ; put x equal to the fourth proportional, then 6 : 5 :: 36 : x, and 5 X 36 = 180 = 6 X x ; wherefore, dividing the produdi 180 by the fadtor 6, the quot gives the other fadtor x, namely 30, the fourth proportional fought. Every question in the rule of three may be divided into two parts, viz. a supposition and a demand ; and of the three given numbers, two are always found in the fupppfition, and only one in the demand. Examp. If 4 yards cost 12 ftiillings, what will 6 yards cost at that rate ? In this question the supposition is, If 4 yards cost x 2 {hillings ; and the two terms contained in it are 4 yards and 12 (hillings: The demand lies in these words, What will 6 yards cost ? and the only term found in it is 6 yards. The fuppafition and demand being thus diftinguilhed, proceed to state the question, or to put the terms in due order for operation, as the following rules diretft. Rule I. Place that term of the supposition, which is of the same kind with the number fought, in the middle. The two remaining terms are extremes, and always of the same kind. II. Consider, from the nature of the question, whether the answer must be greater or less than the middle term; Mid if the anlwer must be greater, the least extreme is the divifor; but if the answer must be less than the middle term, the greatest extreme is the divifor. III. Place the divifor on the left hand, and the other extreme on the right; then multiply the second and third terms, and divide their produft by the first; and the quot gives the answer; which is always of the same name with the middle term. When the divifor happens to be the extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is called dirc£i; but when the divifor happens to be the extreme in the demand, the proportion is inverfe. The three rules delivered above are indeed so framed, as to preclude the diftitsftion of direst and inverfe, or tender it needkfsj. the left-hand term being always the divifor ; but yet the direil questions being plainer in their own nature, and more easily comprehended by a learner, we (hall, in the-first place,, exemplify the rules by a set of questions of the direst kind, and (hall afterwards adduce an example or two of such as are inverfe. E T I C K. I. The Simple Rale of Three Dircfi. Quest, i. If 4 yards cost 12 (hillings, what will 6 yards cost at that rate ? The supposition and demand of this question have already been diftinguiflied, and the two terms in the former are 4 yards 12 (hillings, and th* only term in the latter is 6 yards. The number fought is the price of six yards, and the term in the supposition of the same kind is the price of 4 yards, viz. 12 (hillings, which place in the middle, as djreded in Rule I. and the two remaining terms are extremes, and of the same kind, viz. both lengths. Yds. . s. yds. If 4 : 12 6 6 It is easy to perceive that the answer must be greater than the middle term; for 6 yards will cost more than 4 yards ; therefore the least extreme, viz. 4 yards, is the divifor, according to Rule II. 4)72(18 (hillings Anf. 33 32 (°) Wherefore place the divifor 4 yards on the left hand, and the other extreme 6 yards on the right; and multiplying the second and third terms, divide their produd by the first term, and the quot 18 is the answer, and of the same name with the middle term, viz. (hillings, according to Rule III. And because the divifor is the extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is dired. Quest. 2. If 7C. of pepper cost 211. how much will 5 C. cost at that rate ? The supposition in this question is, that 7 C. of pepper costs 211. and the two terms in it are 7 C. and 21 1.; the demand is, How much will 5 Ccoft ? and the term in it is 5C. The number fought is the price of $ C. and the term in the supposition of the same kind is the price of 7C. viz. 211. which place in the middle. The two remaining terms are extremes, and of the same kind, viz. quantities of pepper. It is obvious, that the answer C, L. C. must be less than the middle If 7 : 21 :: 5 term; for 5 C. will cost less than 5 7 C.; and therefore the greatest extreme, u/z. 7 C. h the divifor. 7)105(15 /. Anf 7 35 35 (”) Accordingly place the divifor 7C. on the left hand, and the other extreme 5C. on the right; and having multiplied the second and third terms, divide their product bythe fir H: term, and the quot 15 is the answer, of the same name with the middie term, viz. L. Sterling. And because the divifor happens to be the extreme in the supposition, the proportion is direst. Quest. 3. If 13 yards of velvet cost L. 21, what will 27 yards cod at that rate ? If 13 : 21 :: 27 # Rem. 4s. — pens to be a remainRem. 9 d. der, it may be redu4 ced to the next in13)36.(2^ and *the operation 26 continued, as in the — margin ; and in this Rem. 10 f. case the quot will\\' confirt of two or L. s. d. r 30 Jnf. 4312. 3 24t * Rem. 4 s. Such remainders are always of the same name with the preceding part of the quot. Thus, the first remainder 8, and the first part of the quot 43,-are both pounds ; and the second remainder 4, and the second part of the quot 12, are both {hillings; and the third remainder 9,, and the third part of the quot 3, are both pence; and the. fourth remainder 10, and the fonrth part of the quot 2, are both farthings. As we have no money under farthings, the last remainder cannot be reduced any lower;\\' so there remains 10 farthings to be divided by 13 ; that is,‘there is wanting to complete the quot, the thirteenth part of: 10 farthings, or the thirteenth part of every remaining farthing; • that is, ten thirteenth parts of one farthing; so you set the remainder 10 aboye, and the divifor 13 below a line drawn between them, in the form of a fraftion, of which the remainder ia the numerator, . and the divifor the deII. The Simple Rule of Three Inverfe. Quest, i. If 8 men can do a piece of work in 12. days, in how many days will 16 men do the same ? In this question the supposition is, If 8 men do a piece of work in 12 days, and the two terms contained in it are 8 men and 12 days: The demand lies in these words. In how many days will 16 men do the same-? and theonly term contained in it is 16 men. The number fought here is the days in which 16 men will\\'do the work, and the term in the supposition of the feme kind is 12 days; wherefore I place 12 days as the middle term, according to Rule I. the two remaining 16 : 12 : : 8 terms are extremes, and of the same kind, viz, both o P It is obvious that the answer must be less than the middle term; for 16 men will do the work in fewer days than 8 men; and therefore, by Rule II. the greatest extreme, viz. 16, is the divifor ; which place on the left hand, and the other extreme on the right, as directed in Rule III. Then multiplying the second andthird, and dividing their produdt by the first, the quot comes out in days; that is, of the same name with the And because the extreme found in the demand happens to be the divifor, the proportion is inverfe.

If 36 yards be a rood of mason-work, at 3 feet high, how many yards will make a rood at 9 feeta 9 : 36 :: 3 Sect. II. The Compound Rule of Three. The Compound Rule of Three, from five given numbers finds a sixth, or from seven given numbers finds an eighth, or from eleven finds a twelfth, <bc. This rule easily and naturally admits of fubdivifions, which, from the number of the terms given, may be denominated the rule of Five, the rule of Seven, the rule of Nine, the rule of Eleven, Questions in the Compound rule of three are also resolved into two parts, viz. a supposition and a demand. If five terms be given, threeof these are always found in the supposition, and two in the demand; if seven ■ terms be given; four of these are in the supposition, and three in the demand; if nine terms are given, five of these are in the supposition, and four in the demand; if eleven terms be given, six of these are in the supposition, and five in the demand, <bc. The supposition and demand being dillinguilhed, proceed to slate the question; that-is, to put the terms in due order for operation, as the following rules diredh Rule I.

Out of each similar pair, joined with the middle term, form a simple question; and in each Ample que-^ (lion, so formed, find the divifor; viz. consider from the nature of the quest on,. whether the answer must be treater or less than the middle term; and if the answer T I C K. how many bushels will 20 horses eat i •i4r The supposition in this question is, If 14 horses eat 56 bulhels in 16 days; and the three terms contained in it are, 14 horses, 56 bulhels, and 16 days: The demand is, How many bulhels will 20 horles eat in 24 days? and the two tern^contained in it are 20 horses, and 24 days. The-number fought is bulhels, and the term in the inu!i be greater, the least extreme is the divifor; but if. supposition of the same kind is 56 bulhels; wherefore, n \\' \\' r \\' :Jji-* according to Rule I. place 56 bulhels in the middle. The remaining four terms are extremes, which you class into similar pairs, by making each pair consist iof one term taken from the supposition, and another of the same kind taken from the demand. Thus, 14 horses, and the answer must be less than the middle term, the greatest extreme is the divifor. III. Place all the divifors on the left hand, and the other extremes on the right; then multiply the divifors, or extremes on the left, continually, for a divifor, and multiply the extremes bn the right hand and the middle 20 horses make one pair; again, 16 days, and 24 days term, continually, for a dividend; and, laltly, divide make another pair. the dividend by the divifor; and the quot is the answer. Out of the several similar pairs, joined with the midof the same name with-the middle term. die term, you form so many simple questions, according The answer to questions in the compound rule o£ to Rule II. viz. by saying, three may also be had by working the simple questions 1. If 14 horses eat 56 bulhels in a certain number of separately, or by themselves, in the following manner. The middle term, with any one pair of similar extremes, make the first fimpie question, and the answer to this question must be made the middle term to the fume ? next similar pair of extremes; and the answer to this second question, must in like manner be made the middle term to the following similar pair of extremes, 6c.; and the answer to the last simple question is the number fought. But the joint operation prescribed in Rule III. is the shorter as well as the easier method; for in working some of the simple questions, there may happen to be a remainder, and consequently the middle term of the next simple question will have some.fradional part; which inconveniency is avoided by working jointly. In every simple question, when the divifor is an extreme found in the supposition, \\' the proportion is direst; but when the divifor is an extreme found in the demand, the proportion is inverfe. The three rules delivered above are indeed so calculated, as to make no difference between direst and inverfe, or so as to render that diftindtion needless, the left-hand extremes being all divifors ; but yet, as questions consisting entirely of diredt proportions are the plained and easiest, it will be proper, in the lirft place, to exemplify the rules by queftiohs of the diredt kind, and afterwards introduce such as are inverfe. And as questions in the rule of five are by far more numerous, and occur much oftener, than quellions in the rule of seven, nine, or eleven; we (hall, fiiftof all, give questions in the rule of five, wherein both proportions are diredt; then those wherein one or both proportions are inverfe ; and, lastly, give a few examples of the rules of seven, nine, and eleven. I. The Rule of Five Dir est. Quest, i. If 14 horses eat 56 bulhels of corp in days, how many bu/hels will 20 horses eat in the same time ? 2. If 16 days eat up, or consume, 5:6, or any other number ofbulhels, how many bulhels will 24 days con In the first simple question it is obvious, that the answer will be greater than the middle term ; for 20 horses will eat more bulhels than 14 horses will do in the same time; and so the least extreme, viz. 14, is the divifor; and because 14 is an extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is diredt. In the second simple question it is also plain, that the answer will be greater than the middle term ; for 24 days will consume more bulhels than 16 days; and consequently the least extreme, viz. 16, is the divifor; and because 16 is an extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is diredl.

According to Rule III. place the divifews on the left hand, and the other extremes on the right, and both of them under one another, so that the two upper ones make a pair, or be of one kind, and the two lower ones make another pair, or be of one kind; and no matter which of the pairs be uppermost: then multiply the divifors, or the extremes on the left hand, for a divifor; and again multiply the extremes on the right, and the middle term, continually, for a dividend; and dividing Anf. 120 bulhels. the dividend by the divifor, the quot or answer comes out of the same name with the middle term, viz. 120 bulhels.

H2 ~) Anf, 120 bulhels, as before. II. The Rule of Five Inverfe. The questions that fall under this rule have commonly one of the proportions inverfe, and the other direst, and sometimes the upper, and sometimes the lower, is the inverfe proportion; and in some few questions both proportions are inverfe. Now, though the three rules delivered above make^no difference betwixt direst and inverfe ; yet, to bring the learner to some measure of acquaintance with this useful diftindtion, we sh^JI, in stating the following questions, expose the same to view, by affixing an afteriflt to the extremes of every inverfe proportion. ^ueji. If 14 horses eat 56 bushels of corn in 16 days, in how many days will 20 horses eat 120 bulhels at that rate ? In this question the supposition is, that 14 horses eat 56 bulhels in 16 daysj and the demand is. In how many days 20 horses will eat 120 bulhels. The number fought is days, and the term in the supposition of the same kind is 16 days; and accordingly place 16 days in the middle. The remaining four terms are extremes; which class into similar pairs, by making each pair confilt of one term taken from the fuppolition, and another of the same kind taken from the demand. Thus, 14 horses and 20 horses make one pair; again, 56 bulhels and 120 bulhels make another pair. Out of the similar pairs, joined with the middle term, form so many simple questions; namely, 1. If 14 horses eat a certain number of bulhels in 16 days, in how many days will 20 horses eat the same quantity ? 2. If 56 bulhels are eat up in 16 days, in how many days will 120 bulhels be eat up by the same eaters ? In the first simple queftibn it is plain, that the answer mu st be less than the middle term; for 20 horses will ,eat the same number of bulhels in fewer days than 14 horses; and so the greatest extreme, viz. 20, is the divifor; and because 20 is an extreme found in the demand, the proportion is inyerfe. In the second simple question it is also obvious, that the answer must be greater than the middle term ; for 120 bulhels will require more days to be eat up in than 56 bulhels ; and therefore the least extreme, viz 56, is the divifor; and because 56 is an extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is direst. Von. I. No. 17. 3 We now proceed to state the question, by placing the divi* 21 fors on the left hand, bulh. 56 and the other ex— tremes on the right; 112 then multiply and divide, as diredted in Rule HI. and the answer comes out of the same name with the middle term, viz. 24 days.

This question belongs to the rule of seven, the number fought is days, and the term of the same kind in the supposition is 6 days, which place in the middle. T he remaining six terms are extremes, which dais into similar pairs, by taking one term of each pair out of the supposition, and another of the same kind out of the demand. 5 E OutOut of the finaikr pairs, joined with the middle terra, form so many limple questions, in each of which you find the divifor by Rule II.; then place the divifors on the left hand, and the other extremes on the right, as dise&ed in Rule III. and multiply and divide, as follows.

Anf. 12X8 96 We shall conclude by observing, that every compound question, whether in the rule of five, seven, nine, or eleven, dtr. properly speaking, consists but of three given terms. For the first term, or divifor, is to be considered as one\\' compound term made up, or produced, by the continual multiplication of the extremes on the left hand, as so many component pans. In like manner, the third term is to be considered as one compound term, made up by the continual multiplication of the extremes: „ on the right, as component parts. Suppose the question to be, If L. 100 in 12 months gain L. j intcreft, what will L. 75 gain in 19 months ? Here it is obvious, that it is neither the L. 100 principal, nor the 12 months of time, taken separately, that gains the L. 5 interest, but both contribute their lhare; that is, they conspire, as joint causes, to produce one effedl; and therefore their product, viz. the first term, is to be considered. as the cause producing the effedf; that is, the first term, viz. 100 X 12, causeth, produceth, or gains L. 5 of interest. And in like manner, the produdt of the extremes on the right hand, or the third term, viz. 75 X 9, is to be esteemed the cause that produceth a similar esse<st; that is, gains a like sum of interest, namely, the fourth term, or answer. In reference to this way of considering the first and third tarns, the question might be stated as under. If 100 X 12 : 5 : : 75 X 9 Chap. VIII. Fellowship.

When, in any question there happen to be remainders, they must be reduced equally low, so as to. be all of one name ; and then their sum will be either equal to the divifor, or exact!y double, triple, <bc, of it: and accordingly x, 2, 3, 6r. carried from the sum of the remainders, and added to the particular gains,, will make up the total gain ; or the divifor will always divide the sum of the remainders exaftly, and the quot added to the particular gains will give the total gain. Note 2. When the partners have equal shares of flock or capital, their lhares of gain,, loss, or neat proceeds, is found readily by dividing the total gain, loss, (drc. by the number of partners. II.

A Fraction is a part or parts of an unit, or of any integer or whole; and is exprelfed by two numbers,. one above and the .other below a line drawn between them ; as, The number under the line fnews into how many parts the unit or integer is divided; and is called the denominator, because it gives name to the fradhon : The number above the line shews or tells how many of these parts the.fradtion contains; and is therefore called the numerator. In the fraftion ^1. a pound Sterling is the unit, in-• teger, or whole and-the denominator 4 Ihews that thepound is broken or divided into four equal parts, viz.. 4 crowns ; and the numerator 3 Ihews that the fraftion ■ contains three of these parts, that is, .three crowns ; and . so the value of this fraction is fifteen shillings;. Cor. 1. Hence it follows, 1. When the numerator of a fraflion is lei\\' s than the denominator, the va-lue of such a fradtion is less than unity, or the integer. , 2. When the numerator is equal to the denominator, the value of the fradtion.is exadlly an unit or integer. 3. When the numerator is greater than the denominator, the value of the fradhon is more than an unit ; and so often as the • denominator is contained in the numerator,So many units • or wholes are contained in the fradlion. If, therefore the numerator of a fradtion be divided by the denominator, the quot will be a number of units or integers, and the remainder so. many pants.■ \\' , The numerator of a fra\\' dlion is to be considered as a dividend, and the denominator as a divifor; and the fradfion itself may be taken to denrite the quotient. Cor. 2. From this view of a fradtion, it is evident, that if the numerator and denominator, of a fradlion be either both multipled or both divided by the same number, the produdls or quotients will retain the same proportion to one another; and consequently the new fraction thence arising wrl! be of\\' the same value with the given one. Thus the numerator and denominator of the fradtioh multiplied by 2 produces ^ an d divided by 2 quots both which fx addons are cf the same value with A. Fradlions having 10, ioq, 1000; or 1, with any number of ciphers annexed tc it, for a denominator, arc called-ed decimal fraflions : and fraftions having any other denominator are called vulgar fradions. 1. A proper fradtion is that whose numerator is less than its denominator, and consequently is in value less than unity; as y. 2. An improper fradtion is that whose numerator is equal to or greater than its denominator; and consequently is in value equal to or greater than an unit; as -f. 3. A simple fradtion is that which has but one numerator, and one denominator; and may be either proper or improper ; as ^ or 4. A compound fradtion is made up of two or more simple fradtions, coupled together with the particle of, and is a fradtion of a fradtion; as y bf or -i of y of 5. A mixt number consists of an integer, and a fraction joined with it; as Because in most cases fradlions can neither be added nor fubtradted, till they be reduced, we begin with redudtion. Ttedudion of Vulgar Fraflions. Problem I. To reduce an improper fradtion to an integer, or mixt number. Rule. Divide the numerator by the denominator, the quot gives integers ; and the remainder, if there be any, placed over the divifor or denominator, gives the fradtion to be annexed. Ex A m pl E s. X. *35 = 85 integers, there being no remainder. 2. 4 *. 7 = 544-, the remainder being 5. 3. = 98^-y, the remainder being 10. 4*ttt <S= l Ti t V> the remainder being 48. Prob. II. To reduce a mixt number to an improper fradtion. Rule. Multiply the integer by the denominator; to the produdt add the numerator: The sum is the nume,rator of\\'the improper fradtion; and the denominator is the same as before. Examples. 1. 54b-= 4 1 7 ; for 54X8 = 432 + 5 Numerator 437 2. 98^1= HI 1 ; for 98 X 14= 1372 + 10 Numerator 1382 Pros. III. To reduce a whole number to a fradtion of a given denominator. Rule. Multiply the whole number by the given denominator; and place the produdt by way of numerator over the given denominator. Examples. 1. Reduce 9 to a fradtion whose denomination is 5. 9X5=45; fotbe fradtion is ^. 2. Reduce 36 to a fradtion whose denominator is 4. 36 X 4 = 144 ; so the fradtion is 3. Reduce 8 to a .fradtion whose denominator is 1. 8X1=8; so the fradtion is E T I C K. The reason of the rule appears by reverfing the operation; for if the numerator be divided by the denominator, it will quot the integer, or whole number. Pros. IV. To reduce a compound fradtion to a simple one. Rule. Multiply the numerators continually for the numerator of the simple fradtion ; and multiply the denominators continually for its denominator. Exa m pl e s. Fx.i. *of-£ = -r\\' r . Ex, 2. ’ 4 of y of d = Cor. From this problem may be deduced a method of reducing a fradtion of a lefier denomination to a fraction of a greater denomination ; namely. Form a compound fradtion, by comparing the given fradtion with the superior denominations; and then reduce the compound fradtion to a simple one. Examples. 1. What fradtion of a pound Sterling is ^of a penny? •^d. is ^ of T r T of y^-L. 2. What fradtion of a C. is of a pound ? T 18. is J Of vy = yyyC. Prob. V. To reduce a fradtion of a greater denomination to a fradtion of a lefler denomination. Rule. Multiply the numerator of the given fradtion, as in redudtion of integers descending ; and the produdt is the numerator, to be placed over the denominator of the given fradtion. Exam p l e s. 1. What fradtion of a {hilling is ^ of a pound ? Here, as in redudtion descending, multiply the numerator 3 by 20, because 20 {hillings make a pound; as under. z. 3 * 19 — {hilling. 4 2. What fradtion of a penny is f L. ? Z. 4 X 20 X 12 _ 05 0 J 5 7 The reason of this rule will appear by observing, that every fradtion may be considered in two views. Thus, may either be considered as exprelfing three fourths of one unit, or as denoting the fourth part of three units. Now, if the unit be a pound Sterling, the fradtion, in the latter view, will denote the fourth part of three pounds; and by reducing the numerator L. 3 to {hillings, we have s ; and again reducing 60 {hillings to pence, we have 7 -| 0 d. equal to s. or to £L. Prob. VI. To find the value of a fradtion. Rule. Reduce the numerator to the next inferior denomination ; divide by the denominator; and the quot, if nothing remain, is the value complete. If there be any remainder, it is the numerator of a fradtion whose denominator is the divifor. T his fraction may either be annexed to the quotient, or reduced to value, if there be any lower denomination. Examp.What is the value of ^L. ? 4)60(15$. Here consider 4; L. as ekprel Eng the fourth part of three pounds Sterling ; so reduce L 3, the numerator, to ftiillings, arid divide by. the denominator 4; arid as nothing remains, the quot, viz. jy filillings, is the value complete. The reason of this rule is the same with that in the preceeding problem. It is by the pra&ice of this problem that remainders in the rule of three are reduced to Pros. VII. To reduce a fra&ion to its Joweflf terms. Rule. Divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divifor ; the two quots make the The greatest common divifor of the numerator and denominator of a fraition is found by the following Rule. Divide the greater of these two numbers by the lefler; and again divide the divifor by the remainder ; and so on, continually, till o remains. The last divifor is their greatest common divifor. Ex amp. Reduce 9^4 to its lowest terms. First find the greatest common divifor of the numerator and denominator, as follows Greatest common divifor 50) 112(2 ( Q I . Then proceed to reduce the given fraftib W to its lowcft terms, by dividing both numerator and denominator by 56, the greaft common divifor. Pros. VIII. To reduce fractions of different denominators to a common denominator. Rule. Multiply the denominators continually for \\' the common denominator ; and multiply each numerator into a the d nominators, except its cwh, for the frivcral nu ra r . Vol. I. No. 17. Reduce % and £ to a common denominator, 4X5=20, the common denominator^ 3X5=15, the first numerator. 4X4=16, the second numerator. So the new fra&ions are and -i-J. When the denominator of one fraction happens to be an aliquot part of the denominator of another fraction, the former may be reduced to the same denominator with the latter, by multiplying both its numerator and denominator by the number which denotes how often the lefler denominator is contained in the greater. Thus, -fd\" rr :=: -rr + -rv Here 3 is Contained in 12 four times; so multiply both 2 and 3 by 4, and you have Sometimes too, the fra&ion that has the greater denominator may, in like manner, be reduced to the same denominator with that which has the lefler, by division. Thus, i. + T =: T + T* And 4|+^r+ T v=A+A+A. The reason of the above rule for reducing fractions to a common denominator is evident from Corollary II.; for both numerator and denominator of every fraftion are multiplied by the same number, or by the same num After fra&ions afe reduced to a common denominator, they may frequently be reduced to lower terms, by dividing all the numerators, and also the common denominator, by any divifor that leaves no remainder, or by cutting off an equal number of ciphers from both.

But when a fradtion is fubtradted from an integer, for the unit borrowed, take j from the given integer, and prefix theremainder to the fradtional part of the answer. Ex. 1. From 14 fubtradt 74. Here say, 5 — 3=2 ; so 4 is the fradtional part of the answer : Then say, 1 borrowed and 7 make 8, and 8 fubtradted from 14 leaves 6 ; which prefix to the fractional part : So the difference or answer is 64Ex. 2, From is fubtradt 4Here say, 7 — 3 ^ 4 J so 4 is the fradtional part; then say,. 1 borrowed from 12, and 11 remains : So : 14 is the difference, or answer. Note, When an integer is given to be fubtradted from a mixt nnmber, you have only to fubtradt the given integer from the integral part of the mixt number ; and to the remainder annex the fradtional part. Thus, Rule V. If one or both of the given fradtions b© compound, first reduce the compound fradtions to Ample ones, by Prob. IV.; then reduce the Ample fradtions to a common denominator, by Prob.

Or, reduce each of the given fradtions, separately, to value, by Prob. VI. j and fubtradt the one value from the other. Ex. From 41fubtradt4 s 4s.=4 of =Alby Cor. Prob.

I. and VI,of V.ulgar Frailicns. In multiplication of fraftions there is no occasion to reduce the given fractions to a common denominator, as in addition and fubtra&ipn: onlyj if a mixt number be given, reduce it to an improper fraftion; if an integer be given, reduce it to an improper fra&ion, by putting an unit for its denominator; if a compound fra&ion be given, you may either reduce k to a Ample one, or, instead of the particle of, insert the lign of multiplications, then work by the following Rule. Multiply the numerators for the numerator of the product, and multiply the denominators for its. de V 7 =: \\'T4 := 4T 3 5 ::= 4i Note i. If any number be multiplied by a proper fraction, the product will be less than the multiplicand; for multiplication is the taking of the multiplicand as often as the multiplier contains unity; and confequeatly, if the multiplier be greater than unity, the produ<51 will be greater than the multiplicand; if the multiplier be unity, the produift will. be. equal to the multiplicand; and if the multiplier be less than unity, the product will, in the same proportion, be less than the multiplicand. Thus, supposing the multiplier to be -| or -f, the product, in this case, will be equal to one half or to one third of the , 2. Mixt numbers may be multiplied without reducing them to improper fractions, by work-, ing as in the margin; where first multiply the ■ integral parts, viz. 54 by 24; then multiply, the integral parts cross-ways into their altern fractions, viz. -54 by !■ ,. and the product 27 let down; in like manner multiply 24 by f, and the produdt 6 likewise set down ; then add ; and \" ’ to the sum annex. the product of the two 1 3 2 9s fractions. 3. In\\' multiplying a fraction, by > an integer, you have only to multiply the numerator by the integer, the putting one for the denominator being only matter of form. And to multiply a fraction by its denominator is to take away the denominator, the produft being an integer, the same with, or equal to the numerator. Thus, .JX8=7. F<> r IX-^5^?4. If the-numerators and denominators of two equal fractions be multiplied.crqfs-ways,. the produ&s will be equal. Thus, if ^.= T \\\\., then will 3 X 12 = 9X4; for multiplying both by 9, we have 3; and multiplying these by 12, we have 3 X 12 “9.X 4. Hence, if four numbers be proportional, the prodaft of the extremes will-be .equal to the product ofthe means: for if , M E T I C K, g : 9 : : 4 : 12, then and it has been proved, that 3 X 12 = 9 X4. Therefore if, of four proportional numbers, any three be given, the fourth may easily be found, viz. when one of the extremes is fought, divide the produft of the means by the given extreme; and when one of the means is fought, divide the produdt of the extremes by the given mean. 5. In multiplying fradtions, equal fadtors above and\\' below may be dalhed ordropt. Thus, ^ of y X^ of -£=; v X | X ^X ^; and dropping the fadtors 2, 3, 4, both above and below, the produdt is -f. In like manner, to facilitate an operation, a fadtor above and another below may be divided by the same number : Thus, 1 v r = * v? — Or we may exchange onenumerator for another: Thus, ^Xx-i—t Xx 6. To take any part of a given number, is to multiply the said number by thefradtion. Thus, ^ of 32a is found thus, -^X—°=i X J -~: , = i-X‘V 0 ==L f 0 =200. In like manner, -fof 4J-|, is ■ f X454 = f X J -si = |X ~-=% X -r = L 4—= 3°i. Hence, to reduce & compound fradtion to a Ample one, is to multiply the parts of it into one another. 7. If a multiplicand of two or shore denominations be given to be multiplied by a fradtion, reduce the higher part or parts of the multiplicand to the lowed: species, and then multiply. Thus, to multiply 8 1. io^s. by-^ say, 8l.=8X20Si=i6os. and i6o+io|=i7o|s. = <S -| J and y X 4* — —= 11 s.=L. 5:13:10. Or without Reducing, you may multiply the given multipli cand by the numerator of the fradtion, and divide tho produdt by the denominator. Examp. i. Multiply ^ by A\\'. 3. Multiply 8-4 by 94;. The reason of the rule may be (hewn thus: 4X-£= T for 4=4-f-> anc * ? of tt tt 4 and consequently 4 of xt i ® it* The truth of the rule may alfb be proved thus : Assume two fradtions equal to two integers, such as, | .> and 4, equal to 2 and 3, and the produdt of the fradtions will be equal to the produdt of the integers; for =\\\\ 8 =6, and.2X3—6. I Ttvifion of Vulgar Frallions. In division of fradtions, if a mixt number be given, . reduce it to an improper fradtion; if an integer, be given, put an unit for its denominator ; if a compound fradtion be given, reduce it to a Ample one, and then work by Rule. Multiply cross-ways,-p/z. the numerator of the divifor into the denominator of the dividend, for the denominator of the quot; and the denominator of thfdivifor into the numerator of the dividend, for the numerator of the quot. (44= i T y= It2 • x) 4x V (x-l = 5 A — ST-Note i. Tnftead of working division of fraftioris as , taught above, you may invert the divifor, and then multiply it into the dividend. Thus, in Example r. instead y°u ma y ^y. -fx#—?o—i A= i v2. If any number be divided by a proper fradlion, the quot will be greater than the dividend: for in divifiofl the quot ftiews how often the divifor is contained in the dividend ; and consequently if the divifor be greater than unity, the quot will be less than the dividend; if the divifor be unity, the quot will be equal to the dividend ; and if the dmfor be less than unity, the quot will, in the same proportion, be greater than the dividend. Thus, supposing the divifor to be -£» or j-, the quot in this case will be double or triple of the dividend. 3. To divide a fradtion by an integer,is only to multiply the integer into the denominator of the fradlion, the numerator being continued. Thus, 7):|vi V 4. A mixt number may sometimes be divided by an integer, with more ease, in the following manner. Divide the integral pa-1 of the mixt number by the given integer: and if there be no remainder, divide likewise the fradtion of the mixt number by the given integer, and annex the quot to the integral quot formerly found. But if, in dividing the integral part, there happen to be a remainder, prefix this remainder to the fradtion for a new mixt number; which reduce to an improper fraction : then divide the improper fradtion by the given integer, and annex the quot to the integral quot formerly found. Thus, if it be required to divide 15^ by 8 r say, 8) 15(1, and 7 remains; which 7, prefixed to the fradtion, gives 7^-for anew mixt number; and this, reduced to an improper fradtion, is ^, and 8) y (yr: so the complete quot is 5. If the fadtors of the numerator and denominator of the quots, instead of being adtually multiplied, be only connedted with the sign of multiplication, it will be easy to drop such fadtors, above and below, as happen to be the same, thus: of s=f. Or a fadtor above and below may be divided by the same number thus : v(^°r the fadtors of the numerator of the quot may be exchanged, the,, .W.52? = ^ = ?-= 5 . 6 T\\'Ma Xp 2X9 2X3 ® 6. To divide an integer by a fradtion, is to divide the produdt of the denominator and integer by the numerator, thus: y)s( =^^=5 X 2 —10. 7. If the divifor and dividend have the same denominator, you have only to divide the numerator of the dividend by the numerator of the divifor, thus: ^-g-C^r; for 8. If a dividend of two or more denominations be given to be divided by a fradtion, reduce the higher part or parts of the dividend to the lowed species, and then divide. Thus, to divide 61. p^s. by 4, say s 61\\\\= j$X20s.= i2o; and 120 + 9^= i\\'>9^s.=i^r 9 ; and 8-=m T s l|> 1 \" 14 s 7-fd. stick:. Or, Divide the giten multiplicand by the numerator cf the fradtion, and miultiply the quot by the denominator. > t, Exam*.

Thus, ■ i) T (l\\' > ^o r re^uc i n g the divifor and dividend to a common denominator, we have y? r ) -A (=|. The truth of the rule may also be proved by afluming two fradlions equal to two integers, such as, -sand ^, equal to 2 and 4, and the quot of the fradions will be equal to the quot of the integers.

Reduce mixt numbers and integers to improper fradiions, compound fradlions to Ample ones, and then Work by the following rule, viz. Multiply the second and third terms, and; divide the produdl by the first term ; that is, multiply the numerator of the first term into the denominators of the feeond and third, for the denominator of the answer; and multiply the denominator of the first term into the numerators of the second and third, for the numerator of the answer.

When the first term of a question in the rule of three happens to be unity, the answer may frequently be found more speedily and ealily than by a formal dating or working of the rule of three; and the directions to be obferyed in such operations are called Rules\\' of Practice., The rules of pradtice naturally follow the dodtrine of vulgar fractions, the operation being nothing else but a multiplying the number whose price is required, by such a fraction of a pound, of a {hilling, or of a penny, as ; denotes the rate or price of one. Thus, if the price of 24 yards, at 6 s. 8 d. per yard, be demanded, the answer is found by multiplying 24 by -f, the fraction of a pound equivalent to 6 s. 8d. viz. VX-f^Y^g 1. Hlnce, it is obvious, that to multiply a number by a fraction whose numerator is unity, is to divide the said number by the denominator of the fraction. But if the numerator of the fraction be not unity, you must fird multiply the given number by the numerator, and then dividethe product by the denominator. Thus, if the rate be 13 s. 4d.=eyl. the price of 24 yards is found by saying, \\\\^X-|=\\\\ 8 =i61. j or takeof the given number twice. When the fraction denoting the ratehappens to be compound, the product or answer is found by dividing the given number by one of the denominators of the compound fraction, the quot by another, and the next quot by the third, <bc. Thus, if the rate be 2 farthings^ of jj\\' -y of rjJjyl. the price of 1440 yards is found.by saying, s -—^=y.2o, and 7 T V ) =6o, and 4§=jl. When the rate is expreded by two or more simple fractions, connected with the sign +, the produ Ct or answer is found by dividing\\' the given number fucceflively by the several denominators, and then adding the quot. Thus, if the rate be 3 S -—+ the price of 80 yardsia found by saying, •£§ —8, and 4» and 8+4= J2I. ’ The fractions equivalent to any-number of farthingsnnder 4, to any number of pence under 12, -and to any number of {hillings under 20, are exhibited in the following tables.

The variety that occurs in the rules of practice arises chiefly from the different rates, or prices, of one thing, as a yatd, a pound, an ounce, 6c. and may be reduced to the eight cases following, vis. The rate may be, 1. Farthings under four. 2. Pence under twelve. 3. Pence and farthings. 4. Shillings under twenty. <; . Shillings, pence, and farthings. 6. Pounds. 7 Pounds, {hillings, pence, and farthings. 8. The given number may consist of integers and parts. Case I. When the rate is farthings, under four. Rule. Divide the given number by the denominator df the fraction denoting the rate, as contained in Tab. IJ U/z. if the rate be 1 or 2 farthings, divide by 4 or 2, the quot will be pence ; and the remainder, in dividing by 4, will be farthings, and in dividing by 2, it will be 1 halfpenny: then divide the pence by 12, the qunt will be {hillings, and the-remainder pence . lastly, divide the {hillings by 20, the quot will be pounds, and the remainder {hillings. But if the rate is 3 farthings, first multiply the given number by the numerator 3, and then divide as above directed. I Ex. 1.. 48*9, at t f. Ex. 2. 8347, at 2 F. 1214—3 f. 4i73-i + i°|i— 2 d.

The pence must be some aliquot part of a fhiliing ; and, at the same time, the farthings some aliquot part of the pence; and if they be not so given, divide the pence into two or more such parts, so as the farthings may be some aliquot part of the lowed: division of the pence. Then, beginning with the highest division of the pence, divide by the denominators of the fractions denoting the aliquot parts. In Ex. 1. work first for 1 d.; which being ^ s. divide the given number by the denominator 12, and the quot is (hillings, and the remainder pence ; then, because i farthing is -Jd. divide the former quot by 4, and the sum of the quots is the price ip (hillings ; which di In Ex. 2. the rate i-J d. being an aliquot part of a shilling, the second method is Ihorter and better than the Case IV. When the rate is (hillings under twenty. Rule. Multiply the given number by the numerator of the fra&ions contained in Tab. III. and divide the produft by the denominators. Or, instead of this general rule, take the two particular ones following. 1. If the rate be an even number of (hillings, multiply the given number by half the number of (hillings in the rate, always doubling the right-hand figure of the produ£t for (hillings, and the rest are pounds.. 2. If the rate be an odd number of (hillings, work; for the next lefler ev«n number of (hillings, as above; and for the odd (hilling take ^ of the given number. Examp. i. When the rate is an even number of (hil436, at 2 s. 127, at 4 Si L. 2.5, 8 s. L. 31, 15 s. L. 63, 6 s. Note 1. The reason of multiplying by half the number of (hillings in the rate will appear by considering, that these are the numerators of the fradtions denoting the rate. Thus, 2 s. is x \\\\yl. and 4s, is^l. and 6 s. is-r^-l. and each unit in the produdt is two (hillings. The division by the denominator 10 is performed by cutting off the right-hand figure of the produdt, and the figure so cut off is the remainder ; and as each unit in the remainder is two (hillings, the double of them is the re Note 2. From Ex. 1. we may learn, that when the rate is 2 s. the price is found by doubling the right hand figure of the given number for (hillings, and the other figure or figures are pounds. Note 3. In Ex. 2. the price may also be had by taking -f of the given number ; and in this way every remainder will be 4 s. Note 4. By reverfing the operation, from the price and any even rate given, we may readily find the quantity of goods, viz. Multiply the price by 10, that is, to the price annex a cipher, and divide the produdt by half Ex. 1. How many yards, at 14 s. may be bought for 491. 7)490(70 yards, dnf. Ex. 2.

Q/ Decimals. I. Notation. A Fraction having 10, 100, 1000, or .unity with: aftiy number of ciphers annexed to it, for a denominator, is called 2. deci?nal fraftion; such as, T 7^, 1000 * 1 a oio * In decimal fra&ions, as in vulgar, the denominator (hews into how many parts the unit or integer is divided, and the numerator (hews how many of these parts the fraction contains. Thus, if the fradion be the unit is divided into ten equal parts, and the fradion contains nine of these parts; and consequently, if the unit or integer be a. pound Sterling, the value of such a fradion is eighteen (hillings. We may conceive the denominator of a decimal fradion to be formed by dividing the unit into 10 equal parts, and each of these parts into 10 other equal parts, each of these again into 10 other equal parts, and so on, as far as necessary ; and hence a decimal fradion will always be so many tenths, or so many tenths of T \\', or so many tenths of -Ay of <bc.; and by reducing the compound fradion to a simple one, we have the decimal. Thus, A of Ay of -j ’-j = t\\'A\\'u OrOr we may conceive the denominator of a decimal to be formed by the continual multiplication-of unity into 10, as often as there are ciphers in it. Thus, i X io — to, and i Xio Xto — ioo, and r X 10X ia X 10 — xooo, &c. And because the fraflions -j%, T % 9 0 -, see. have the: highefl: numerators possible, it is plain, tliat the number of figures or placesdn the numerator of a decimal can never exceed the number of ciphers in the denominator. It if usual to write down only the numerator of a del irtral fradhon^ omitting the denominator • and when the nhfner^tor has the lame nijmber of figures or places as the denominator has ciphers, it is dope by writing dbwn the figures of the-numerator, and prefixing a point, to difiingui/h them from a whole number. So is written thus, .7; and is written thus, .2j. The point thus prefixed is ca Hed the decimal point. But when the numerator has-not lb many figuresor places as there are ciphers ip the denominator, the defed is supplied by prefixing a cipher for every, figure wasting, and then placing the decimal point on the left. So T^g is written thus, .03; and\\' thus, .0075 ; and thus, .0005., From this manner of notation, it is easy to read a decimal, or to know its denominator,, viz. imagine 1 to (land under the decimal point, and a cipher under every .decimal place. Thus, .9 is T ® , and .48 is and .05 is and .007 is y-ggg, and .00036 is ; Sp Hence it is plain, that decimals, like integers, decrease from the left to the right, and increase from the\\' right to the left, in a decuple proportion. On the contrary, any decimal figure, by being removed one place, toward the left, becomes ten times greater. An integer, by annexing ciphers, is raised to higher places op the left, and may by this means have its value ir.creafed to infinity. On the other hand, a decimal, by prefixing ciphers, is depressed to lower places on the right, and may by this means have its value diminiftied to infinity. Ciphers annexed to decimals do not change the value of the decimals. Thus, .50=5, and .500=5, for .50= ^=^ = .5; and T 4|?° = ^=.5. Decimals may be resolved into constituent parts, and the parts may be read, separately, thus, .847 = 8 + .\\'04-f .007 =-r5 + t^o+T3^>’ In decimals the figure next the point, being the first decimal place, is sometimes called primes, and the second figure from the point is called seconds, the next thirds, &c. Thus, in .875 the figure 8 is primes, 7 is seconds, and 5 is thirds. From this brief account of the nature of decimals, it follows, that the manner of operation in decimalswill be the same as in whole numbers ; and also, that the-same number may be differently exprefied, according as the integer is chosen. Thus, the time since our Saviour’s birth may be written thus, 1769; or thus, 176.9; or thus, 17.69; or thus, 1.769; or thus, .1 769, according as one year, a decad, a century, a chiliad, or myriad, is used as the integer. Hence arises the superior excellency of decimal arithmetic, above every r e t r c k. other sort of numerical computation; as will appear in the sequel. II. Reduftion of Decimals. Paob. I. To reduce a vulgar fraftion to a decimal. Rule. To the numerator of the vulgar fradtion affix a point or comma, then annex a competent number of ciphers, and divide by the denominator; the quot as the numerator of the decimal, and the cyphers annexedfhow the number of decimal places. Examp. I. Reduce to a decimal ? Here to. the numerator 1 annex one cipher, 2)1.o(.5 and dividing by the denominator 2, the quot 10 is 5, and o remains; and because a single ci— pher only was annexed to the numerator, the (o) decimal numerator will consist but of one figure, namely 5 ; to which, therefore, prefix the decimal point. So *=.5. Hence appears the reason of the rule ; namely, 2 : 1 :: 10 : 5; that is, as the vulgar denominator to the vulgar numerator, so is the decimal denominator to the decimal numerator. Examp. II. Reduce ^ to a decimal. To the numerator 3, annex two ciphers ; 4)3 .o©(.75 and, dividing by the denominator, the quot 28 gives 75 for the numerator of the decimal,. two ciphers having been annexed. So 20 i=-7520 Though ciphers may be annexed at pleasure, yet it is the ciphers\\' used that: determine the number of decimal places in the quot; and at first it is fufficienti to annex so many as serve to complete the first dividual, leaving .room to annex more as you proceed in the operation ; or rather annex the other ciphers to the remain* ders, without giving them a place in the dividend. The first dividual also ffiows whether ciphers ought to be prefixed to the quot, and how many.. Thus, i£ the.first dividual take in only one of the annexed ciphers, the figure put in the quot is primes, and no cipher to be prefixed. If the first dividual comprehend two of the annexed ciphers, the figure put in the quot is seconds, and one cipher must he prefixed. If the. first dividual comprehend three of the. annexed ciphers,, the figure put in the quot is thirds, and two ciphers must be prefixed, &c. Hence, in reducing a vulgar, fraction to a decimal, the natural and easy way is, to place first the decimal point in the quot, and after it a cipher or ciphers, or the quotient-figure, as the first dividual direds. In reducing a vulgar fradion to a decimal, if o at last remains, as in all the above examples, the\\' d\\' ecimal is precisely equal to the vulgar fra&ion, and is called ay?nite or terminate decimal. Id finite decimals, the denominator is always some aliquot part, of the numerator increased by annexing ciphers; and such • decimals take their rise from vulgar fradions whose denominator is 2 or 5, or some power of 2 oror 5, or the produft of some of their powers. See Chap. XII. and Algebra, Chap. III. The powers of numbers are sometimes exprefled by indices or exponents placed at the corners of the numbers. Thus, 2 2 signifies the second power of 2^ and 5 3 signifies the third power of 5; and 10 4 signifies the fourth power of 10, &c. The index of the root or firlt power Any power of 2 multiplied into the like power of 5 gives a product equal to the same power of 10; as appears from the following specimen of the powers of 2, 2 4 — l6 2 s = 32 2 7 = I28 S 3 = 12* * ! = 3125 * 7 = 78i2* 2 X y= 10 1 = 4 X 2*=I0 2 = 8 X 12*= 10 3 =: 16 X 62*=io 4 = 32X 3125=: 10 s = 64 X 1*625= 10 6 = 100000b 128X7812*= to 7 = IOOOOOOO The produfl: of two different powers of 2 and 5, is equal.to the product that will arise by raising 10 to the power denoted by the lefler given index, and then multiplying this power of 10 into that power of the other number which is denoted by the difference of the two given 2 <s X5 , =64X 25 = IO , X2 4 = 100X 16 = 1600 2* X *® = 4 X i*625 = io 2 X* 4 = 100X625 = 62500 From these remarks it is easy to perceive, that 2 or 5, or any of their powers, or product of their powers, will measure 10 or its powers, v/z. 100, 1000, &c. or their multiples, such as, 20, 200, 2000, <&c. 30, 300, 3000, lire.; and such every numerator becomes by having ciphers annexed; and therefore 2 or 5, or their powers, or produdt of their powers, used as a denominator, will divide\" any numerator with a competent number of ciphers annexed, and leave no remainder ; and consequently the decimal thence resulting will be If the numerator of the vulgar fraftion be unity, and the denominator any Angle power of 2 or 5, there will be as many decimal places in the quot as there are units in the index of the given power. Thus, i6 = 2 4 gives a decimal of four places, viz. t V=: *0625 ; and, 125 = * 3 gives a decimal of three places, viz. x -r T =.oo8. When the denominator is the product of like powers of 2 and 5 ; in this case,, such a produft being equal to the like pov, er of 10, and any power of 10 being equal to 1, with as many ciphers annexed as there are units in the index, it follows, that there will still be as many decimal places in the quot as there are units in the index, either of 2, of 5, or 10. Thus, 8 X 125 = 2 3 X * 3 =io 3 =iooo, gives a decimal of three places, viz. \\' T Sot S — .OOI. When the denominator is the product of different powers of 2 or y, find what power of 10, and what power of 2 or 5, upon being multiplied, will give the same produfl, as is taught above; and the sum of the indices\\' (hews the number of decimal places ; thus, Vol. I. No. 17. 2 = io 2 X2 4 ; and the sum .of the indices, 2+4 = 6, gives the number of decimal places, viz. -rvav — And, in general, to find what number of decimal places any such vulgar fraflion will give, divide the de 1 nominator by 2, 5, or 10, till the lafl: quotient be i, and the remainder o; and the number of divii\\' ors (hews the number of decimal places. Thus, -s*^ gives a d.ecimal of four places; for 2)16(8(4(2(1. And gives a decimal of three places; for 5)125(25(5(1. And a decimal of three places; for io)xooo (100(10(1. And -rg-Vsgives a decimal of six places ; If the denominator of a vulgar fraflion be neither 2 nor 5, nor any of their powers, nor produfl of their powers, such a denominator Will not divide the numerator with annexed ciphers without a remainder; and the decimal thence resulting is called infinite, or inter Of infinite or interminate decimals, there are two sorts. For some constantly repeat the same figure; and are called repeating decimals, repeaters, or single repetends. Others repeat a circle of figures ; and on that account are called circulating decimals, circulates, or Examp. III. Reduce to a decimal. Here the remainder being still the same, 3)l-o(..3’ viz. 1, the same figure will conftanfly be re-. 9 peated in the quot. Repeating decimals are of two kinds: viz. some confid only of the repeating figures, such as the examples above; and these are called pure repeaters; others have one or more digits or ciphers betwixt the decimal point and the repeating figure; and these are called mixt repeaters ; and the digits or ciphers on the left of the repeating figures are called the finite part of such deci Pure repeaters take their rise from vulgar fraflions whose denominator is 3, or its multiple 9; and are but Mixt repeaters derive their origin from vulgar fractions whose denominator is the produfl of 3 into 2 or 5, or into some of their powers, or produfl of their powers ; and such denominators may be considered as the produfl of two component parts, whereof one is 2 or 5, or some of their powers, or produfl of their powers ; and hence the finite part. The other component part is 3 ; and hence the repeating figure. Examp. IV. Reduce -si T to a decimal. Here the repeater is mixt, the finite part 15)4.o(.2$ being 2, and the repeating figure 6.We nou\\' resolve sa :h denoiflinator5 iftto their cdmponertt parts, and divide the numerator by\\' one of these parts, and then divide the quot by the other. Thus, 15-5X3. 5)4.0( 8 and 3).8(.2^ 40 6 (o) # 20 18 ~V) The number of places in the finite part of a mixt repeater may be ascertained from the number of units in the index of the powers of 2 or 5. And, universally, to find the number of places in the finite part of such fractions, divide the denominator firfl fey\\' 3, and thefi divide the quot by 2, 5, or 10, till the last quot be 1, and o remain; and the number of divifors, excluding 3, shows the number of places in the finite part. Repeating decimals are ufualiy marked by a dash through the right-hand figure, as in the examples above: But some chuse to mark them by a point set over the repeating figure, thus, .3, .26. The remainder Where the repetition begins is commonly marked with an asterisk. Because arty quotient multiplied by the divifor reproduces the dividend, it follows, that any decimal multiplied by the denominator of the vulgar fraftiofl from which it resulted, will reproduce the numerator with the annexed ciphers. Thus, if .75, the decimal of -J-, be multiplied by 4, it will reproduce the numerator 3 and tbs two annexed ciphers,. Now, suppose the given decimal to be a repeater } fach as .3-, refilling from the vulgar fraflion if the repeating decimal be multiplied by the denominator 3, it will, by carrying at 9.0a the right hand, reproduce the numerator 1 with the annexed cipher. In like manner, if the repeater .# — 4* multiplied by 3, it will, by carrying at 9 cm the right hand, reproduce the numerator 2 with the annexed cipher.. Again, if the repeater be multiplied by the denominator 9, it will, by carrying at 9 on the right hand, reproduce the numerator 1 with the annexed cipher. And, if the mixt repeater .2^ = ■ /(-> be multiplied by the denominator 15, it will, by carrying at 9 on the right hand, reproduce the numerator 4 with the two annexed ciphers. From these remarks we may conclude, that the righthand figure of every repeating decimal is ninth-parts: and the same truth may be evinced by refotving the decimal into its constituent parts,, in the following manner. The vulgar fraction reduced to a decimal gives ^7, 6^.; and this repeater resolved into decimal conftitueftt parts, becomes -xo +-r Jo-+-rouo > to infinity. But if we esteem the right-hand figure to be ninth-parts, we have To+ °f-r?> —t V = + -ps5 = the given vulgar fradtion. And as the vulgar fradlion \\' 4g> ves -i7’ so # 8 ives \\'99 ; tbat is, .$9 = £= 1. And, universally, a series of nines infinitely continued is equal to auity in the place on the left hand; thus, .$99=: E T I C K. I; and .0^99 = .1; and .0099 = .or. and 44.^9 = 45. Hence may be ascertained the value of an infinite series decreafmg in a deekple pioporrion. Thus, T %. + tbu 1 *1\" tu W) — \\' J* And -j^. -f-f C If the denominator of a vulgar fradlion be neither 2 nor 5, stor any power of 2 or 5, nor any produdl of their powers ; nor 3, nor 9, nor any prodddl \"&f 3 into 2 or c, or into some of their powers, or product of their powers, the decimal feftlhing from such a vulgar fraction will circulate. Circulates, like repeaters, are of two sorts,viz. pure and mix-t. A pure circulate coofills .of the figures of the circle only; as .09, 09, <6r. or 18, 18, A mixt circulate has a finite part betwixt the decimal point and the figure that begins the circle; as .0, 4;, 45, ; or .32, 142857, 143857, drr. Some ebufe to distinguish the finite part from the circle, and one circle from another, by a comma, as above. Others dafii the find and lad figure of the circle. It is likewile ufua J to mark the remainder where the new circle begins, by affixing an afteriilc. Examp. V. Reduce T V to a decimal.

Thus, 3X9 , , .7X9 „, i O<9^’ an<, ii X 9^ As the denominator 11, whereof 90 is a multiple, gives a pure circulate of two places, so any denominator, whereof 999, or 9999, or 99999, <5rc. are multiples, will give a pure circulate of three, four, five, &c. places; that is, of as many places as there are p’s si the multiple. And such denominators are all the prime numbers, except 2, 3, and 5,. viz. 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 2 3> 29, 31,, 37, 41, &c.) alfd their products into 3, viz. 21, 33, 39, 51-, 57, 69, &c. Such too are all the powers of 3, except 3 and 9, viz. 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187,. 6c. The reafen is plain : for if any divifor, as 37, divide 999, without a remainder, it will also divide 1000, and leave a remainder of 1, to begin a new circle. To find how many places the circle will coofifi cf, divide a competent number of 9’s by any of the above dfenominators,. continuing the operation till ©.remain ; and the number of o’s used will fliow the. number of places. Thus,,7)999^99 six places.

( i\\'xi(-037, and 3)-^55(-i85, and If 3 divide a pure circulate, the circle not being a multiple of 3, the quot will be a pure circulate of thrice as many places as the circle of the dWidend. 1 has, Mfxt circulates take their rise from fractions whole denominators are the prime numbers 7, u, *3, 17, 19, 23, 29, &c. multiplied into 2, 5, or 10, or into some of their powers, or protkrdt of their powers. Examp. VI. Reduce ^9 T to a decimal. 28)9.o(.32,142857,14 The denominator 7% — T\\' X 2X2, gives a mixt civculate, confiding of the finite part 32, and a circle of six figures or places, whose sum is equal to the produft of 9 into half the number of figures; that is, 9X3 The number of places, both in the finite part and in the circle, may be afeertained thus: Divide the denominator of the vulgar fra£tion by 10, 5, or‘2, as often as poffihle,. and the number of divifors will snow the number of places in the finite part; make the lad qnot a divifor, and the dividend any competent number of 9’s; continue die operation till o remain, and the number of 9’s used will be equal to the number of places in the M E T I C K. circle. Thus, to);050o(:o5o(2C>5v4i ; and; 41 99999 (2439, and c remains. So you may conclade, that die finite part will consist of three places, and the circle of Universally, any vulgar fraction being given, v.e may determine whether the decimal thence teluking will be finite or infinite; and if infinite, whether pure or mist; with the number of places, foe. in the’ following manner. Reduce the given vulgar fra&ion to its lowed terms, then divide the denominator by jo, 5, or 2, as often as poifible; and if the lad quot be unity, without any remainder, the decimal is finite, amd the number of divifors shews the number of decimal places. If the ladquotbe 3, or any power of 3, the resulting decimal will be a mixt repeater, the number of whole finite places will be equal to the number of divifors. If the lad quot cannot be divided by 2, 5, 10, or 3, die resulting decimal will be a mixt circulate; and the way of finding the number of places, both in the finite part and circle, is taught above. If the denominator of the given vulgar fraction can be divided, neither by 2, 5, nor 10, the resulting decimal will be a pure repeater, or a pure circulate, according as the denominator is 3 or 9, or some of the prime numbers, 7, ir, 13, foe.; as has been already explained. Every vulgar frafticn may be reduced to a decimal, finite or infintte; that is, to a finite decimal, toa repeater, or a circulate. For if the denominator divide the numerator with ciphers annexed, so as to leave no remainder, the resulting decimal is finite. If the remaining figure be always die same, the refoiting decimal will be a repeater. If neither of these he die case, yet, because die divifor is a finite number, the remainder at last mull either be the same with the numerator of the vulgar fraction, or the same with fonae preceding remainder, and then a new circle begins ; and consequently the refalting decimal will be a circulate. Because in circulates the circle runs on sometimes ta 16* 18, 22*. 28, 8i, 243, foe. places, and because, in decimals of every sort, the finite part runs sometimes on. to many places, such circulates, or finite parts, may, without any sensible error, be limited at five or six places, and used as finites: for live decimal places* divide the integer into 100,000 equal parts, and all the loss that can be occasioned by such limitation, is Ids than one hundred thoufandth part of the integer. And in most cases,, the decimal may be limited at three places, which divide the integer into 1000 equal parts. Circulates, or finite parts, thus limited, are called ^/>proximate decimals; and are sometimes marked with + or — annexed, according as the right-hand figure is taken less or greater than just : for in limiting the decimal, if you forefoe that the succeeding figure of the quot would be 6 or 7, or any figure above 5, you lefien the error by increasing the right-hand figure of the approxiPros. II. To reduce the parts of coin,, foe. to deRule. Convert the given part or parts to a vulgar-Pros. IV. To reduce adecimal to value. Rule. Multiply the given decimal by the number of parts -of the next inferior denomination contained in an unit of the integer; and from the product point off so many figures to the right hand as there are places in the given decimal. On the left hand of the point are parts, and on the right a decimal of one of these parts ; which decimal mufl: be reduced in the same manner to the next inferior denomination, and from that to the next, and so on to the lowest ; the several figures on the left of the points are parts ; and if there be still some figure or figures on the right, they are a decimal of the lowest of the parts. fra&ion of the integer, and then reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal.

To reduce the remainder of a division to a decimal. Rule. The remainder being the numerator, and the divifor the denominator of a vulgar fraction, after placing the decimal point on the right of the integral part of the quot, annex ciphers to the remainder ; then continue the division til! o remain, or till the quot repeat or circulate, or till you think proper to limit the decimal; and the number on the right of the point is a decimal of the integer exprefted in the quot.

For, in Ex. 1. as 1000 : 875 :: 20 : 17; that is, as the decimal denominator to the decimal numerator, so the vulgar denominator to. the vulgar numerator. In Ex. 1. the full value of the decimal comes out in parts, the decimal being quite exhausted ; but in Ex. 2. besides the parts, there is a decimal of a farthing, viz. .336 f. The decimal of a pound Sterling may be reduced to value by infpeftion, in the following manner. Double the figure in the place of primes for shillings ; and if the figure in the place of seconds be 5, or exceed 5, reckon 1 (hilling more ; and rejeding 5 in the second place, the figures in the second and third places are so many farthings, abating 1 for every 25. L. /. d. f. Examp. i. .718 = 14 4 2 2. .759 =1521 3. .894 = 17 10 3 In Example 1. the figure 7 doubled gives 14s.; the two following figures 18 are farthings, equal to 4d. 2 f. In Example 2. the figure 7 doubled gives 14 s. and 5 in the place of seconds gives 1 (hilling more, in all 15s.; and the other figure 9 is farthings, vtz. 2 d 1 f. In Example 3. the figure 8 in the place of primes, and 5 in the place of seconds, give 17s.; the remaining figures 44, abating j, are farthings, viz. 10 d v . 3 f. When the figures in the second and third place to be converted into farthings are 25, the answer, by inspection, comes out exad, viz. 24 f. or 6 d. ; but in all other cases, the answer, by infpedion, is too great, no allowance or corredion being made till the convertible number.K. ■ 401 number amount to 2. 5;, and afford a deduction of 1 farnominator is 9 for the repeating figure, or\\' 9 for every thing complete.

Case III. When the given decimal is a mixt repeater, or a mixt circulate. Rule. From the mixt repeater, or mixt circulate, fubtradt the finite part, and the remainder is the numerator. of the vulgar fradtion ; the denominator is 9 for the repeating figure,, or 9 for every figure of the circle, with as many ciphers annexetl as there are figures in the finite part.

Phob. VI. To reduce unlike circles to others that are similar and conterminous. Similar or like circles are such as consist of an equal number of places. Thus, .27, and .09, are similar circles, as confiding of two places each. But .63, and .148, are unlike; the former confiding of two, and the latter of three places. Conterminous circles are such as begin and end at the same didance from the decimal point. Thus, .153846, and .384615, are conterminous ; be\\' cause they both begin at the place of primes, and have an equal number of places. And .0,714285, and .7,85714:2, are conterminous, because they both begin at the place of seconds, and have the same number of places. But .81, and .1,36, are not conterminous, the former beginning at the place of primes, and the latter at the place of seconds. Again, .63, and .481, are not conterminous, because they have not the same number of places ; for circles cannot be conterminous unless they be at the same time similar. Unlike circles are reduced to similar ones by the following Rule. Find the lead multiple of the numbers denoting the number of places in the several given circles, and extend each of the given circles to as many places as there are units in the lead multiple. Thus, to reduce the unlike circles .63, = .636363, .63, and .148, to similar ones, ex.148, = .148148, tend both circles to six places, because 6 is the lead multiple of 2 and 3, the number of places in the given circles. In a circle any one of the circulating figures may be made the fird of the circle. Thus, 7.592, may be expressed thus, 7.5,925,; or thus, 7.59,259,; and that sore, without changing its value : consequently a pure circulate may put on the form of a mixt circulate, if one or more: figures on the left he set aside for the finite part; thus,. .72,=.7,27, where .7, is the finite part. That the value is not changed may be thus demondrated. .7*27, = ^f-§ = -5-5-= .72. Hence two or more given circles may be made conterminous, by the following M E T I C K. Rule. Set aside by a comma on the left, as many figures as there are places in the longed finite part, and then prolong the several circles to as many places as will make them similar. Ex. To make .54,63, and .54>63, = .54,636363, .9,148, conterminous. .9,148, = .91,481481, Here, because .54, the longed finite part, confids of two places, set aside .91, in the other circulate, for a finite part, and then prolong both circles to six places, which renders them similar. III. Addition of Decimals. Rule I. Place the given decimals so that the points may dand diredtly under each other, and consequently tenths under tenths, hundredths under hundredths <bc, ; then, if the given decimals be all finite or approximate, add. them as integers, inserting the decimal point direftly under the column of points. The figures on the left of the point are integers, and those on the right are a decimal of the integer, confiding of as many places as there are figures in the longed of the given decimals. The operation is the same here as in Ex. addition of vulgar fractions; for a cipher on the right of a decimal does not change its value: If, therefore, ciphers be annexed, so as to give every.decimal the Time number of places, as is done in the margin, they will by this means be reduced to a common denominator, 3.495 3 T Wi3 viz. 1000. Note, If the decimals to be added are of different denominations, fird reduce them to one denomination, and then add. The reason is, because like things only can be added or fubtraded. Ex. What is the sum of .7251. and .625 s. ? Here you may either reduce the decimal of a shilling to that of a pound, or you may reduce the decimal of a pound to that of a shilling. Fird reduce the decimal of a shilling to that of a pound, by /eduftion-ascending, viz. divide by 20, as follows. 2o).6250o(.03125 .725 ^ Sum .75625 = 15 li Secondly, reduce the decimal of a pound to that of a shilling, by redu&ion-descending; that is, multiply by 20, as follows. .725 1. The answer here 20 is the same as be;. 15.1-; sum. f. 2.0 Apr Roxi\"Approximates. If the decimals to be added run on to a great, many places, it will be sufficient in most cases to use only four or five places, and observe to increase the figure at which you break off by an unit, if the rejefted figure on the right exceed 5. And in adding such approximates, omit the right-hand figure of the sum, as uncertain, but take in the carriage. Follows an example at large, and the same contradled. Ex. at large. 12.2352946 8.15789325 7.086968435 6.32143482 4-75 contratted. 12.23529 + 8.15789 + 7.08696— 6.32143 + 4-75 38.551591105 38.5515 certain. Rule II. When all or any of the given decimals are repeaters, give every repeater the same number of places, and one place more than the longest finite; and for every nine in the right-hand column carry 1. or to its sum add I for every nine, and then carry at ten. * Examp. 7484= 748-3\\' 3 6534= 653.06 844— 84./i 254= 25.8* aT.e’e 15S7t =i 5S7.-^ In this example the sum of the right-hand column is 24, which contains 9 twice, and 6 over ; so set down 6 and carry 2 : Or to the sum 24 add 2, for the two nines, which makes 26; so set down 6 and carry 2. Proceed with the rest as in integers^ The sums, differences, and produ&s, of interminate decimals, are always interminate, unless they end in a cipher. A repeating digit is the numerator of a vulgar fraction, whose denominator is 9; and hence, in adding a column of repeating digits, every 9 of the:sum is f, or an unit, to be carried ; and what is over a just number of nines is so many ninth-parts. Or, if to the sum of a column of repeating digits, 1 for every 9 contained in it be added, we then carry 1 for every ten; but what is over a just number of tens will still continue to be ninth-parts. If in any. example the repeating figures happen all to be reiterated, the carriage from the right-hand column adjufts the column on the left, or makes every ten of them equal to an unit of the next superior column, tbr. Thus, if we imagine a column of the repeating figures reiterated on the right of any example, the carriage from it would adjust the right-hand column of the example. Rule III. When all or any of the given decimals are circulates, make all the circles conterminous, find the number of tens to be carried from the left-hand column E T I C K. 403 of the circles, add this carriage to the right hand column, and proceed as in addition of integers. If repeaters be mixed with the circulates, give the repeaters the form of circulates, by extending the repeating figures till they become conterminous with the other circles. If finite decimals are joined with the circulates, extend the finite parts of all the circulates to as many places as there are figures in the longest finite. Examp. 4 == .428571, = .428571, 4 =.857142,= .857142, tt — .4S> — •454S4J» tt=-37°> = *370370. 2.110630 In order to find the carriage from the left-hand column of the circles, add the column next to it on the right, saying, 7 + 5 + 5+ 2 = 19; from which carry 1, and say, 1+3+4 + 8 + 4 = 20; from which carry 2, and go on to add the right-hand column of the circle, saying, the carriage 2 + 5 + 2 + 1=10; fofet down o, and carry 1, and proceed with the rest as in integers. The adding the carriage from the left-hand column of the circles to the column on the right hand, arises from the flux of numbers; for as the circles repeat infinitely, if we suppose a new fett of the same circles to be repeated upon the right of our examples, it is plain, that in adding them the carriage from the left-hand column of the new fett would naturally fall into the right-hand column of our example. The operation here is the same as in addition of vulgar fra&ions ; for every circle is the numerator of a vulgar fradlion, whose common denominator is 999999 ; and if the circles or numerators be added, without minding any carriage from the left-hand column, the sum will be 2110628. And 999999)2ii°628(244444f 1999998 110630 But, by pointing off from the sum of the circles six figures towards the right, we divide.by 1006000, instead of dividing by 999999 ; which gives indeed the same quot, but makes the remainder too small. Now, that the carriage Tfigure from the left-hand column of the circles, is the integral part of the quot, and at the same time the difference between the true and false remainder, is evident; for the quotient-figure 2, mu Hiplied into the two. divifors 1000000.and 999999, gives two produdlsj whose difference is 2; and consequently, if the greatest product, viz. 2.X 1000000= 2000000, be fubtradted from the dividend, the result. will want 2 of the true remainder. To prevent such errors, and to put the work on a sure. footing, find the. carriage from, the left-hand column: of the circles, add this carriage to the right-hand column, divide the sum. by 1000000, and you will have a true quot,\\' and a true, remainder. The learner may look back to division <o P integers,.a r r II M E T I C K. integers, where the method of dividing by 9,59,9^9, &c. is explained. Hence it follows, that if we add the circles as they (land, without minding any carriage from the left, and to the sum add the excrefcent \"figure on the left of the decimal point, we (hall have the full sum of the 2.110628 circles, both as to the integral and frac2 tional part, as jn the margin. 2.110630, , Pure repeaters, being the numerators of vulgar fractions, whose denominator is 9 as often taken as the digit is repeated, may be added in the same manner as circles. But in examples clear of circulates, the method prescribed in Case II. is preferable. .857142, .571428, .857142, .714285, 2.999999, 3.000000 1.9999, Here the dividual being the same with the second, a new circle begins. *16100 IV.

But in adding pure repeaters by the method in Case II. this cannot happen. By way of proof, we shall here add all the vulgar fractions in Examp.

V. Multiplication of Dec\\' unals, In multiplication and division there may happen nine varieties, arising from the different \\' nature of the numbers that may occur in the operation ; and these are of three sorts, viz. integers, mixt numbers, and pure decimals. Now, since the multiplier or divifor may be of three kinds, and the multiplicand or dividend of as many, there must of consequence be nine varieties; which are these following. 4 Tan integer, An integer may multiply or divide ^ a mixt number, C a P ur e decimal. C an integer, A mixt number may multiply or divide -< a mixt number, Ca pure decimal, C an integer, A pure decimal may multiply or divide < a mixt number, C a pore decimal, ■ Of these.varieties, the first belongs\\' properly to vulgar arithmetic, the other eight occur in decimal operations. But in multiplication and division of decimals, there will occur other nine .varieties, arising likewise from the nature of the mvnbers; which may either be finite, repeating, or circulating. And since the multiplier or divifor may be of three sorts, and the multiplicand or dividend of as many, there must of course be nine varieties; 1 and these are so obvious, that it would be losing time here to enumerate them. Before entering on multiplication, we shall lay down a rule for pointing the prodiidf, which is of a general nature, and extends to decimals of every sort, whether finite, repeating, or circulating.; and is as follows. Vol. I. Numb. 17. g General Role. Give so many decimal places to the produtf, on the righr, as are in both factors; and if the product ha-s not so many figures, supply that defed by prefixing ciphers. We now proceed to multiplication. Rule I. If both fadtors are finite or approximate, work exadly as in multiplication of integers. Ex. 1. Ex. 2. .785 .125 •75 -2> 3925 625 5495 250 .58875 .03125 In Ex. 2. the produdt not affording so many deeim d places as are in the multiplicand and multiplier, the defedt is supplied by prefixing ciphers. The reason of giving as many decimal, places to-the product as are in both sa&ors, appears by\\' cotifidering that the operation is the same here as in multiplication of vulgar fractions. Thus, .785 X .75= To Va X— t-qo Jss = • 5 88 7 5. To multiply by 10, 100, 100, move the decimal , point so many places toward the right hand as there are ciphers in the multiplier. Thus : And thus: .4375 X io= 4 .375 6.875X10=68.75 • .4375X100 = 43.7$ 6.875X100 = 687.5 Approximates. In multiplying approximates, the certain places of the produdt may be determined by one or other of the two rules following, viz. 1. If, both fadtors are approximates, the uncertain places of the produdt will be one more than the number pf places in the longest fadtor, 2. If one of the fadtors be finite, and the other ap^ proximate, the uncertain places of the produdt will be one more than the number of places in the finite fadtor. Ex. 1, Ex. 2. 245.118— .2105264.3529+ 2.875 2206062 490236 1225590 735354 1052630 1473682 1684208 421052 86.5021422 .605262250 In Ex. 1. the integral part of the produdt, vrzi 86, is certain, and all the decimal places on the right arc Uncertain. In Ex. 2. only four places on the left, viz. .6052^ are certain, and all the other places uncertain. The reason of Rule 1. is plain. For if in Ex. 1. we make the longest fadtor the multiplier, and the total produdt will be the same either way, it is\\' obvious,••that in this case we (hall have six part(:ular produdts, in each Of which the right-hand figure will be uncertain, and 5 K consequentlyconfequentjy we ftiail have six uncertain places in the total product toward the right, and also one uncertain place more on account of the uncertain carriage from the column in which the right-hand figure of the lalt particular product Hands. The reason of Rule 2. is also obvious. For in Ex. 2. by making the finite faftor the multiplier, we have four particular produ&s, in each of which the right-hand figure is uncertain; and so we have four uncertain places in the total produft, and one uncertain place more arising from the uncertain carriage. The carriage in foroe cases may affed several columns on the left, and thereby render so many more figures un E T I C K. tions, will throw a light upon the matter, and unfold the reason of the rule. Which takehs follows. Multiply 18.634375 i nto 9-S75, and limit the produft to four decimal places. By the rule. By the other method. 18.634375 18.634375 578.9 A 9-875 1677093 149075 I 3°44 \\' 931 1677093 149075 75 000 130440625 71875 certain. The fiureft way therefore to determine the certain places in the product of approximates, is by a second operation, giving the approximates contrary ligns; for then, so far as the two products agree, the figures are certaim The second operations of the two former examples, follow. Ex. :. Ex. 2. 245.117+ • .210527.253— 2.875 23535 1 1052635 1225585 M73689 735351 1684216 421054 86.526301 .605265125 Xn Ex. 1. 865 is certain, and all the othen figures uncertain. In Ex. 2. .60526 are the only certain places. Because the multiplication of decimals that consist of many places, proves, in the way hitherto pra&ifed, a tedious operation, we shall here explain a method whereby decimals of this sort, whether finite or approximate, may be multiplied expeditiously, and at the same time have the decimal places in the product limited to any number proposed. This may be effected by the following Rule. Under the multiplicand place the multiplier inverted, so that its units place may Hand under that place of the multiplicand to which you propose to limit the rrrodu S:; then multiply the right-hand figure of the multiplier into that figme of the multiplicand which Hands direflly over it, taking in the carriage from the right, and go on to multiply it into all the other figures on the left. Proceed in like manner with every other figure of the multiplier, placing the right-hand figures of all the particular prod& ds direftly under other. The total produft will be approximate, and the right-hand figure uncertain. To make this rule more easily underfiood, the readeir may look back to the multiplication of integers ; where: it was obfetved, that infiesd of beginning with the righthand figure of the multiplier, we may begin with the left, and Hill have a just product, provided the righthand figure of every particular prodnff be placed direflly under the multiplying figure. Now, the working, an example, both in this manner, and also by the rule,, and comparing the steps and refuks of the two opera184.0143-f184.0144I53125 B In working by this rule, you invert the multiplier, and place 9, the units figure, under 3, the fourth place of decimals, because the produdt is limited to four decimal places; then multiply, saying, 9X3=127, and 6 carried from the right makes 33, fcc. In multiplying by 8, say, 8 X4= 32, and 3 of carriage makes 35 ; so set 5 under 3 ; and proceed in like manner -to multiply the figures on the left. The right-hand figure of the product is defective, as wanting the carriage from the columns cut off on the right by the line A B. The figures expressing the sum of the columns so cut off, are so many uncertain places of the product, when the factors are approximate, and on that account to be rejected as useless. The figures* moreover, on the right of the line A B, flrow how far the operation is contracted, or how much labour is saved in working by the rule If there be no units in the multiplier, in this case set the right-hand figure of the inverted multiplier under that figure of the multiplicand, below which it would have flood had there been units. Ex. Multiply .825 by .825* limiting the product to three decimal places. By the rule.

Ex. Multiply 25.8490.13^25 by 42 92235, limiting, the product to two decimal places. 25.849013635. 53*79-24 10339& 5169 2326 tffo. 5 LI LO.764WeWe fliall next torn the decimals of the former example into approximates, and then the operation will be as follows. By the rule. 25.85— +79-24 Common way at large. 25.8542-97+ 103400 5170 2326 180 180-95 2326 5170 10340 Prod. 1110.76+ IIIO.77 45 It remains to be observed, that the want of carriage from the sight hand may fometifnes affedt more columns on the left than one, and thereby occasion more uncertain figures in the produdt than that on the right hand. The bell security on this head is, never to limit the produdl to fewer than four or five decimal places. To conclude, when decimals to be multiplied are long, you may frequently perform the operation more easily in vulgar fractions, and then reduce the produdt to a decimal. M E T I C K. 407 plicand circulate, to the produdl of the right-hand figure of the circle add the carriage from the left, then proceed as in multiplication of integers ; but before you add the particular produdts, make them conterminous, and then add as in addition of circulates. The produft commonly circulates; and then its circle is similar to the circle of the multiplicand, as in Ex. 1. and 2.; but the produdt sometimes repeats, as in Ex. 5.; or it may turn out finite, as in Ex. 6. Here it is obvious, that in multiplying .481 Ex. 1. by 7, the carriage from the left would be 3 ; .481, so say, 7X1 = 7, and 3 of carriage, make 10, 7, &c. The product circulates, and its circle .370, is similar to .481, the circle of the mul3-370, tiplicand. Ex. 2. 7.5x8, •5 Ex 3. 7-5i8, .05 Ex. 4. 7-5)8, .005 Rule II. If the multiplier be finite, and the multiplicand repeat, in multiplying carry at 9 on the right hand ; and before you add, prolong the repetends of the particular products, till their right-hand figures Hand direftly under one another ; and in adding, carry at 9 on the right hand.

Divijion of Decimals. Before we enter on division, it will be proper toobferve, that there are two rules for pointing the quot, both which are general in their nature, and extend to decimals of every sort, whether terminate or interminate ; but unwilling to perplex the learner with too many things at once, we fliall at present lay down only one of these rules ; and afterwards, when the rule now to be assigned appears to be sufficiently exemplified, {hall then bring the other rule upon the field.The decimal .places in the divifor and quot together mufl: always be equal in number to those of the divi-The five following pradlicai dire&ions will make the cause there are two decimal j>laces application of the general rule easy. 1. When the divifor and dividend have an equal number of decimal places, the quot comes out an integer ; as in Ex. 2. 2. When the decimal places of the dividend are more than those of the divifor, the number of decimal places in the quot mull be equal to the excess ; as in Ex. i. 4. and 8. 3. When the decimal places of the divifor are more than those of the dividend, annex ciphers to the dividend, so as to make them equal, and the quot, by diredtion 1. will be integers; as in Ex. 3. y. and 7. 4. When, after division is finilhed, the quot has not so many figures, as, by the general rule, it ou^ht to have decimal places, supply that defedt by prefixing ciphers ; as in Ex. 6. y. If, after the dividend is exhausted, there be a remainder, annex a cipher, or ciphers, to the remainder, and continue the division till o remain, or till the quot repeat or circulate, or till you think proper to limit it; as in Ex. 9. 10. 11. and 12. We now proceed to division. Rule I. If the divifor and dividend are both finite or approximate, work exadtly as in division of integers. Ex. 1, •75).f887s(.785 52J’• 637 (loo 375 375 In Ex. 1. A decimal divides a decimal; and because the dividend has five decimal places, and the divifor only two, give three decimal places to the quot, according to Dire&ion 2. In Ex. 2. A mixt number divides a mixt number, and the divifor and dividend having an equal number of decimal places, the quot comes out an integer, according to Diredtion 1. The reason of the rule for pointing the quot is obvious ; for multiplication gives as many decimal places to the produdt as are in both fadtors; but ihe dividend is the produdt of she divifor and quot, and so has as many decimal places as are in both ; consequently the decimal places in the divifor and quot together mull be equal in number to those of*the dividend.

A decimal divides a mixt number; and the divifor having three decimal places, and the dividend but two, supply that defedt by annexing a cipher, and the quot comes out an integer, by Diredtion 3. In Ex. 6. A mixt number divides a decimal; and because the dividend has four decimal places more than the divifor, and the quot, after tire divfion is finilhed, has only three figures, supply this defedt by prefixing a cipher to it, according to Diredtion 4.

In Ex. 8. An integer divides a mixt number; and the divifor having no decimal place, and the dividend only one, give one to the quot, according to Direction 2.

A decimal divides a decimal; and after \\' the dividend is exhausted, annex a cipher to the remainder, and continue the division till you find the quot repeats. 5 L Ex.I T H M E T I C 35)32.09 5 (. 9 i7 35)* 0 3 20 95(\\'0°09 I 7 In Ex. n . An integer divides an integer; and the dividend being less than the divifor, annex a cipher to it; again, after the dividend is exhausted, annex a cipher to the\\' remainder^ and continue the division till you find In Ex. 12. A mixt number divides a mixt number : and after the dividend is exhausted, by annexing ciphers to the remainder, continue the division till the quot has three decimal places; and as there is hill a remainder, it might be carried further ; but three decimal places being in molt cases, fufiiciently accurate, here you may limit it; so the quot is approximate. In division of decimals, the place of the first figure of the quot may likewise be known from the first dividual, much after the same manner as in divifton of integers, The place of the first figure of the quot is the same ■ with the place of that figure in the dividend which stands over the units of the first product; Thus, in the example of integers in 35)32095(917, the margin, the figure o, that stands over 5, the units of the produft of 9.x 35, is in the place of hundreds; and therefore 9, the first figure of the quot, is likewise hundreds ; and so the quot is 917 integers. To illustrate the rule, we ftiall give decimal places to the dividend of the above example; and thereby exhibit the varieties that will occur in pointing the quot. 3 J 5 * In all the above varieties, the figure o iti the dividend stands over the units of the first produft: and in Var. 1. the figure o is in the place of tens, and accordingly 5, the first figure of the quot, is tens; in Var. 2. the figure o is in the place of units, and so 9 is units ; in Var. 3, the figure o is in the place of primes, and so 9 is Here observe that 9, the first significant figure of the quot, in all the above varieties, as well as in the varieties that follow, must always be considered, in multiplying the divifor, as an integer; and, in pointing the first produdl, no decimal place is to be allowed for it. We ftiall now keep the dividend an integer, and give decimal places to the divifor. -35)3 2°9 S(9 I 7oo 3I 5 ‘ ’ In Var. 1. lay, 9X3.5=31.5; and the unit 1 Handing under the. place of thousands, the figure 9 is also thousands ; and as o at last remains, annex a cipher for the decimal .5in\\'the divifor ;. then dividing, you ggt o to the quot; and because 9 stands in the place of thousands, the quot is wholly integers.In Var. 2. the unit 3 (lands under the place of ten* thousands, and so 9 is ten-thousands; and to the remainder o annex .00, for the two decimal places in the divifor; then-dividing, you get 00 to the quot; and because 9 (lands in the place of ten-thousands, the quot continues to be wholly integers. The process is the same in Var. 3. and 4. Lastly, we (hall allow decimal places to both dividend and divifor. riage may, in feme cases, effect several columns on the left, and thereby render more figures of the quot uncertain than the rule pteferibes. The surest way, there* sore, is, to make two operations with contrary signs, and then the figures in which the two quots agree are certain. , In order to make the reason of the rule appear, it will be neceifary to work an example.

To divide.by 10, 100, 1000, is to move the decimal point one place toward • » he left for every cipher in the divifor.

From this example it appears, that all the figures on the right of the line A B are uncertain and useless; if therefore a way of working, without writing down these useless figures, can be found, we-(hall then have a method of dividing long decimals, whether finite or approximate, so as to contradt the operation, and limit the produft to any number of decimal places proposed. And i this may be effedfed by observing.the following Rule. Write the produdt of the first quotient-figure under the dividend ; and from the situation of the units place, consider how many figures of the dividend must be retained to give the quot the number of decimal places intended; cut off the other figures on the right, and also the figures corresponding to them on the right of the divifor; then fubtradl; esteem this and every following remainder a new dividual; and for each new dividual drop a figure on the right of the divifor; but in multiplying the quotient-figures into the divifor, take in the carriage from the right hand; as in the fallowing examples. ?.r\\' T Divide 95-43275-<M3275 b 7 3-4637528; : and limit the quot to four decimal places.

In working the same example at large, the line A B {hows how far the operation is contraded, and how much labour is fared. But here observe, that by the rule for approximates the certain places of the quot are no more than five, viz. 27.551. And therefore, in all operations of this kind, care should be taken to limit the quot to so many places certain; as is done in the following example. Examp. II. Divide 87.0763264525 by 9.365407024 j limiting the quot to four decimal places certain. 9.3654017024)87.07632164525(9.2976 84.2886613216 278766 187308 91458 84288 In the above example the units of the firfl produd {landing under the place of tens, the first figure of the quot is tens; and hence it is easy to forelee, that six figures of the dividend retained will give four decimal places to the quot; and accordingly cut off all the other figures on the right of the dividend ; cut off likewise from the divifor two figures that correspond to them. At every new dividual, drop or omit a figure on the right of the divifor, and mark the figure so dropped by setting a point under it; and in multiplying the quotientfigure 7 into the divifor, say, 7 times 7 is 49, and 3 of carriage from the right, (arising from 7X5=35), makes 52 ; so set down 2, and carry 5. The same method is observed in multiplying every other quotient-figure into the divifor. < The same Example at large.

Mr George Brown in 1718, under the title yirithxntlica Infinita, and recommended by Dr John Keill profeflbr of astronomy in the university of Oxford. These tables are ftiil extant, and extend from 1 farthing to 20s.; a fliort specimen of which, with their conllru&ion, and the manner of using them, we fliall here subjoin.

Thus, .5708318 the decimal of 11s. 5 d. one pound being the integer ; and .571875 is the decimal of ns. 5-^d. 6-c. Those decimals opposite to 1 being multiplied through the nine digits, make up or compose the\\' rest of the table. The superior excellency of tables thus conftrufted is, that we multiply or divide by 10, 100, 1000, &c. by moving the decimal point so many places to the right or left as there are ciphers in the multiplier or divifor. Hence the price or value of any number of yards, or other things, denoted by a Angle digit, or by any of its decuples, may be readily found. Thus, the price of 7, 70, 700^7000, 70000, 700000 yards, at u s. 5 d. per yard, is found as follows. Examp. i. Required the price of 7956 yards, at a 1 s. j^d. per yard. Yards.

Thus, suppose a table wanted for {bowing the daily income of any annuity, or yearly pension 5 in this case, divide 1 by 365, and the quot is the income of 11. annuity for one day; and by multiplying this quot through the nine digits, the table is conftrufted as follows. The use of the table will best appear by examples; which take as follows. Example I. If one has a yearly pension of 375 1. what is his daily income ? L.

Or, multiply the yearly pension by the given number of days, and use the produdt as the yearly pension. Thus, in Ex. 2. if the\"\\' gentleman’s income for 64 days be demanded, you may either multiply 2.6532 by 64; or multiply 968.5 by 64 ; and then work\" for the product as follows. 60000= 164.3835 1000= 2.7397 900= 2.4657 80= .2191 4= .0109 Decimal table of prims, fecemlj, &c. \\\\P rimes, o S^ Second;.; 7 birds. .0069-* 1 \\' .000578,703, .013$ .001157,407, .0208J .00x736,1x1, \\' 02jf •°347? .041$\\' .0486/ .0625 .0694 .0763$ .00004822 .00009645 .00014467 .002314,814, .00-2893,518, ,.003472,222, .000x9290 .00024112 .00028935 .004050,925, 004629,629, .005208,333, .00033757 .00038580 .00043402 >007787.037. ,006365,740, .00048215 ,00053047 61984.0 169.8189\\'= 169 ♦ 16 44 The decimals in the table being circles of eight figures, we have used them as approximates, by confining the operations to four decimal places ; which, in affairs of this kind, is fuffieiently accurate. If the annual interest of any principal sum be considered as the .yearly penfiop, the interert of the same principal for any number of days may be found by the table as taught above. The interest of any principal sum for a year is easily found, as being always the hundredth part of the produifl of the principal multiplied by the rate per cent. Examp. Required the interest for 26 days of 685 1. principal, at 5 per cent. L. 685 S 34.25 annual interert. 26 In the column of fourths, the decimals run on to eight places of a finite part, and nine figures of a circle ; but the fenite part by itself, which alone is inserted in the sable, will be found sufficient; and in the column of thirds too, the circle of three figures may in most cases be negledted.

Decimal praffice may be used with great advantage in the multiplication and division of duodecimals, where the integer is divided into twelve equal parts, called primes, and each prime into twelve seconds, each second into twelve thirds, &c. For the ready conversion of primes, seconds, thirds, iyc. into decimals of the integer, the following table is conftruffed. 9!°°) 407468.750 10.9632 Anf. 452 8 5 N Vox..

Decimal praftice might likewise be used to good purpose in the arithmetic of fexagefimals, as it would shorten and facilitate the operations. Sexagefimals, ftrittly speaking, are degrees, minutes, seconds, thirds, 6^. where each degree is divided into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 fecpnds, <foc.; but under this title is also usually comprehended the division of a sign into 30 degrees. They are commonly marked as under. Signs, deg. min. see. thirds. 7 24 36 54 48 <bc. Sexagefimals properly belong to astronomy, being used in computations of motion and time, where the degree of motion, and hour of time, are equally divided into 60 minutes. The preference of the decimal method to that of the fexagefimal will appear from the following example of addition done both ways. Sexagefimally. Decimally. Signs. ° * 5. 10 20 47 17 = 10.69293,518, 7 18 50 40= 7.62814,814, 9 25 30 28 = 9.85018,518, 11 10 40 50= 11.35601,851, 3 x 5 49 7 = 3•52728,703, From the above example it is obvious, that even in addition the decimal operation is more simple and easy than the fexagefimal, especially if care be taken to use no more decimal places than what are absolutely noceffary. But in multiplication and division the advantage of the decimal method is still greater; for in the fexagefimaf way the operation is extremely tedious; whereas, by working decimally, it is performed in the same manner, and with the same ease, as in duodecimals. Vulgar Fractions. Decimal practice may sometimes be profitably used in theK. the arithmetic of vulgar fractions, the operation being fiiarter and easier in the decimal than in the vulgar way.

If unity be multiplied continually by any given number, the produ&s thence afifing are called powers of that number; and the given number is called the root, or firjl Thus, if 2 be the given number, then 1X2=2 is the root or first power ; and 2X2=4 * s t^e fqnaie or second power; and 4X2=8 is the cube or third power; andis the biquadrate or fourth power; and 16X 2=32 is the furfolid or fifth power; and 32X2=64 is the sixth power, or cube squared, <&c. The natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, <bc. are sometimes placed over these powers, denoting the number of Multiplications used in producing them, of (bowing what powers they are ; and are called indices or exponents, as in the following scheme. Indices, o, 1, 2, 3, 41 5, 6, 7, he. Powers, i, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, tec. The raising any root or number given to any power required, is called involution; and is performed by multiplying the given root into unity continually, as taught above. But the finding the root of a given power is or ext raft ion of roots. If the root of any power not exceeding the seventh power, be a single digit, it may be obtained by inspection, from the following table of powers. T A B L E. 1200 : 5 :: 604.133 The Ample separate operations of the same example I. Extra st ion of the Square Root. Rule I. Divide the given number into periods of two figures, beginning at the right hand in integers, and pointing toward the left. But in decimals, begin at the place of hundreds, and point toward the right. Every period will give one figure in the root. II. Find by the table of powers, or by trial, the nearest lesser root of the left-hand period, place the figure so found in the quot, fubtradl its square from the said period, and to the remainder bring down the next period for a dividual or refolvend. III. Double the quot for the first part of the divifor; inquire bow often this first part is contained in the whole refolvend, excluding the units place; and place the figure denoting the answer both in the quot and onthe right of the first part; and you have the divifor complete. IV. Multiply the divifor thus compleated by the figure put in the quot, fubtratt the product from the refolvend,\\' and to the remainder bring down the following period for a new refolvend, and then proceed as before. Note 1. If the first part of the divifor, with unity supposed to be annexed to it, happen to be greater than the refolvend, in this case place o in the quot, and also on the sight of the partial divifor; tothe refolvend bring down another period; and proceed to divide as before. Note a. If the product, of the quotient-figure into the divifor happen to be greater than the refolvend, youmuft go back, and give a lefler figure to the quot. Note 3. If, after every period of the given number is brought down, there happen at last to be a remainder, you may continue the operation, by annexing periods or pairs of ciphers, till there be no remainder, or till the decimal part of the quot repeat or circulate, or till you think proper to limit it.

Thus, the square root of 4 is 4> an( I the root of i $ r > an< I thus the root of y (=65) is t— 2-j-. But if the root of either the numerator or denominator cannot be extracted without a remainder, reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal, and then extra Ct the root, as in Example HI. above. II. Extraction of the Cube Root. Rule I. Divide the given number into periods of three figures, beginning at the right hand in integers, and pointing toward the left. But in decimals, begin at the place of thousands, and point toward the right. The number of periods ftiews the number of figures in the root. II. Find by the table of powers, or by trial, the nearest lefler root of the left-hand period; place the figure so found in the quot; fubtrad its cube from the said period; and to the remainder bring down the next period for a dividual or refolvend. The divifor consists of three parts which may be found as follows. III. The first part of the divifor is found thus: Multiply the square of the quot by 3, and to the product annex two ciphers; then inquire how often this first part of the divifor is contained in the refolvend, and place the figure denoting the answer in the quot. IV. Multiply the former quot by 3, and the product by the figure now put in the quot; to this last product annex a cipher; and you have the second part of the divifor. Again, square the figure now put in the quot for the third part of the divifor; place these three parts under one another, as in addition; and itheir sum will be the divifor complete. V. Multiply the divifor, thus completed, -by the figure last pur in the quot, fubtra Ct the product from the refolvend, and to the remainder bring down the following period for a new refolvend, and then proceed as before. Note 1. If the first part of the divifor happen to be equal to or greater than the refolvend, in this case place o in the quot, annex two ciphers to the said first part of the divifor, to the refolvend bring down another period, and proceed to divide as before. Note 2. If the product of the quotient-figure into the divifor happen to be greater than the refolvend, you must go back, and give a lefler figure to the quot. Note 3. If, after every period of the given number is brought down, there happen at last to be a remainder, you may continue the operation by annexing periods of three ciphers till there be no remainder, or till you have 5 O as 3many decimal places in the root as you judge necefExamp.

(°) VII. Extraftion of the root of the eighth power. Rule. Extra# the square root of the given number. Rule. Extra# the cube root of the given number,, and you have the cube or third power, whose cube root is the\\'root fought. Thus, let 5159780352 by the ninth power; by extra#ing the cube root you get the cube or third power, viz. 1728, whose cube root 12 is the root fought. Universally, whatever the given power be, put a + y for the root, and by involution raise a -j-y to the power of the given number; then, with this^ as your guide or canon, extra# the root in the manner prescribed and exemplified in the extra#ion of the root of the fifth and seventh powers. But if the index of the given power be a multiple of 2, the work may be rendered easier: For, by extra#ing the square root of the given number, you obtain a power ’whose index is one half of the index of the given power. Thus, by extra#ing the square root of the tenth power, you have the fifth power ; and the square root of the twelth power is the sixth power, &c. Again, if the index of the given power be a multiple of 3, by extra#ing the cube root you obtain a power whose index is one third of the index of the power given. Thus the cube root of the ninth power is the cube or third power ; and the cube root of the twelfth power is the biquadrate or fourth power, ire. Involution is dtre#ly contrary to extra#ion or evolution ; and therefore, if a square number be squared, it will give the biquadrate or fourth power; and if a biquadrate be squared, it will give the eighth power. Again, if a cube number be cubed, it will give the ninth power ; and if the biquadrate.be cubed, it will give the twelfth powerj See Algebra, Chap. IX. and X.

A K K The ark has aflbrded several points of curious inquiry among, the critics and haturalifts, relating to its form, capacity, materials, ic. The wood whereof the ark was built, is called in the Hebrew Gopher-wood, and in the Septuagint fqxare timbers. Some translate Ahe original cedar, others pine, others\\' *lox. See. Pelletier .prefers cedar, on account of its incorruptibility, and the great plenty of it in Alia; whence Herodotus and Theophraftus relate, that the kings of Egypt and Syria built whole fleets thereof, The learned .Mr Fuller in his Mifcellanies, has observed, that the wood whereof the ark was built, was nothing else but that which the Greek call xo Trag/crcros, or the cypress-tree ; for, taking away the termination, kupar and gopher differ very little in found. This observation the great Bochart has confirmed, and fliewn very plainly that no country abounds so much with this wood as that part of Assyria which Kes about Ba In what place Noah built and finilhed his ark is no less made a matter of difputa:tion. But the moll probable opinion is, that it was built in Chaldasa, in the territories of Babylon, where there was so great a quantity of cypress in the groves and gardens in Alexander’s time, that that prince built a whole fleet out of it, for want of timber. And this conjefture is confirmed by the Chaldean tradition, which makes Xithurus (another name for Noah) set fail from that country. The dimensions of the ark, as given by Moses, are 300 cubits in length, 50 in breadth, and 30 in height, which some have thought too scanty, considering the number of things it was to contain ; and hence an argument has been drawn against the authority of the relation. To solve this difficulty many of the ancient fathers, and the modern critics, have been put to very miserable fliifts: But Buteo and Kircher have proved geometrically, that, taking the common cubit of a foot and a half, the ark was abundantly sufficient for all the animals supposed to be lodged in it. Snellius computes the ark to have been above half an acre in area, and father Lamy shews, that it was no feet longer than the church of St Mary at Paris, and 64 feet narrower; and if so, it mull have been longer than St Paul’s church in London, from west to east; and broader than that church is high in the inside, and 54 feet* of our measure in height; and Dr Arbuthnot computes it to have been 81062 tuns. The things contained in it were, besides eight persons of Noah’s family, one pair of every species of unclean animals, and seven pair of every species of clean animals, with provilions for them all during the whole year. The former appears, at first view, almost infinite; but if we come to a calculation, the number of species of animals will be found much less than is generally imagined, not amounting to an hundred species of quadrupeds, nor to two hundred of birds ; out of which, in this case, are excepted such animals as can live in the water. Zoologifts usually reckon but an hundred and seventy species in all; andbilhop Wilkins Ihews that only seventy-two of the q uadruped kind needed a place By the defeription Moses gives of the ark, it appears to have been divided into three stories, each ten cubits, or fifteen feet, high ; and it is agreed on, as most probable, that the lowest story was for ,the beasts, the middle for the food, and the upper for the birds, with Noah and his family ; each story being subdivided into different apartments, stalls, fac. Though Jofephus, Philo, and other commentators, add a kind of fourth story under all the rest ; being, as it were, the hold of the vessel, to contain the ballast, and receive the filth and faeces of so many animals : But F. Calmet thinks, that what is here reckoned a story, was no more than what is called the keel of fltips, and served only for a conservatory of frelh water. Drexelius makes three hundred apartments. F. Fournier, three hundred and thirty-three; the anonymous author of the Questions on Genesis, four hundred; Buteo, Temporarius, Arias Montanus, Hoftus, Wilkins, Lamy, and others, suppose a\\' s many partitions as there\\' were different sorts of animals. Pelletier makes only sev.enty-two, viz. thirty-six for the birds, -and as many for the beasts ; his reason is, that if we suppose a greater number, as 333, or 400, each of the eight persons in the ark must have had thirty-seven, forty-one, or fifty stalls to attend and cleanse daily, which he thinks impofiible to have been done. But it is observed, that there is not much in this; to dimini(h the number of stalls without a diminution of animals is vain; it being perhaps more difficult to take care of three hundred animals in seventy-two stalls, than in three hundred. As to the number of animals chntained in the ark, Buteo computes that it could not be equal to five hundred horses ; he even reduces the whole to the dimensions of fifty-six pair of oxen. F. Lamy enlarges it to sixty.-four pair of oxen, or an hundred and twenty-eight oxen ; so that supposing one ox equal to two horses, if the ark had room for two hundred and fifty-six horses, there must have been roorrf for all the animals. But the same author demonstrates, that one floor of it would suffice for five hundred horses, allowing nine square feet to a horse. As to the food in the second story, it is observed by Buteo from Columella, that thirty or forty pounds of hay ordinalily suffices for an ox a day, and that a solid cubit of hay, as usually pressed down in our hayricks, weighs about forty pounds; so that a square cubit of hay is more than enough for one ox . in one day. Now it appears that the second story contained 150,000 solid cubits, which divided between two hundred and six oxen, will afford each more hay by two thirds, than he can eat in a year. Biftiop Wilkins computes all the carnivorous animals, equivalent, as to the bulk of their bodies, and their food, to twenty-seven wolves; and all the rest to two hundred and eighty beeves. For the former he allows 1825 sheep, and for the latter, 109,500 cubits of hay, all which will be easily contained in the two first stories, and a deal of room to spare. As to the third story, no body doubts*of its beipg sufficient for the fowls; with Noah, Jiis sons, and daughters. .Upon the whole, the learned bishop remarks, that of the two, it appears much more difficult to afftgn a number and bulk of necessary things to answer ^ the capacity of the ark, than to find sufficient room for the several species of animals already known to have been there. 1 his Ee attributes to the imperfe&ion of our list of animals, e-',\n  'uri': 'https://w3id.org/hto/TopicTermRecord/992277653804341_144133901_ARITHMETICK_0'},\n {'new': 'a sea-port town of Ireland, situated in the county of Wicklow, about thirteen miles south of the city of Wicklow, in 6f 20.
