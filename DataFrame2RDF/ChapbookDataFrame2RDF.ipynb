King William's succeeding, and the manner of his losing his life. IV. And after him our Gracious Queen Anne her succeeding the throne: all which are accomplished accordingly. And also great and wonderful things concerning the conversion of the Jews and Turks to the Christian religion, and the glorious days of the Gospel, in bringing about of which Scotland shall mainly be instrumental, which great things cannot but be very acceptable to all good Christians.
